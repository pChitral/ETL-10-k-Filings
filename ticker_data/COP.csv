The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 30,000 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2009 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. • Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). • Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 32 Table of Contents The business environment for the energy industry in 2009 continued to experience volatility associated with the supply/demand factors that drive its commodity prices and margins. During 2008, forecasts of worldwide economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S. dollar, and other factors helped drive crude oil prices to record highs by mid-year, with the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) peaking at almost $150 per barrel. This was followed by an abrupt shift into a severe global financial recession, which drove crude oil prices to the low-$30-per-barrel range by the end of 2008. As the global economy began to recover, oil prices steadily improved during 2009 and have remained fairly strong due to demand in Asia. The recovery from the recession in the United States, however, has been slower and has impacted demand for U.S. natural gas and refined products. In response to this challenging business environment, ConocoPhillips announced several strategic initiatives in late 2009 designed to improve its financial position and increase returns on capital. This will be accomplished primarily through a combination of enhanced capital discipline and asset portfolio rationalization, consistent with our objectives of creating shareholder value and improving financial flexibility, while pursuing long-term strategic projects. Our total capital program in 2010 is expected to be $11.2 billion, down from a budgeted $12.5 billion in 2009. To improve our financial position and strengthen the balance sheet, we intend to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. Proceeds will be targeted to debt reduction, accelerating the return to our targeted debt-to-capital ratio of 20 percent to 25 percent. After these initiatives, we intend to continue to replace reserves and increase production from a reduced, but more strategic, asset base. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. As noted above, these prices and margins are subject to extreme volatility. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2009, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2008. The lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our U.S. and German refineries due to economic conditions, as well as higher planned downtime, efficiently utilizing periods of lower margins for maintenance. Although certain North America production was shut-in during part of 2009 due to the natural gas pricing environment, we increased total production on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent basis in 2009 by 2 percent. Finally, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ending December 31, 2009, our reserve replacement was 145 percent. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. 33 Table of Contents • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs were reduced 13 percent in 2009, compared with 2008, reflecting both market conditions and our continued emphasis on cost control throughout the year. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $10.9 billion in 2009, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $10.5 billion in 2010. The 2010 budget is consistent with our recently announced plan to improve returns through increased capital discipline, while still funding existing projects and enabling us to preserve flexibility to develop major projects in the future. In addition to our capital program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.8 billion in 2009. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. In 2008, we sold our retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, in addition to our E&P properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. In 2009, we sold a majority of our U.S. retail marketing assets. Also in 2009, we announced our intention to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, natural gas prices, production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. 34 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil prices, natural gas prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2009 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily related to certain natural gas properties in western Canada and our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG). Before-tax impairments in 2008, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL investment, totaled $1.7 billion. • Goodwill. At year-end 2009 and 2008, we had $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year-end 2007. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our E&P segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year-end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. For additional information, see Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4.5 billion after-tax impairment. In the second quarter of 2009, our assets in Ecuador were effectively expropriated, and we recorded a $51 million before- and after-tax impairment (see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We were also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009, so that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices. In October 2008, we and our co-venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan Field, to allow the state-owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 35 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were lower in 2009, compared with 2008, averaging $61.69 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38 percent. Crude oil prices steadily trended upward during 2009, as global crude inventories were reduced due to lower production and economic recovery that stimulated the resumption of global oil demand growth. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub decreased 56 percent during 2009 to an average price of $3.99 per million British thermal units, primarily as a result of lower demand due to the U.S. recession and higher domestic production due to increased shale gas production. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices decreased 43 percent in 2009. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins remained weak in 2009. The U.S. benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread decreased almost 20 percent in 2009, while the N.W. Europe benchmark declined 54 percent. Demand, particularly for distillates, continued to be suppressed by the global economic slowdown. In addition, the compressed differential in prices for high-quality crude oil, compared with those of lower-quality crude oil, reduced margins for those refineries configured to capitalize on the ability to process lower-quality crudes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOIL’s results are subject to factors similar to those of our E&P and R&M segments. LUKOIL’s upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals) crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are significant factors on LUKOIL’s downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 3,604 (13,479 ) 4,615 Midstream 313 541 453 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 37 2,322 5,923 LUKOIL Investment 1,663 (5,488 ) 1,818 Chemicals 248 110 359 Emerging Businesses 3 30 (8 ) Corporate and Other (1,010 ) (1,034 ) (1,269 ) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 4,858 (16,998 ) 11,891 2009 vs. 2008 The improved results in 2009 were primarily the result of: • The absence of a $25,443 million before- and after-tax impairment of all E&P segment goodwill in 2008. • The absence of a $7,410 million before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment in 2008. • Lower production taxes. • Reduced operating and overhead expenses. These items were partially offset by: • Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which impacted our E&P, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. • Lower refining margins in our R&M segment. 2008 vs. 2007 The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of: • The goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, noted above. • Lower U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment. • An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our E&P and R&M segments. These items were partially offset by: • Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which benefitted our E&P, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits were somewhat counteracted by increased production taxes. • A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before-tax, $4,512 million after-tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation. 37 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 38 percent in 2009, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 39 percent. These decreases were mainly the result of significantly lower prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 30 percent in 2009, primarily due to reduced earnings from DCP Midstream; LUKOIL; Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP); Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bhd.; and Excel Paralubes, which were partially offset by higher earnings from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The decreases were mainly the result of lower commodity prices and refining margins. Other income decreased 52 percent during 2009. The decrease was primarily due to 2008 gains related to asset dispositions in our E&P and R&M segments. Production and operating expenses decreased 13 percent in 2009, as a result of lower utilities costs, favorable foreign exchange impacts, and our cost reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 18 percent in 2009, primarily due to disposition of U.S. and international marketing assets. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 25 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices, as well as reduced excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Impairments decreased from $34,539 million in 2008 to $535 million in 2009, primarily reflecting the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments. Other impairments decreased $1,202 million during 2009. For additional information, see Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, and Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased 38 percent in 2009, as a result of a higher average debt level, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense also increased as a result of lower capitalized interest. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and other operating revenues increased 28 percent in 2008, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. These increases were the result of higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 38 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting: • Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture. • Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. • The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in 2007. • Increased losses related to our NMNG joint venture as a result of higher production taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs during the startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) Field. These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Partnership, DCP Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties. Other income decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. Exploration expenses increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs and higher expenses for post-discovery feasibility and development planning studies. Impairments increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This increase primarily reflects the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, partially offset by a 2007 impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. Interest and debt expense decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Foreign currency transaction losses incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents Segment Results E&P 2009 2008 2007 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska $ 1,540 2,315 2,255 Lower 48 (37 ) 2,673 1,993 United States 1,503 4,988 4,248 International 2,101 6,976 367 Goodwill impairment — (25,443 ) — $ 3,604 (13,479 ) 4,615 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil and natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States $ 53.21 89.38 63.87 International 57.40 89.32 68.09 Total consolidated operations 55.47 89.35 66.01 Equity affiliates 58.23 71.15 48.72 Total E&P 55.63 88.91 64.99 Synthetic oil (per barrel) International 62.01 103.31 74.32 Bitumen (per barrel) International 39.67 46.85 — Equity affiliates 45.69 58.54 37.94 Total E&P 44.84 56.72 37.94 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 3.45 7.67 5.98 International 4.94 8.76 6.51 Total consolidated operations 4.30 8.28 6.26 Equity affiliates 2.35 2.04 .30 Total E&P 4.26 8.27 6.26 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 7.73 8.34 6.52 International* 7.72 8.03 7.64 Total consolidated operations* 7.73 8.17 7.11 Equity affiliates 7.68 13.36 8.92 Total E&P* 7.72 8.33 7.19 * Amounts in 2008 and 2007 were adjusted for certain production cost reclassifications.

Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. Equity affiliate statistics exclude our share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. The E&P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2009, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia. 41 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 The E&P segment had earnings of $3,604 million during 2009. In 2008, the E&P segment had a loss of $13,479 million, which included a $25,443 million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E&P segment goodwill. For additional information, see the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact from the goodwill impairment, earnings from the E&P segment decreased 70 percent during 2009, primarily due to substantially lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Our E&P segment also recognized property impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by lower Alaska and Lower 48 production taxes due to lower prices, as well as higher international volumes and improved operating costs. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. Proved reserves at year-end 2009 were 8.36 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 8.08 billion at year-end 2008. This excludes the estimated 1,967 million BOE and 1,893 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also excluded for 2008 is our share of Canadian Syncrude reserves of 249 million barrels. U.S. E&P Earnings from our U.S. E&P operations decreased 70 percent, due to significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Lower production taxes, lower property impairments in the Lower 48 and improved operating costs partially offset the decrease. U.S. E&P production averaged 755,000 BOE per day in 2009, a decrease of 3 percent from 775,000 in 2008. Less unplanned downtime and improved well performance were more than offset by field decline. International E&P Earnings from our international E&P operations were $2,101 million in 2009, compared with $6,976 million in 2008. The decline was primarily a result of significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. International E&P production averaged 1,099,000 BOE per day in 2009, an increase of 8 percent from 1,014,000 in 2008. The increase was predominantly due to new production in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Norway and Vietnam. In addition, production increased due to the impacts from the royalty framework in Alberta, Canada, as well as less unplanned downtime and the impact of lower prices on production sharing arrangements. These increases were partially offset by field decline and more planned downtime. 2008 vs. 2007 The E&P segment recorded a loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount included a $25,443 million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E&P segment goodwill. In 2007, the E&P segment had earnings of $4,615 million, which included the impact of a $4,588 million before-tax impairment ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, and the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. 42 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings resulted from the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than income (mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs, increased property impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our E&P segment recognized property impairment charges totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada. U.S. E&P Earnings from our U.S. E&P operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48, and higher operating costs. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from 843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily attributable to field decline and unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 due to hurricane disruptions. International E&P Earnings from our international E&P operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976 million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the Venezuelan impairment on our prior-year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. International E&P production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from 1,037,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new developments in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada.

The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased 42 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to substantially lower realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by the recognition of an $88 million after-tax benefit in the first quarter of 2009 resulting from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. 2008 vs. 2007 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense. 44 Table of Contents R&M 2009 2008 2007 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips United States $ (192 ) 1,540 4,615 International 229 782 1,308 $ 37 2,322 5,923 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Wholesale Prices* Gasoline $ 1.84 2.65 2.27 Distillates 1.76 3.06 2.29 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2007 was 2,037,000 barrels per day for our domestic refineries and 669,000 barrels per day for our international refineries. The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region. 45 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 R&M reported earnings of $37 million in 2009, compared with $2,322 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of significantly lower U.S. and international refining margins, lower volumes, lower international marketing margins and a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower property impairments and positive foreign currency exchange impacts. During 2008, our R&M segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. During 2009, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2008. U.S. R&M Our U.S. R&M operations reported a loss of $192 million in 2009, compared with earnings of $1,540 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower U.S. refining margins, lower U.S. refining and marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower property impairments. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2009, compared with 92 percent in 2008. The current-year rate was mainly affected by run reductions due to market conditions and increased turnaround activity, while the prior-year rate was impacted by downtime associated with hurricanes. International R&M International R&M reported earnings of $229 million in 2009 and earnings of $782 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower international refining and marketing margins, lower international marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by positive foreign currency impacts, lower property impairments and lower operating expenses. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in 2009, compared with 85 percent in 2008. The current-year rate reflects higher turnaround activity. In addition, the utilization rate for both periods reflects run reductions in response to market conditions. 2008 vs. 2007 R&M earnings decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to decreases in U.S. refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating costs, a reduced benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and refining volumes due to asset sales. These R&M decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. U.S. R&M Earnings from our U.S. R&M operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. Results for 2008 also included an impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in 2007. The decline in the 2008 rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and unplanned downtime, which included the impact of hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. International R&M Earnings from our international R&M operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the decrease was the impairment of a refinery in Europe and the absence of a $141 million 2007 German tax legislation benefit. 46 Table of Contents Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90 percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude throughput at our Wilhelmshaven Refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 1,663 (5,488 ) 1,818 Operating Statistics* Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 387 386 401 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 280 356 256 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 245 229 214 * Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.09 percent at that date. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future-period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2009 vs. 2008 The LUKOIL Investment segment had earnings of $1,663 million during 2009, compared with a loss of $5,488 million in 2008. Results for 2008 included a $7,410 million noncash, before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment decreased 13 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated realized refined product and crude oil prices, which was mostly offset by lower estimated extraction taxes and export tariff rates, and a benefit from basis difference amortization. 2008 vs. 2007 The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million loss in 2008, compared with $1,818 million of earnings in 2007. Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 6 percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized prices of both refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff rates, as well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes. 47 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 248 110 359 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $138 million in 2009 due to lower operating costs and higher margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. These increases were partially offset by lower margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. 2008 vs. 2007 Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased by $249 million in 2008 due to higher utilities and other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one-time tax benefits, lower margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line, and lower volumes from the olefins and polyolefins business line. Increases in olefins and polyolefins margins somewhat offset these negative effects. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 105 106 53 Other (102 ) (76 ) (61 ) $ 3 30 (8 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2009 vs. 2008 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $3 million in 2009, compared with $30 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower international power results and higher technology development expenses, which were mostly offset by the absence of an $85 million after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $30 million in 2008, compared with a loss of $8 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results, including the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85 million after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power results. 48 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (851 ) (558 ) (820 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (108 ) (202 ) (176 ) Acquisition/merger-related costs — — (44 ) Other (51 ) (274 ) (229 ) $ (1,010 ) (1,034 ) (1,269 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 53 percent in 2009 as a result of higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2009. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 47 percent due to decreased costs related to compensation plans and overhead. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the “Other” category are primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction gains. 2008 vs. 2007 Net interest decreased 32 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates and a higher effective tax rate. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2008, mainly as a result of increased charitable contributions. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. “Other” expenses increased in 2008 due to various tax-related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. 49 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,479 22,658 24,550 Short-term debt 1,728 370 1,398 Total debt* 28,653 27,455 21,687 Total equity 63,057 56,265 90,156 Percent of total debt to capital** 31 % 33 19 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 9 37 25 * Total debt includes short-term and long-term debt, as shown on our consolidated balance sheet. ** Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2009 $1,229 million of net debt was issued, and we received $1,270 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2009, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements to FCCL Partnership. Total dividends paid on our common stock during the year were $2,832 million. During 2009, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $213 million to $542 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper markets in the United States, have experienced adverse conditions during 2008 and 2009. Although we have not been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our ability, the ability of our joint ventures and equity affiliates, and the ability of third parties with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2009, cash of $12,479 million was provided by operating activities, a 45 percent decrease from cash from operations of $22,658 million in 2008. The decline was primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices in our E&P segment and lower refining margins in our R&M segment. During 2008, cash flow from operations decreased $1,892 million, compared with 2007. Contributing to the decrease were lower U.S. refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our R&M segment in 2008, versus reductions in 2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices in our E&P segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Crude oil and natural gas prices generally trended higher during 2009. Refining margins deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 50 Table of Contents remained low throughout 2009. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our production for 2009, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.29 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2010, including the impact of anticipated dispositions, is expected to be in the range of 2.2 million BOE per day, similar to 2008 production levels. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our recently announced disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2010 and future years’ production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2009 was 141 percent, including 133 percent from consolidated operations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new reserves reporting rules effective in 2009, which allowed us to include Syncrude oil sands mining operations in our proved reserves. Excluding the impact of the addition of Syncrude, we replaced 112 percent of total production in 2009, reflecting progress on major projects, including the sanctioning of additional phases of in-situ oil sands projects in Canada, as well as reserve additions from our LUKOIL Investment segment. Over the five-year period ending December 31, 2009, our reserve replacement was 145 percent, including 120 percent from consolidated operations. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2009 and 2007, revisions increased reserves, while in 2008 revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. 51 Table of Contents Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2009 were $1,270 million, compared with $1,640 million in 2008. In 2009, we closed on the sale of our ownership interest in the Keystone Pipeline and a large part of our U.S. retail marketing assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million five-year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million. We plan to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. We will continue to identify the assets and begin marketing efforts over the near term, with disposition candidates across the company’s operations being considered. Proceeds will be targeted toward debt reduction. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2009, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 Project. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,300 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2009, compared with $6,933 million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $1,300 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under SEC shelf registrations, in early February 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039, and in May 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and an additional $500 million of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds from these notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances and for general corporate purposes. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investor Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility and our $500 million credit facility. Noncontrolling Interests At December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had $590 million and $1,100 million, respectively, of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. The decline from year-end 2008 was primarily due to Ashford Energy Capital S.A. redeeming for $500 million, 52 Table of Contents plus accrued dividends, the investment in Ashford held by Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. in the third quarter of 2009. The remaining noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2009, primarily represent operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $565 million, was related to Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, located in Australia’s Northern Territory. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2009, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: • Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2009, Qatargas 3 had approximately $3.6 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $1 billion, and an additional $88 million of accrued interest. • Rockies Express Pipeline: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Rockies Express completed construction of a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States in November 2009. Shortly after completion, ConocoPhillips increased its ownership from 24 to 25 percent. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $500 million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2009, Rockies Express had $1,673 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 25 percent guarantee equaling $418 million. The guarantee expires in April 2011. However, it is anticipated refinancing of all or a portion of the $2 billion credit facility will take place in 2010, which is expected to reduce our guarantee exposure. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2009, was $28.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion during 2009, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 31 percent at year-end 2009, versus 33 percent at the end of 2008. The change in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to an increase in equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. During 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of 6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity, and prepaid $750 million of Floating Rate Five-Year Term Notes. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana (now Cenovus). As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation 53 Table of Contents amount, approximately $660 million was short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2009, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $625 million in 2009, are included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have provided loan financing to WRB Refining LLC, to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. At December 31, 2009, $350 million of such financing was outstanding and was classified as long term. In February 2010, we announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 22, 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2009: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2-3 4-5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 28,622 1,719 6,311 2,806 17,786 Capital lease obligations 31 9 6 3 13 Total debt 28,653 1,728 6,317 2,809 17,799 Interest on debt and other obligations 20,680 1,678 2,866 2,363 13,773 Operating lease obligations 3,377 872 1,166 618 721 Purchase obligations (b) 112,131 45,291 13,615 9,088 44,137 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 5,669 660 1,427 1,586 1,996 Other long-term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,295 407 519 532 6,837 Accrued environmental costs 1,017 192 222 113 490 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 60 60 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 179,882 50,888 26,132 17,109 85,753 (a) Includes $502 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL), natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $58,935 million. In addition, $40,739 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining term of 90 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 15 years. Purchase obligations of $8,226 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. 54 Table of Contents The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a seven-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions—for the 2010 through 2014 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $540 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $530 million for 2010 and then approximately $540 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2010 is expected to be $130 million in the United States and $170 million outside the United States. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $1,148 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2010 is $10.5 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 85 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 13 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2010 is approximately $11.2 billion. 55 Table of Contents E&P Capital expenditures and investments for E&P during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, totaled $35.3 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: • Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. • The initial investment in 2008 related to the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) 50/50 joint venture and subsequent expenditures to advance the associated coalbed methane projects. • Oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area, the Western North Slope and the Cook Inlet Area; and exploration. • Development drilling and facilities projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area, Alvheim, Heidrun and Statfjord, located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay. • The Kashagan Field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea offshore Kazakhstan. • In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, the Britannia satellite developments and various southern and central North Sea assets. • Development of the YK Field in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL. • Investment in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. • Significant U.S. lease acquisitions in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea offshore Alaska, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • The North Belut Field, as well as other projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • The Qatargas 3 Project, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. • The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. 2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget is $8.9 billion, which is essentially the same as actual expenditures in 2009. Twenty-eight percent of E&P’s 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to be directed toward the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk Fields, as well as the Alpine Field and satellites on the Western North Slope. In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development in the San Juan and Permian Basins and the Bakken and Lobo Trends. Also, we expect to direct capital spending towards exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford shale position in Texas. E&P is directing $6.5 billion of its 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2010 will be directed to developing major long-term projects including: • Canadian oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in the western Canada gas basins. • Further development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Completion of the Qatargas 3 Project in Qatar. • Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region, continued development of Bohai Bay in China, new fields offshore Malaysia, offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia, and offshore Vietnam. • In the North Sea, the Ekofisk Area, Greater Britannia Fields, various southern North Sea assets, and development of the Jasmine discovery in the J Block and the Clair Ridge Project. • The Kashagan Field in the Caspian Sea. 56 Table of Contents • Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya. • Exploration activities in Australia’s Browse Basin, Kazakhstan’s Block N, offshore eastern Canada, offshore Indonesia and the North Sea, as well as a coal seam gas play in China and shale gas play in Poland. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated cost to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $5.4 billion, representing 13 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Installation of a 20,000 barrel-per-day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. • Installation of a 25,000 barrel-per-day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger Refinery. • Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable production of low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur fuels. • Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber Refinery. • Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale Refinery. • Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, and associated investment to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. We disposed of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline in 2009. Major construction activities in progress include: • Installation of a 65,000 barrel-per-day coker and a major reconfiguration of the Wood River Refinery to handle advantaged crude and increase capacity, partially funded through long-term advances from ConocoPhillips. • U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2010 capital budget is $1.3 billion, a 24 percent decrease from actual spending in 2009, with about $0.9 billion for its U.S. downstream businesses and $0.4 billion for international R&M. These funds will be used for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance and reliability. As previously announced, the refinery upgrade project at Wilhelmshaven has been delayed. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue a liability for known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes) when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is 57 Table of Contents accrued. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007, which was signed in 58 Table of Contents December 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with further increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. Implementing regulations and standards for 2010 and beyond remain uncertain as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not promulgated final provisions. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2008, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 65 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2009, we resolved and closed two sites, re-opened one site, and received one notice of potential liability, leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,070 million in 2009 and are expected to be about $1.1 billion per year in 2010 and 2011. Capitalized environmental costs were $891 million in 2009 and are expected to be about $830 million per year in 2010 and 2011. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from 59 Table of Contents insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2009. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2009, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,017 million, compared with $979 million at December 31, 2008. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. • California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. • Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007) confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The EPA’s announcement on December 7, 2009, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74, Fed. Reg. 66,495,” finalizing its findings that GHG emissions threaten public health and the environment and that cars and light trucks cause or contribute to this threat. While these findings do not themselves impose any requirements on any industry or company at this time, these findings may lead to greater regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of climate change. 60 Table of Contents In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.” This Statement was codified into FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 860, “Transfers and Servicing.” This Statement removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (SPE) and the exception for qualifying SPEs from the consolidation guidance. Additionally, the Statement clarifies the requirements for financial asset transfers eligible for sale accounting. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Also in June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),” to address the effects of the elimination of the qualifying SPE concept in SFAS No. 166, and other concerns about the application of key provisions of consolidation guidance for variable interest entities (VIEs). This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation.” More specifically, SFAS No. 167 requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it amends certain guidance pertaining to the determination of the primary beneficiary when related parties are involved, and it amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. Additionally, this 61 Table of Contents Statement requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2009, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,466 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $551 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 62 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately 2.5 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2010 would increase by approximately $32 million. The remaining $5,040 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2009 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.6 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $102 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2010. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 62 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2009, total suspended well costs were $908 million, compared with $660 million at year-end 2008. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves 63 Table of Contents also is important to the statement of operations because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2009, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $60 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2009 was approximately $8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.5 billion BOE at the beginning of 2009 and were 5.6 billion BOE at the end of 2009. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2009 would have increased by an estimated $424 million. Impairments of producing properties resulting from downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance were not material in the last three years. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” and “NMNG” sections of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal 64 Table of Contents event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2009, we had $740 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide E&P reporting unit. At December 31, 2009, we had $3,638 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill, including a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $140 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase 65 Table of Contents annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. 66 Table of Contents • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to implement, our recently announced asset disposition plan. • Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of commodity trading around our asset base. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative 67 Table of Contents commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year-end 2009 and 2008 effective yield rate of 2.63 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. 68 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by FASB ASC Topic 815. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2009 or 2008, exchange rates.

Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 65. The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,700 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2010 had assets of $156 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. • Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2010, our ownership interest was 2.25 percent based on issued shares. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on sales of LUKOIL shares. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). • Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 32 Table of Contents In 2010, as the global economy continued to recover from the recession, the business environment for certain parts of the energy industry also recovered. Oil prices continued to increase in 2010, reflecting strong oil demand growth, especially in China, and an improved economic outlook for the United States. U.S. natural gas prices, however, remained under pressure during 2010, despite a colder-than-normal winter and hotter-than-normal summer. U.S. natural gas production continues to increase at a faster rate than the demand recovery from the economic crisis, primarily as a result of increased production from shale plays. Storage levels are below 2009 levels, but remain historically high. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near- to mid-term, and potentially impacting the timing of commercialization of our Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic gas resources. In late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We announced plans to raise $10 billion from asset dispositions through the end of 2011, reduce our debt and increase shareholder distributions. As of year-end 2010, we have generated approximately $7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward debt reduction. This accelerated the return to our target debt-to-capital ratio of 20 to 25 percent. In addition, we increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 10 percent, and we paid dividends on our common stock of $3.2 billion for the full year. We also announced plans to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL, and our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. As of year-end 2010, we had sold approximately 90 percent of our interest in LUKOIL, which generated cash proceeds of approximately $8 billion, while we repurchased approximately $4 billion of our common stock. In February 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. Our total capital program in 2011 is expected to be $13.5 billion, a $2.8 billion increase from $10.7 billion in 2010. We also expect 2011 production to be approximately 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. Crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and LNG prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. These prices and margins can be subject to extreme volatility. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2010, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 81 percent, compared with 84 percent in 2009. The lower rate primarily reflects run reductions at Wilhelmshaven in response to market conditions, partially offset by lower turnaround activity. Excluding Wilhelmshaven, the worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 88 percent in 2009. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), which occurred in April 2010. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. Therefore, in order to improve industry spill response, in 2010 we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc to develop a new oil spill containment system. MWCC plans to build and deploy a rapid response system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the event of a potential future underwater well blowout in the deepwater GOM. 33 Table of Contents • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2010, our reserve replacement was 111 percent, excluding LUKOIL. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased by 4 percent in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily as a result of market conditions and higher transportation costs. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our total capital program in 2010 was $10.7 billion, which included $9.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. Our 2011 capital program is expected to be approximately $13.5 billion, which includes $12.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. The 2011 budget is consistent with our plan to improve returns through increased capital discipline, while still funding existing projects and enabling us to preserve flexibility to develop major projects in the future. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or otherwise disposed. In 2009, we sold a majority of our U.S. retail marketing assets and announced our intention to raise $10 billion from asset dispositions through the end of 2011. In 2010, we completed the U.S. retail marketing disposition program. We also sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated Flying J-branded truck and travel plazas; and several E&P properties located in the Lower 48 and western Canada. As part of a separate program, in 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL. As of year-end 2010, we sold approximately 90 percent of our interest in LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining shares in the first quarter of 2011. 34 Table of Contents • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4 billion and primarily related to the $1.5 billion property impairment of our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany (WRG), and a $0.6 billion impairment of our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG). Before-tax impairments in 2009 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily related to certain natural gas properties in western Canada and our equity investment in NMNG. • Goodwill. We had $3.6 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet at year-end 2010 and 2009. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our E&P segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year-end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations, primarily in E&P, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 35 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2010, compared with 2009, averaging $79.39 per barrel in 2010, an increase of 29 percent. Uncertainty about economic growth in developed countries, especially in the United States, and concerns about the debt crisis in Europe were more than offset by increased demand from China and other developing countries. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub increased 10 percent during 2010 to an average price of $4.39 per million British thermal units, primarily as a result of weather-related events. An increase in demand was offset by higher natural gas production levels, and as a result, natural gas storage levels remain high and have adversely impacted Henry Hub prices. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 39 percent in 2010. Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins improved during 2010, compared with 2009. The U.S. benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread increased 9 percent in 2010, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 16 percent. Demand for refined products improved globally in 2010, driven by the improved economic environment, particularly in the developing nations. In addition, a wider differential in prices for high-quality crude oil relative to lower-quality crude oil improved margins for refineries configured to capitalize on the ability to process lower-quality crudes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At year-end 2009, we had a 20 percent ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, as a result of our plan to divest of our entire interest in LUKOIL, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped recording equity earnings from LUKOIL. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment primarily reflect the realized gain on share sales. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 9,198 3,604 (13,479 ) Midstream 306 313 541 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 192 37 2,322 LUKOIL Investment* 2,503 1,219 (4,839 ) Chemicals 498 248 110 Emerging Businesses (59 ) 3 30 Corporate and Other (1,280 ) (1,010 ) (1,034 ) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 11,358 4,414 (16,349 ) *2009 and 2008 recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. 2010 vs. 2009 The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of: • Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. • Gains of $4,583 million after-tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales. • Improved results from our domestic R&M operations, reflecting higher refining margins. These items were partially offset by: • Impairments totaling $1,928 million after-tax. • Lower production volumes from our E&P segment. 2009 vs. 2008 The improved results in 2009 were primarily the result of: • The absence of a $25,443 million before- and after-tax impairment of all E&P segment goodwill in 2008. • The absence of a $7,496 million before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment in 2008. • Lower production taxes. • Reduced operating and overhead expenses. These items were partially offset by: • Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which impacted our E&P, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. • Lower refining margins in our R&M segment. 37 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2010 vs. 2009 Sales and other operating revenues increased 27 percent in 2010, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 24 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from: • Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. • Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes. • Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes. These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. Gain on dispositions increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects the $2,878 million gain realized from the June 2010 sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation; the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares; gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada; and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale and Note 6—Investment, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the second quarter impairment of WRG. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt levels. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 38 percent in 2009, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 39 percent. These decreases were mainly the result of significantly lower prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 49 percent in 2009, primarily due to reduced earnings from LUKOIL; DCP Midstream; MSLP; Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bhd.; and Excel Paralubes, which were partially offset by higher earnings from CPChem. The decreases were mainly the result of lower commodity prices and refining margins. Gain on dispositions decreased 82 percent during 2009. The decrease was primarily due to 2008 gains related to asset dispositions in our E&P and R&M segments. Production and operating expenses decreased 13 percent in 2009, as a result of lower utilities costs, favorable foreign currency exchange impacts, and our cost reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 18 percent in 2009, primarily due to disposition of U.S. and international marketing assets. 38 Table of Contents Impairments decreased from $34,625 million in 2008 to $535 million in 2009, primarily reflecting the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments. Other impairments decreased $1,151 million during 2009. For additional information, see Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 25 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices, as well as reduced excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense increased 38 percent in 2009, as a result of a higher average debt level, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense also increased as a result of lower capitalized interest. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents Segment Results E&P 2010 2009 2008 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska $ 1,735 1,540 2,315 Lower 48 1,033 (37 ) 2,673 United States 2,768 1,503 4,988 International 6,430 2,101 6,976 Goodwill impairment - - (25,443 ) $ 9,198 3,604 (13,479 ) Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil and natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States $ 69.73 53.21 89.38 International 74.95 57.40 89.32 Total consolidated operations 72.63 55.47 89.35 Equity affiliates 74.81 58.23 71.15 Total E&P 72.77 55.63 88.91 Synthetic oil (per barrel) International 77.56 62.01 103.31 Bitumen (per barrel) International 51.10 39.67 46.85 Equity affiliates 53.43 45.69 58.54 Total E&P 53.06 44.84 56.72 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet)* United States 4.27 3.50 7.60 International 5.60 5.06 8.65 Total consolidated operations 5.07 4.40 8.20 Equity affiliates 2.79 2.35 2.04 Total E&P 4.98 4.37 8.18 *Prior periods reclassified to conform to current year presentation which includes intrasegment transfer pricing.

Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. Equity affiliate statistics exclude our share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. The E&P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2010, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. Total E&P production on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) basis averaged 1,752,000 BOE per day in 2010, compared with 1,854,000 BOE per day in 2009. 41 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from our E&P segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3,604 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 earnings primarily resulted from higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. In addition, 2010 earnings benefitted from the $2,679 million after-tax gain on sale of Syncrude and higher gains from other asset rationalization efforts. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil, natural gas and synthetic oil volumes, higher petroleum and export taxes as a result of higher prices, and the NMNG impairment. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower depreciation, depletion and amortization. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an unfavorable tax ruling. U.S. E&P production averaged 686,000 BOE per day in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000 BOE in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production. International E&P International E&P earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after-tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi. International E&P production averaged 1,066,000 BOE per day in 2010, a decrease of 3 percent from 1,099,000 BOE in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia. 2009 vs. 2008 The E&P segment had earnings of $3,604 million during 2009. In 2008, the E&P segment had a loss of $13,479 million, which included a $25,443 million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E&P segment goodwill. Excluding the impact from the goodwill impairment, earnings from the E&P segment decreased 70 percent during 2009, primarily due to substantially lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Our E&P segment also recognized property impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by lower Alaska and Lower 48 production taxes due to lower prices, as well as higher international volumes and improved operating costs. U.S. E&P Earnings from our U.S. E&P operations decreased 70 percent, due to significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Lower production taxes, lower property impairments in the Lower 48 and improved operating costs partially offset the decrease. U.S. E&P production averaged 755,000 BOE per day in 2009, a decrease of 3 percent from 775,000 BOE per day in 2008. Less unplanned downtime and improved well performance were more than offset by field decline. 42 Table of Contents International E&P Earnings from our international E&P operations were $2,101 million in 2009, compared with $6,976 million in 2008. The decline was primarily a result of significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. International E&P production averaged 1,099,000 BOE per day in 2009, an increase of 8 percent from 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2008. The increase was predominantly due to new production in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Norway and Vietnam. In addition, production increased due to the impacts from the royalty framework in Alberta, Canada, as well as less unplanned downtime and the impact of lower prices on production sharing arrangements. These increases were partially offset by field decline and planned downtime.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2010 vs. 2009 Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher natural gas liquids prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate, Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009 recognition of an $88 million after-tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses resulting from higher turnaround activity contributed to the decrease in earnings. 43 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased 42 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to substantially lower realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by the recognition of the $88 million after-tax benefit resulting from the conversion of subordinated units to common units.

Our R&M segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buys, sells and transports crude oil; and buys, transports, distributes and markets petroleum products. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 44 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 R&M reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $37 million in 2009. Earnings for 2010 included the $1,124 million after-tax property impairment of WRG. Excluding the impact of this impairment, earnings were significantly improved during 2010 due to higher global refining margins. Results also benefitted from a $113 million after-tax gain on the sale of CFJ and higher refining and marketing volumes. These increases were partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry refining margins. U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime. International R&M International R&M reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 primarily resulted from the WRG impairment and a $29 million after-tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign currency losses. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74 percent in 2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflects run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions. We are currently exploring options to either pursue the sale of WRG or operate it as a terminal. As a result, effective January 1, 2011, we no longer include its capacity in our stated refining capacities or our capacity utilization metrics. 2009 vs. 2008 R&M reported earnings of $37 million in 2009, compared with $2,322 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of significantly lower U.S. and international refining margins, lower volumes, lower international marketing margins and a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower property impairments and positive foreign currency impacts. During 2008, our R&M segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. U.S. R&M Our U.S. R&M operations reported a loss of $192 million in 2009, compared with earnings of $1,540 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower U.S. refining margins, lower U.S. refining and marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower property impairments. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2009, compared with 92 percent in 2008. The rate for 2009 was mainly affected by run reductions due to market conditions and increased turnaround activity, while the 2008 rate was impacted by downtime associated with hurricanes. International R&M International R&M reported earnings of $229 million in 2009 and earnings of $782 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower international refining and marketing margins, lower international marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by positive foreign currency impacts, lower property impairments and lower operating expenses. 45 Table of Contents Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in 2009, compared with 85 percent in 2008. The rate for 2009 reflected higher turnaround activity. In addition, the utilization rate for both periods reflected run reductions in response to market conditions. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 * 2008 * Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 2,503 1,219 (4,839 ) Operating Statistics Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 284 388 389 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 254 295 330 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 189 240 226 *Recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Prior to 2010, our equity earnings for LUKOIL were estimated. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed our accounting to record our equity earnings for LUKOIL on a one-quarter-lag basis. This change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively, by recasting prior period financial information. The performance metrics are also reported on a one-quarter-lag basis. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. In addition to our equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, segment results include the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment, as well as gains from the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. At year-end 2009, we had a 20 percent ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. In July 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL. During 2010, we sold approximately 151 million shares of LUKOIL, and as a result of these sales, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 2.25 percent at December 31, 2010, based on authorized and issued shares. In the third quarter of 2010, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped applying the equity method of accounting for our remaining investment. In addition, we will no longer report proved reserves or production related to our LUKOIL investment. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. In the first quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL. As a result, our first quarter 2011 earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment will primarily reflect the realized gain on share sales. The total unrealized gain on those shares at December 31, 2010, based on a closing price of LUKOIL shares on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share, was $158 million after-tax, and this amount was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 2010 vs. 2009 LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,284 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after-tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold during 2010. 46 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 LUKOIL segment earnings were $1,219 million in 2009, compared with a loss of $4,839 million in 2008. Results for 2008 included a $7,496 million noncash, before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of this impairment, earnings decreased 54 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refined product and crude oil prices, which was partly offset by lower extraction taxes and export tariff rates, and a benefit from basis difference amortization. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 498 248 110 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. Higher operating costs partially offset these increases. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $138 million in 2009 due to lower operating costs and higher margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. These increases were partially offset by lower margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 49 105 106 Other (108 ) (102 ) (76 ) $ (59 ) 3 30 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 47 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3 million in 2009. The decrease for 2010 was mainly due to lower domestic and international power generation results, which resulted from higher operating costs and impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant that was sold in December 2010. Lower margins in international power and higher technology development expenses also contributed to the decrease. 2009 vs. 2008 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $3 million in 2009, compared with $30 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower international power results and higher technology development expenses, which were mostly offset by the absence of an $85 million after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant in 2008. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (965 ) (851 ) (558 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (209 ) (108 ) (202 ) Other (106 ) (51 ) (274 ) $ (1,280 ) (1,010 ) (1,034 ) 2010 vs. 2009 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $101 million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the “Other” category primarily reflect foreign currency transaction losses. 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest increased 53 percent in 2009 as a result of higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2009. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 47 percent due to decreased costs related to compensation plans and overhead. Changes in the “Other” category are primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2009, compared with foreign currency transaction losses in 2008. 48 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,045 12,479 22,658 Short-term debt 936 1,728 370 Total debt 23,592 28,653 27,455 Total equity* 69,109 62,613 56,265 Percent of total debt to capital** 25 % 31 33 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt*** 10 % 9 37 *2009 and 2008 recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. **Capital includes total debt and total equity. ***Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2010, we received $15,372 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, the primary uses of our available cash were: $9,761 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $5,202 million to repay debt, $3,866 million to repurchase common stock, $3,175 million to pay dividends on our common stock, and $982 million to purchase short-term investments. During 2010, cash and cash equivalents increased by $8,912 million to $9,454 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2010, cash of $17,045 million was provided by operating activities, a 37 percent increase from cash from operations of $12,479 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our E&P segment and higher refining margins in our R&M segment. During 2009, cash flow from operations decreased $10,179 million, compared with 2008. The decline was primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices in our E&P segment and lower refining margins in our R&M segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil and natural gas prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Crude oil prices trended higher in 2009 and 2010 although natural gas prices remained weak. Refining margins deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008, remained low throughout 2009, and showed improvement during 2010. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, 49 Table of Contents field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our E&P production for 2010 averaged 1.75 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2011, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.7 million BOE per day. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2011 and future years’ production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2010 was negative 160 percent, including a positive 41 percent from consolidated operations. The 2010 reserve replacement reflects a reduction of 2.2 billion BOE due to LUKOIL share sales and other asset dispositions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the E&P segment’s reserve replacement was 138 percent of 2010 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, our reserve replacement was 75 percent, including 105 percent from consolidated operations; however, excluding LUKOIL, our five-year reserve replacement would have been 111 percent. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, which were more than offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador and the sale of our investment in LUKOIL. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves, while in 2008 revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In our R&M segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2010 were $15.4 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in 2009. The 2010 proceeds from asset sales included $8.3 billion from our interest in LUKOIL. The remaining sales consisted primarily of our interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd., CFJ Properties and North America E&P assets. We plan to raise an additional $3 billion through the end of 2011, as part of our previously announced $10 billion asset disposition program. The sale of our LUKOIL interest is not included in this program. 50 Table of Contents Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2010, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 (QG3) Project. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,182 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2010, compared with $1,300 million at December 31, 2009. Since we had $1,182 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2010. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investor Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2010, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: • Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the 51 Table of Contents ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2010, QG3 had approximately $4 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including the $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. • Rockies Express Pipeline: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. In the second quarter of 2010, the credit facilities were reduced, and our guarantee was released. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2010, was $23.6 billion, a decrease of $5.1 billion during 2010, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 25 percent at year-end 2010, versus 31 percent at the end of 2009. The change in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a combination of a decrease in debt and an increase in equity. Our debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. On February 15, 2011, a $328 million 9.375% Note was repaid at maturity. In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $695 million was short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2010, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $659 million in 2010, is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have provided loan financing to WRB Refining LP, to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. At December 31, 2010, $550 million of such financing was outstanding and $400 million was classified as long term. In February 2011, we announced a 20 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2011, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 22, 2011. On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization totaled 64.5 million shares at a cost of $3.9 billion, through December 31, 2010. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. At year end we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $10.4 billion, a significant portion of which is expected to be directed toward the repurchase of common stock. 52 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2010: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Years Years After Total 1 Year 2-3 4-5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 23,553 924 3,354 3,137 16,138 Capital lease obligations 39 12 4 3 20 Total debt 23,592 936 3,358 3,140 16,158 Interest on debt and other obligations 20,060 1,404 2,649 2,274 13,733 Operating lease obligations 2,896 752 1,033 554 557 Purchase obligations (b) 139,575 61,136 14,326 9,044 55,069 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 5,009 695 1,504 1,672 1,138 Other long-term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,776 454 722 627 6,973 Accrued environmental costs 994 117 176 119 582 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 160 160 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 201,062 65,654 23,768 17,430 94,210 (a) Includes $457 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $73,138 million. In addition, $50,179 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas liquids over the remaining term of 89 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 15 years. Purchase obligations of $12,806 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a seven-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions—for the 2011 through 2015 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $530 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $240 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $730 million for 2011 and then approximately $480 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2011 is expected to be $360 million in the United States and $160 million outside the United States. 53 Table of Contents (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $965 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2011 is $12.8 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $0.4 billion in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 88 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 9 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2011 is approximately $13.5 billion. E&P Capital expenditures and investments for E&P during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, totaled $33.8 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: • Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). • The initial investment in 2008 related to the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) 50/50 joint venture and subsequent expenditures to advance the associated coalbed methane (CBM) projects. • Oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Western North Slope and the Cook Inlet Area; and exploration. • Significant U.S. lease acquisitions in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea offshore Alaska, as well as in the deepwater GOM. 54 Table of Contents • Development drilling and facilities projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area, Alvheim, Heidrun and Statfjord, located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay. • The Kashagan Field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea offshore Kazakhstan. • In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, the development of the Britannia satellite fields, the development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area and development drilling on Clair and in the southern and central North Sea. • Investment in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. • The North Belut Field, as well as other projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • The QG3 Project, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. • The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. • Exploration activities in Australia’s Browse Basin, deepwater GOM, onshore North American shale play and oil sands projects, offshore eastern Canada, North Sea and Kazakhstan’s Block N. • The El Merk Project, comprised of wells, gathering lines and a shared Central Processing Facility to develop the EMK Field Unit in Algeria. 2011 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2011 capital expenditures and investments budget is $11.3 billion, 33 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2010. Thirty-seven percent of E&P’s 2011 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to be directed toward the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk Fields, as well as the Alpine Field and satellites on the Western North Slope. In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development in the Williston, Permian and San Juan Basins, as well as the Eagle Ford, Barnett and Lobo Trends. Also, we expect to direct capital spending towards exploration and appraisal activities in the Eagle Ford shale position in Texas, the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota and the deepwater GOM. E&P is directing $7.1 billion of its 2011 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2011 will be directed to developing major long-term projects including: • Canadian oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in the western Canada gas basins. • Further development of CBM projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region, continued development of Bohai Bay in China, new fields offshore Malaysia, offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia, and offshore Vietnam. • In the North Sea, the Ekofisk Area, Greater Britannia Fields, Southern North Sea assets, development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area and the Clair Ridge Project. • The Kashagan Field in the Caspian Sea. • Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya. • Exploration and appraisal activities in North American shale plays and oil sands projects, Australia’s Browse Basin, Kazakhstan’s Block N, deepwater GOM, offshore Indonesia and the North Sea. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated cost to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. 55 Table of Contents R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $5.1 billion, which represented 13 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Installation of a 20,000-barrel-per-day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. • Installation of a 225-ton per day sulfur plant at the Sweeny Refinery. • Installation of facilities to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the Fluid Catalytic Cracker at the Alliance Refinery. • Completion of a gasoline benzene reduction project at the Borger Refinery. • Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, and associated investment to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. We disposed of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline in 2009. Major construction activities in progress include: • Installation of a 65,000-barrel-per-day coker and a major reconfiguration of the Wood River Refinery to handle advantaged crude and increase capacity, partially funded through long-term advances from ConocoPhillips. • Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at several U.S. refineries to enable production of low benzene gasoline. • U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2011 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2011 capital expenditures and investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 14 percent increase from actual spending in 2010, with about $1 billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance and reliability. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position 56 Table of Contents both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may 57 Table of Contents impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2009, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 65 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2010, we had been notified of seven new sites, re-opened three sites and settled two sites, bringing the number to 73 unresolved sites with potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and 58 Table of Contents amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $928 million in 2010 and are expected to be about $1,100 million per year in 2011 and 2012. Capitalized environmental costs were $574 million in 2010 and are expected to be about $650 million per year in 2011 and 2012. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2010, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $994 million, compared with $1,017 million at December 31, 2009. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. • California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. • Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. 59 Table of Contents • The EPA’s announcement on December 7, 2009, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74, Fed. Reg. 66,495,” finalizing its findings that GHG emissions threaten public health and the environment and that cars and light trucks cause or contribute to this threat. While these findings do not themselves impose any requirements on any industry or company at this time, these findings may lead to greater regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of climate change. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 60 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2010, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,581 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $497 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 58 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2011 would increase by approximately $23 million. The remaining $5,374 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2010 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $118 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2011. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but 61 Table of Contents the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2010, total suspended well costs were $1,013 million, compared with $908 million at year-end 2009. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the statement of operations because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2010, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $56 billion and the depreciation, 62 Table of Contents depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2010 was approximately $7.8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.6 billion BOE at the beginning of 2010 and were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2010 would have increased by an estimated $410 million. Impairments of producing properties resulting from downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance were not material in the last three years. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” and “NMNG” sections of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, 63 Table of Contents expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2010, we had $739 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide E&P reporting unit. At December 31, 2010, we had $3,633 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill, including a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 64 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan. • Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 65 Table of Contents • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Refining, Marketing and Transportation and Commercial monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 66 Table of Contents The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year-end 2010 and 2009 effective yield rate of 2.33 percent and 2.63 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. 67 Table of Contents The average pay rate is comprised of the LIBOR index rate and the swap spread. The swap spread consists primarily of the difference between the 4.60% fixed receive rate and the fixed rates for similar instruments at the time of execution.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2010 or 2009, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2010 2009 2010 2009 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD - 246 $ - (2 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 4 1,664 (3 ) (16 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 562 554 8 34 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 3 744 - (4 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Australian dollar USD - 3 - - Sell euro, buy British pound EUR 253 267 1 (14 ) *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Merger of Conoco and Phillips On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies. Business Environment and Executive Overview ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 35,800 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2004 had assets of $93 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P) —This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a joint venture with Duke Energy Corporation. • Refining and Marketing (R&M) —This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Our investment was 10 percent at December 31, 2004. 43 Table of Contents • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with ChevronTexaco Corporation. • Emerging Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations, including new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products (e.g., gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power generation, and emerging technologies. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including: • Adding to our proved reserve base. We add to our proved reserve base in three primary ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the three years ending December 31, 2004, our reserve replacement exceeded 200 percent, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. The replacement rate was primarily attributable to the merger of Conoco and Phillips, and extensions and discoveries. Improved recovery also positively contributed to our reserve replacement success. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects. • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. During 2004, our worldwide refinery utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 95 percent in 2003. Finally, our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times 44 Table of Contents from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2004 totaled $9.5 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $7.9 billion in 2005. The 2005 amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in LUKOIL. Excluding investments in LUKOIL, we project that 2005 capital expenditures will be higher than 2004 due to ongoing development projects, cost increases and new opportunities. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2004 we substantially completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger. Also during 2004, we acquired a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, a major Russian integrated energy company. • Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can and/or do affect our profitability include: • Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to fair market value. Property impairments in 2004 totaled $164 million, compared with $252 million in 2003. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. • Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year-end 2004 we had $15 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on our profitability. • Tax jurisdictions. As a global company, our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of earnings within our global operations. Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2004, which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2004. Industry crude oil prices were approximately $10 per barrel higher in 2004, versus 2003, averaging $41.42 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate. The increase primarily was due to strong global consumption associated with the robust global economic recovery and particularly strong demand growth in China, as well as oil supply disruptions in Iraq and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to hurricane activity, with little excess OPEC production capacity available to replace lost supplies. Industry U.S. natural gas prices were moderately higher in 2004, versus 2003, 45 Table of Contents averaging approximately $6.13 per thousand cubic feet for Henry Hub. Natural gas prices rose in 2004 due primarily to higher oil prices, continued concerns regarding the adequacy of U.S. natural gas supplies, and hurricane activity disrupting production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At year-end 2004, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated $180 million annual impact on net income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately $50 million for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 30.3 percent equity investment in DEFS. Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in 2004. During 2004, we sold some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets located in the Lower 48 states that are not associated with our E&P operations. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Refining margins in 2004 were improved over 2003, resulting in improved R&M profitability. Industry U.S. refining margins were sharply higher in 2004 versus 2003 due to robust U.S. refined product demand and concerns regarding the adequacy of refined product supplies in the U.S. market in light of tightening gasoline specifications and the ban on methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in New York and Connecticut. Industry U.S. marketing margins declined in 2004 versus 2003, as wholesale and retail prices did not keep pace with rising gasoline and diesel spot market prices, which rose in part as a consequence of the increase in crude oil prices. At year-end 2004, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in worldwide refining margins would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For U.S. marketing margins, the corresponding impact is approximately $100 million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our refineries operated at 94 percent of capacity in 2004, and our goal in 2005 is to operate at an even higher level. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of the year, we acquired additional shares in the open market for an additional $641 million, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 10 percent by year-end 2004. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics industry had been in a cyclical downturn that began in late 2000. In this difficult market environment, CPChem placed great emphasis on safety, cost control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition, CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. During 2004, margins improved in the chemicals and plastics industries, leading to improved results from this segment. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years. 46 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, we had a debt-to-capital ratio of 26 percent, compared with 34 percent at the end of 2003. The decrease was due to a $2.8 billion reduction in debt during 2004, along with increased equity reflecting strong earnings. If market conditions permit, we are targeting to lower our debt-to-capital ratio over the next several years to the low-20-percent range. This should improve our cost of capital and further position us for growth opportunities in the future.

The improved results in 2004 primarily were due to: • Improved refining margins in our R&M segment. • Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream segments. • Improved margins in the Chemicals segment. • Initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results. 47 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income was $4,735 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $295 million in 2002. The improved results in 2003 were primarily due to: • Increased E&P and R&M production volumes as a result of the merger. • Higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P segment. • Improved refining and marketing margins in our R&M segment. • Lower impairments and lease loss accruals related to discontinued operations. • Lower merger-related expenses in 2003, compared with 2002. Income Statement Analysis 2004 vs. 2003 Sales and other operating revenues increased 30 percent in 2004, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 34 percent. These increases mainly were due to: • Higher petroleum products prices. • Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. • Increased volumes of natural gas bought and sold by our commercial organization in its role of optimizing the commodity flows of our E&P segment. • Higher excise, value added and other similar taxes. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 183 percent in 2004. The increase reflects initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: • Our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil prices and higher production volumes. • Our chemicals joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, due to higher volumes and margins. • Our midstream joint venture, Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. • Our joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. • Our joint-venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 9 percent in 2004, primarily due to new fields onstream for a full year for the first time in 2004, including the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea; the Su Tu Den field, offshore Vietnam; and the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea. In addition, foreign currency rates and the Norway Removal Grant Act increased DD&A in 2004. In 2005, we expect DD&A to increase by approximately 15 percent over 2004 levels, reflecting new projects in the E&P segment, including a full year’s production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp-up at the Bayu-Undan field. 48 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense declined 35 percent in 2004. The decrease primarily was due to lower average debt levels during 2004 and an increased amount of interest being capitalized on major capital projects. Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 44 percent, compared with 45 percent for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004, compared with 2003, mainly was due to the impact of a higher proportion of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by reduced benefits from tax rate reductions. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) effective January 1, 2003. As a result, we recognized a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46(R)) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. We recognized a net $95 million charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of these two accounting changes. 2003 vs. 2002 The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003 includes a full year of ConocoPhillips’ operations, while 2002 includes only four months of combined operations. Prior to August 30, 2002, our results reflect Phillips’ operations only. Accordingly, when comparing 2003 with 2002, the merger significantly increased: • Sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold. • Equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates. • Production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger, partially offset by lower merger-related costs in 2003. • Depreciation, depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base. • Taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales, production volumes and property and payroll taxes. • Interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger. In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and distillates. A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in 2003. During 2003, we sold several E&P operations that did not fit into our long-term growth strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million charge for the write-off of in-process research and development costs acquired in the merger. The absence of such a significant charge in the 2003 period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item. Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting accretion expense on environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and discounted obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information. 49 Table of Contents In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in 2003 because of the adoption of FIN 46(R). The adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003, resulted in increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest expense in 2003. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our E&P Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a higher proportion of income in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and the one-time impact of tax law changes in certain international jurisdictions. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write-off of in-process research and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration prospect, both without corresponding tax benefits in 2002. Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring Accruals As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions across regions. The restructuring program was essentially completed during 2004. The information in Note 5—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference. 50 Table of Contents Segment Results E&P 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 1,832 1,445 870 Lower 48 1,110 929 286 United States 2,942 2,374 1,156 International 2,760 1,928 593 $ 5,702 4,302 1,749 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 38.25 28.85 23.83 International 37.18 28.27 25.16 Total consolidated 37.65 28.54 24.39 Equity affiliates* 24.18 19.01 18.41 Worldwide E&P 36.06 27.52 24.08 Natural gas—lease (per thousand cubic feet) United States 5.33 4.67 2.75 International 4.14 3.69 2.79 Total consolidated 4.62 4.08 2.77 Equity affiliates* 2.19 4.44 2.71 Worldwide E&P 4.61 4.08 2.77 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 6.48 5.89 5.66 International 4.31 4.12 3.99 Total consolidated 5.26 4.92 4.94 Equity affiliates* 4.86 4.85 4.38 Worldwide E&P 5.23 4.92 4.92 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 286 301 285 Leasehold impairment 175 133 146 Dry holes 242 167 161 $ 703 601 592 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. 51 Table of Contents 2004 2003 2002 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Crude oil produced Alaska 298 325 331 Lower 48 51 54 40 United States 349 379 371 European North Sea 271 290 196 Asia Pacific 94 61 24 Canada 25 30 13 Other areas 58 72 43 Total consolidated 797 832 647 Equity affiliates* 108 102 35 905 934 682 Natural gas liquids produced Alaska 23 23 24 Lower 48 26 25 8 United States 49 48 32 European North Sea 14 9 8 Asia Pacific 9 - - Canada 10 10 4 Other areas 2 2 2 84 69 46 Millions of Cubic Feet Daily Natural gas produced** Alaska 165 184 175 Lower 48 1,223 1,295 928 United States 1,388 1,479 1,103 European North Sea 1,119 1,215 595 Asia Pacific 301 318 137 Canada 433 435 165 Other areas 71 63 43 Total consolidated 3,312 3,510 2,043 Equity affiliates* 5 12 4 3,317 3,522 2,047 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. ** Represents quantities available for sale.

Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 21 19 8 52 Table of Contents The E&P segment explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2004, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the E&P segment increased 33 percent in 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Increased sales prices were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production, as well as higher exploration expenses and lower net gains on asset dispositions. The 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)), as well as benefits of $233 million from changes in certain international income tax and site restoration laws and equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Included in 2004 is a $72 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change. If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2005 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2004, E&P’s earnings would be negatively impacted in 2005. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices, including estimates of our E&P segment’s sensitivities to crude oil and natural gas prices. Proved reserves at year-end 2004 were 7.61 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.85 billion BOE at year-end 2003. This excludes the estimated 880 million BOE reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 258 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2004, compared with 265 million barrels at year-end 2003. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from the E&P segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the merger; higher crude oil and natural gas prices; and an increased net gain on asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher production and operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other than income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our operations following the merger. In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international E&P operations from changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Also, the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures increased E&P’s net income by $142 million in 2003. ConocoPhillips’ proved reserves at year-end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year-end 2002. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 265 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003, compared with 272 million barrels at year-end 2002. 53 Table of Contents U.S. E&P 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 24 percent in 2004. The increase was mainly the result of higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes and lower net gains on asset dispositions. In addition, the 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)). U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 629,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 7 percent from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. The decreased production primarily was the result of the impact of 2003 asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance activities during 2004. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher crude oil and natural gas prices, higher production volumes, and a net $143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R). U.S. E&P production averaged 674,000 BOE per day in 2003, an increase of 15 percent from 587,000 BOE per day in 2002. The increased production primarily was the result of the merger, as well as increased production from the Borealis satellite field at Kuparuk and from the Alpine field, partially offset by normal field production declines and the impact of asset dispositions. International E&P 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our international E&P operations increased 43 percent in 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher natural gas liquids volumes. Higher prices were partially offset by increased exploration expenses. International E&P production averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000 BOE per day in 2003. This excludes the estimated 38,000 barrels per day reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. Production was favorably impacted in 2004 by the startup of production from the Su Tu Den field in Vietnam in late 2003, the ramp-up of liquids production from the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the startup of the Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela in the fourth quarter of 2004. These items were more than offset by the impact of asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2003. 54 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international E&P operations increased 225 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Increased production volumes following the merger accounted for the majority of the earnings improvement. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase. International E&P’s production averaged 916,000 BOE per day in 2003, compared with 482,000 BOE per day in 2002. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002. The merger was the primary reason for the production increase. International E&P’s net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items: • In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in the second quarter of 2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required the Norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co-venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal costs, as incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal. These changes required us: to recognize an additional liability for the government’s share, prior to repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a corresponding increase in properties, plants and equipment (PP&E); and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets and liabilities. Some of the increases in PP&E were on shut-in fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The overall impact on 2003 results was a net after-tax benefit of $87 million. • In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co-venturers received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan project in the second quarter of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest re-alignment among the co-venturers to proceed, which included our sale of a 10 percent interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the ratification of the Australia/Timor Leste treaty lowered the company’s deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was an after-tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. • In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers. As a result, we recognized a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter. 55 Table of Contents Midstream 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 235 130 55 *Includes DEFS related net income: $ 143 72 23 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 29.38 22.67 19.07 Equity 28.60 22.12 15.92 * Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix. Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Natural gas liquids extracted* 194 215 155 Natural gas liquids fractionated** 205 224 152 * Includes our share of equity affiliates. ** Excludes DEFS. The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 81 percent in 2004. The improvement was primarily attributable to improved results from DEFS, which had: • Higher gross margins, primarily reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. • A $23 million (gross) charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, mainly related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143; partially offset by investment impairments and write-downs of assets held for sale during 2004. Our Midstream operations outside of DEFS had higher earnings in 2004 as well, reflecting the impact of higher natural gas liquids prices that more than offset the effect of asset dispositions in 2004. Included in the Midstream segment’s net income was a benefit of $36 million in 2004, the same as 2003, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 56 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase primarily was attributable to improved results from DEFS and the addition of midstream operations following the merger. DEFS’ results mainly increased because of higher natural gas liquids prices in 2003. In addition, DEFS’ results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance adjustment accruals. Included in the Midstream segment’s 2003 net income was a basis-difference benefit of $36 million, compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 57 Table of Contents R&M 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 2,126 990 138 International 617 282 5 $ 2,743 1,272 143 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 1.33 1.05 .96 Retail 1.52 1.35 1.03 Distillates—wholesale 1.24 .92 .77 *Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2004 and 2002 was 2,160,000 and 2,166,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 428,000 and 440,000 barrels per day, respectively, internationally. 58 Table of Contents The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying and selling crude oil and petroleum products, and transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the R&M segment increased 116 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins. This was partially offset by lower U.S. marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (FIN 46(R)). 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our R&M segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures. U.S. R&M 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 115 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change (FIN 46(R)). Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2004, compared with 96 percent in 2003. The lower capacity utilization was due to increased maintenance downtime. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results mainly were due to significantly higher refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, along with higher utility costs. Our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 96 percent in 2003, compared with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in 2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity, the impact of tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude oil supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability in that country during the quarter. 59 Table of Contents International R&M 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the international R&M operations increased 119 percent in 2004, with the improvement primarily attributable to higher refining margins, partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts on operating costs. Our international crude oil refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2004, compared with 94 percent in 2003. Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, we changed our crude oil capacity utilization statistic at the Humber refinery to make it consistent with our other refineries. This change has been applied to the operating statistics for 2003 and 2002. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international R&M operations increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope of our international refining and marketing operations following the merger, along with higher international refining margins. Included in international R&M’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18 million, compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2003, compared with 83 percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily was the result of the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter due to a power outage and subsequent downtime. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income $ 74 - - Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 38 - - Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 13 - - Net refinery crude processed (thousands of barrels daily) 19 - - *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10 percent. In addition to our estimate of our fourth-quarter weighted-average 8.6 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment also reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL. In addition, this segment will include the costs associated with the employees seconded to LUKOIL. 60 Table of Contents Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our equity earnings and statistics for 2004 from our LUKOIL investment are an estimate, based on market indicators, historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors. Any difference between the estimate and actual results will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period results. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income (Loss) $ 249 7 (14 ) The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of accounting. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased $242 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The improvement reflects that CPChem had improved equity earnings from Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), an olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar, and Saudi Chevron Phillips Company, an aromatics complex in Saudi Arabia. Results from CPChem’s consolidated operations also improved from higher ethylene and benzene margins, as well as increased ethylene, polyethylene and normal alpha olefins sales volumes. 2003 vs. 2002 The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and the downturn continued through 2003. The downturn led to excess production capacity in the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has also been impacted by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Loss Technology solutions $ (18 ) (20 ) (16 ) Gas-to-liquids (33 ) (50 ) (273 ) Power (31 ) (5 ) (3 ) Other (20 ) (24 ) (18 ) $ (102 ) (99 ) (310 ) 61 Table of Contents The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations. These activities include gas-to-liquids (GTL) operations, power generation, technology solutions such as sulfur removal technologies, and emerging technologies, such as renewable fuels and emission management technologies. 2004 vs. 2003 Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $102 million in 2004, compared with a net loss of $99 million in 2003. Contributing to the higher losses in 2004 were lower domestic power margins and higher maintenance costs, as well as increased costs associated with the Immingham power plant project in the United Kingdom, which entered the initial commissioning phase of the project during 2004. Prior to the initial commissioning phase, most costs associated with this project were capitalized as construction costs. This project completed the initial commissioning phase and began commercial operations in October 2004. Partially offsetting these items were lower research and development costs, compared with 2003, which included the costs of a demonstration GTL plant then under construction. Construction of the GTL plant was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2003. 2003 vs. 2002 Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310 million in 2002. The net loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development costs in the third quarter of 2002 related to Conoco’s GTL and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method,” value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before-tax and after-tax basis, because there was no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write-off. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income (Loss) Net interest $ (514 ) (632 ) (412 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (212 ) (173 ) (173 ) Discontinued operations 22 237 (993 ) Merger-related costs (14 ) (223 ) (307 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes - (112 )* - Other (54 ) 26 (33 ) $ (772 ) (877 ) (1,918 ) *Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations. 2004 vs. 2003 After-tax net interest consists of interest and debt expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt and costs associated with the receivables 62 Table of Contents monetization program. Net interest decreased 19 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt levels, an increased amount of interest being capitalized in 2004, lower charges for premiums paid on the early retirement of debt, and lower costs associated with the receivables monetization program. After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased 23 percent in 2004. The increase reflects higher compensation costs, which includes increased stock-based compensation due to an increase in both the number of units issued and higher stock prices in the 2004 period. Discontinued operations net income declined 91 percent in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2003 and 2004. Beginning with the second quarter of 2004, we no longer separately identify merger-related costs because these activities have been substantially completed. The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand-alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were lower in 2004, mainly due to the inclusion in the 2003 period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits, negative foreign currency transaction impacts, higher environmental costs and increased minority interest expense. 2003 vs. 2002 Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and increased premiums on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46(R) at January 1, 2003, increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense. Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On an after-tax basis, merger-related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared with $307 million in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation expenses, transition labor costs, and other charges directly associated with the merger. Results from Other were improved in 2003, compared with 2002, because of higher foreign currency transaction gains and an after-tax gain of $34 million in the first quarter of 2003, representing beneficial interests we had in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those companies from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization. These beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership interests in these insurance companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the mutual companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after-tax, compared with a net gain of $21 million in 2002. 63 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2004 2003 2002 Current ratio 1.0 .8 .9 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,959 9,356 4,978 Total debt repayment obligations due within one year $ 632 1,440 849 Total debt* $ 15,002 17,780 19,766 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust subsidiaries* $ - - 350 Other minority interests $ 1,105 842 651 Common stockholders’ equity $ 42,723 34,366 29,517 Percent of total debt to capital** 26 % 34 39 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 19 % 17 12 * With the adoption of FIN 46(R) effective January 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were removed from our balance sheet and effectively replaced with debt. ** Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders’ equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2004 we raised approximately $1.6 billion in funds from the sale of assets. During 2004, available cash was used to support the company’s ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repay debt and pay dividends. In September 2004, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $.50 per share, which represented a 16 percent increase from the previous quarter’s dividend rate. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2004 were $1.2 billion. During 2004, cash and cash equivalents increased $897 million to $1,387 million. In early 2005, a portion of this cash was used to repay $544 million of commercial paper that had been outstanding at December 31, 2004. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, as well as our $5 billion universal shelf registration statement, to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We anticipate that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2006, including our capital spending program and required debt payments. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2002 through 2004. In addition to favorable market conditions, major acquisitions and mergers played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. The most significant event during this period was the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002. Phillips was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, so 2002 operating cash flows included eight months (January through August) of Phillips’ activity only and four months of ConocoPhillips’ activity (September through December), while 2003 included the first full year of ConocoPhillips’ activity. Absent any other significant acquisitions or mergers during 2005, we expect that market conditions will be the most important factor affecting our 2005 cash flows, when compared with 2004. 64 Table of Contents Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2004 cash of $11,959 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $2,603 million from 2003. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase primarily was driven by higher accounts receivable and a higher retained interest in receivables sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE), partly offset by higher accounts payable. Contributing to the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable were higher sales and purchase prices, respectively. For additional information on income from continuing operations, see the Results of Operations section. For additional information on receivables sold to a QSPE, see Receivables Monetization in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Our cash flows from operating activities for both the short- and long-term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2003 and particularly in 2004, we benefited from high crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as strong refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. In addition, the level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved reserves. We will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of new fields, or by acquisition, and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves. We have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and, although it cannot be assured, anticipate being able to do so in the future. Our barrel-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) production, after adjusting our 2003 production for approximately 60,000 BOE per day for assets sold in 2003 and early 2004, has increased in each of the past three years (2002, 2003 and 2004). Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our production, we expect our 2005 production level to be approximately 4 percent higher than our 2004 level of 1.54 million BOE per day. In 2006, we expect our production level to increase an additional 4 percent over our projected 2005 BOE production level. Beyond 2006, we estimate our BOE production to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 3 percent for the period 2007 through 2010. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp-up in those years and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our proved oil and gas reserves, our reserve replacement over the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, exceeded 200 percent. Contributing to our success during this three-year period were proved reserves added by the merger of Conoco and Phillips, volumes added through extensions and discoveries, and improved recovery. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise and therefore each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2004 and 2002, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2003, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 64 percent, 76 percent and 34 percent of our total net additions in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 65 Table of Contents During these years, we converted, on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at December 31, 2004, we estimate that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be in the 25 percent range. For additional information related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, see the discussion under the E&P section of Capital Spending. The projections and actual results noted above exclude the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL, and the anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks, including reservoir performance; operational downtime; finding and development execution; obtaining management, Board and third-party approval of development projects in a timely manner; regulatory changes; geographical location; market prices; and environmental issues; and therefore, cannot be assured. Asset Sales Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program. Our ultimate target was to raise approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2004. During 2004, proceeds from asset sales were $1.6 billion, bringing total proceeds to approximately $5.0 billion since the program began. While we will continue to have modest asset disposition activity, this asset disposition program was essentially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2004. Proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is a $5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2004, we had $544 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $709 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003. Effective October 12, 2004, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion to replace our previously existing $1.5 billion 364-day facility that was set to expire on October 13, 2004; two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006; and a $500 million facility expiring in October 2008. The two new facilities include a $2.5 billion four-year facility expiring in October 2008 and a $2.5 billion five-year facility expiring in October 2009. Both facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for our $5 billion commercial paper program. In addition, the five-year facility may be used to support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements do contain a cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated subsidiaries’, failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2004. One of our Norwegian subsidiaries had two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expired in June 2004, which were not renewed. 66 Table of Contents Moody’s Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings of A-. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $5 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on our commercial paper balance of $544 million and having issued $173 million of letters of credit at year-end, we had access to $4.3 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2004, which provides liquidity to cover daily operations. In addition, at year-end 2004 our $1.4 billion cash balance and $720 million of remaining capacity related to our receivables monetization program also supported our liquidity position. Shelf Registration In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity securities. As a result, we have available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding $1,105 million of equity held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $504 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts related to controlled-operating joint ventures with minority interest owners. The largest of these, $542 million, was related to the Bayu-Undan liquefied natural gas project in the Timor Sea. During the third quarter of 2004, a $141 million net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was retired. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2004, was 3.34 percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2004, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2004, Ashford held $1.7 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Receivables Factoring At December 31, 2003, we had sold $226 million of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retained servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. At December 31, 2004, we had no receivables outstanding under similar arrangements. See Note 14—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 67 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Monetization At December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a QSPE in a revolving-period securitization arrangement. This arrangement provides for us to sell, and the QSPE to purchase, certain receivables, and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities. All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPE because it meets the requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the QSPE had issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored entities of $480 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and were accounted for accordingly. We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable—related parties, were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables, which gives us certain rights and abilities, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated beneficial interests in the QSPE approximates fair market value due to the very short term of the underlying assets. See Note 14—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Preferred Securities In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust. The sole purpose of the trust was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The trust was established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities. We made interest payments of $29 million in both 2004 and 2003. In addition, we guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. When we redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all the redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 18—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Affiliated Companies As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2004, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. 68 Table of Contents • Hamaca: The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a jointly owned limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2004 were approximately $625 million, expenses were approximately $413 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $324 million. We have a 57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co-venturers in the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17-year-term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14-year-term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $957 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $383 million is recourse to ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings were used to primarily fund a heavy-oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding was provided by capital contributions from the co-venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005), the joint project financings will become non-recourse with respect to the co-venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca project’s cash flows for payment. • Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP): MSLP is a limited partnership in which we and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with PDVSA, were jointly-and-severally liable for under a construction completion guarantee. In May 2004, MSLP achieved completion certification. As a result, the construction completion guarantee related to the debt and bond financing arrangements secured by MSLP expired and the debt became non-recourse to ConocoPhillips and the bondholders can look only to MSLP cash flows for payment. • Other: At December 31, 2004, we had guarantees of approximately $250 million outstanding for our portion of other joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 20 years. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $95 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia. For additional information about guarantees see Note 15—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2004, was $15.0 billion. This reflects debt reductions of approximately $2.8 billion during 2004. The debt reduction primarily resulted from repayment in April of the $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Notes due 2004 at maturity, the redemption in August 2004 of the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.5% Notes due 2005, and a reduction of $165 million in our outstanding commercial paper balance to $544 million at December 31, 2004. The 8.5% Notes were redeemed at a premium of $58 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we have given notice to redeem in March 2005 our $400 milion 3.625% Notes due 2007. Going forward, we have no significant mandatory debt retirements until payment of the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.45% Notes due in 2006, at maturity. 69 Table of Contents On February 4, 2005, we announced a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years. The program will serve as a means of offsetting dilution to shareholders from the company’s stock-based compensation programs. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made at management’s discretion at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan will be held as treasury shares. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2004: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After At December 31, 2004 Total 1 Year 2-3 4-5 5 Years Debt obligations* $ 14,946 625 2,313 1,156 10,852 Capital lease obligations 56 7 15 34 - Total debt 15,002 632 2,328 1,190 10,852 Operating lease obligations 2,813 476 780 548 1,009 Purchase obligations** 67,264 22,131 5,313 4,239 35,581 Other long-term liabilities*** Asset retirement obligations 3,089 112 254 449 2,274 Accrued environmental costs 1,061 144 305 202 410 Total $ 89,229 23,495 8,980 6,628 50,126 * Total debt excluding capital lease obligations. Includes net unamortized premiums and discounts. ** Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $34,880 million, of which $16,243 million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $7,176 million primarily related to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $4,919 million primarily related to natural gas for resale to customers, $3,378 million related to transportation, $1,351 million of futures, $1,284 million related to product purchases and $529 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $27,615 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 96 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co-owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of Petrozuata crude oil for a market-based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 15-year term if a variety of conditions are met. *** Does not include: (1) Taxes—the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production, payroll and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $3,154 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions—for the 2005 through 2009 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $415 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $135 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. Our required minimum funding in 2005 is expected to be $60 million in the United States and $90 million outside the United States; and (3) Interest—we anticipate payments of $894 million in 2005, $1,672 million for the period 2006 through 2007, $1,496 million for the period 2008 through 2009, and $8,259 million for the remaining years to total $12,321 million. 70 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2005 Budget 2004 2003 2002 E&P United States-Alaska $ 751 645 570 706 United States-Lower 48 720 669 848 499 International 4,558 3,935 3,090 2,071 6,029 5,249 4,508 3,276 Midstream 11 7 10 5 R&M United States 1,420 1,026 860 676 International 212 318 319 164 1,632 1,344 1,179 840 LUKOIL Investment* - 2,649 - - Chemicals - - - 60 Emerging Businesses 5 75 284 122 Corporate and Other** 225 172 188 85 $ 7,902 9,496 6,169 4,388 United States $ 3,123 2,520 2,493 2,043 International 4,779 6,976 3,676 2,345 $ 7,902 9,496 6,169 4,388 Discontinued operations $ - 1 224 97 * Discretionary expenditures in 2005 for potential additional equity investment in LUKOIL to increase our ownership percentage up to 20 percent, from 10 percent at December 31, 2004, are not included in our 2005 budget amounts. ** Excludes discontinued operations. Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, totaled $20.1 billion, including $2.6 billion in 2004 relating to our purchase of a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, an international integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Spending was primarily focused on the growth of our E&P segment, with 65 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. Excluding discretionary expenditures for potential additional investment in LUKOIL, our capital budget for 2005 is $7.9 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million to acquire an interest in a joint venture with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. Also included are approximately $345 million in capitalized interest and approximately $145 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export project. We plan to direct approximately 76 percent of our 2005 capital budget to E&P and 21 percent to R&M. E&P Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, totaled $13 billion. The expenditures over the three-year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: • The West Sak and Alpine projects and drilling of National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and satellite field prospects on Alaska’s North Slope. 71 Table of Contents • Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project and development of the Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada. • The Hamaca heavy-oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt. • The Grane field and Ekofisk Area growth project in the Norwegian North Sea. • The Clair, CMS3 and Britannia satellite developments in the United Kingdom. • The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the north Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. • The Bayu-Undan gas recycle and gas development projects in the Timor Sea. • The Belanak, Suban and South Jambi projects in Indonesia. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects. • The Su Tu Den project in Block 15-1 in Vietnam. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the E&P segment. UNITED STATES Alaska During the three year-period ending December 31, 2004, we made capital expenditures for the construction of double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. We expect the fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker will be in Alaska North Slope service in 2006. We continued development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine field and the development of West Sak’s heavy-oil accumulations. In addition, we increased oil production capacity at the Alpine field with the completion of Alpine Capacity Expansion-Phase I and a significant portion of Phase II in the third quarter of 2004. We expect to complete the final component of Phase II in 2005. We also participated in exploratory drilling on the North Slope and we were the successful bidder on 71 tracts covering approximately 484 thousand net acres, at the June 2004 Bureau of Land Management oil and gas lease sale for the Northwest Planning Area of the NPR-A. During 2004, we and our co-venturers in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade the pipeline’s pump stations that is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2005 and anticipated to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2006. Lower 48 States In the Lower 48, we continued to explore or develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, we began production in late 2004 from the Magnolia field, and we sanctioned and began development of the K2 discovery in Green Canyon Block 562 in 2004. Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is pursuing select opportunities in its other producing basins. 72 Table of Contents CANADA In Canada, capital spending in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin continued to focus on development and exploration in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the western edge of our core areas in Alberta, Northeast British Columbia and Southwest Saskatchewan. We continued with development of the Stage III expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is expected to increase our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2 project (the new mine) started up in late-October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected to be fully operational by mid-2006. In 2004, we continued with development of the Surmont heavy-oil project. Over the life of this 30+ year project, we anticipate that approximately 500 production and steam-injection well pairs will be drilled, with our share of the project costs estimated at $1 billion. During 2004, our capital expenditures associated with development of the Surmont project were approximately $33 million. SOUTH AMERICA At our Hamaca project in Venezuela, construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium-grade crude oil became fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2004. NORTHWEST EUROPE In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005; the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea, where production began late in the third quarter of 2003; the U.K. Clair field, where production is expected to begin in early 2005, the CMS3 area, comprising five natural gas fields in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea, where the final field began production in 2004; and the Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2007. AFRICA In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. CASPIAN SEA In 2002, following a discovery well drilled in 2000, we and our co-venturers, and the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the North Caspian Sea to be commercial. In February 2004, the Republic of Kazakhstan approved a development plan for the field and construction activities began. Additional exploratory drilling through 2004 has resulted in the discovery of a total of five fields in the area. In May 2002, we along with the other remaining co-venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of two co-venturers’ rights, which increased our ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. During 2003, we exercised our pre-emptive rights to acquire a proportionate share of B.G. International’s interest in the North Caspian Sea license that includes the Kashagan field. Discussions continue with the Republic of Kazakhstan government to conclude the sale. 73 Table of Contents In the South Caspian, drilling was completed in 2004 on the Zafar-Mashal #1 exploration well in Azerbaijan waters. The well was declared non-commercial and was written off to dry hole expense. ASIA PACIFIC Timor Sea In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with Phase I of the Bayu-Undan gas recycle project, where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed and the dry gas re-injected into the reservoir. Production of liquids began from Phase I in February of 2004. All Phase I development drilling is expected to be complete by April 2005. In June of 2003, we received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority for Phase II, the development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near Darwin, Australia, as well as a gas pipeline from Bayu-Undan to the LNG facility. Construction activities continued through 2004, and the first LNG cargo from the 3.52-million-ton-per-year facility is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. Indonesia In Indonesia, funds were used to construct the Belanak floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility and develop the Belanak field in the South Natuna Sea Block B, where commercial oil production began in late 2004. Also, in Block B we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields, and we began the preliminary engineering phase of the North Belut field development. In South Sumatra, following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement in August, we began the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant. Also in South Sumatra, we completed the construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project in the South Jambi B Block, where first production began in June 2004. China In late-December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19-3 development located on Block 11/05 in China’s Bohai Bay. In late 2004, we approved development plans for the second phase of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25-6 field. In early 2005, the Chinese government also approved the development. The development of Peng Lai 19-3 and Peng Lai 25-6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility. Vietnam In Vietnam’s Block 15-1, the Su Tu Den Phase I southwest area development project was approved in December 2001, and production from this area began in the fourth quarter of 2003. Water injection facilities were put into service in 2004, and preliminary engineering for the nearby Su Tu Vang development began in early 2005. In 2004, we continued the development of the Rang Dong field on Block 15-2, including the development of the central part of the field, where two additional platforms and additional production and injection wells are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005. 2005 Capital Budget E&P’s 2005 capital budget is $6.0 billion, 15 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2004. Twenty-four percent of E&P’s 2005 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 51 percent of that slated for Alaska. 74 Table of Contents We plan to spend $751 million in 2005 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations—including additional work on the Alpine capacity expansion projects, two Alpine satellite and West Sak field developments, construction to complete our fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker, and exploration activities. In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the K2 and Ursa fields and the completion of Magnolia wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. E&P is directing $4.6 billion of its 2005 capital budget to international projects. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million for a 30 percent economic interest in a joint venture with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. Closing on the joint-venture arrangement is expected in the first half of 2005. The majority of the remaining funds will be directed to developing other major long-term projects, including the Bayu-Undan gas development project in the Timor Sea; the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea; the Britannia satellites, Ekofisk Area growth, Alvheim and Saturn projects in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; the Syncrude expansion, Surmont heavy-oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas projects in Canada; the Belanak, Kerisi-Hiu and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL, costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $2,351 million, $2,002 million, and $1,631 million, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Although it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $2,223 million, $1,668 million, and $851 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. Of our 2,232 million BOE proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2004, approximately 82 percent were associated with 12 major developments. Of these 12, three are expected to have an aggregate of approximately 300 million BOE convert from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2005, 2006 and 2007 (with expected year of conversion noted parenthetically) as follows: • Nigeria natural gas reserves (2005). • Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea (natural gas for 2006). • Brodgar field in the United Kingdom (2007). The remaining nine developments are currently producing and are expected to have additional proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded: • The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. • The Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Heidrun and Visund fields in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea. • Indonesia natural gas reserves. 75 Table of Contents • The Prudhoe Bay field on Alaska’s North Slope. • The Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, proved undeveloped reserves added in 2004 for the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan are expected to be converted to proved developed in 2008 with completion of the first phase of the project. R&M Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, and the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending for continuing operations was $3.4 billion, representing 17 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Construction of a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in New Jersey. • Construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S ZorbÔ Sulfur Removal Technology unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. • Expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery. • Capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the Borger, Texas, refinery. • An expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude-oil pipeline. • Integration of certain refinery assets purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery in Illinois. In 2004, we continued to expend funds related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects in the United States, including investing in a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. The new diesel hydrotreater is expected to produce reformulated California highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline. The integration of certain refining assets purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery in Illinois was completed in the second quarter of 2004. Integration of the assets enables the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in Europe and Asia. 2005 Capital Budget R&M’s 2005 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.6 billion, a 21 percent increase over actual spending in 2004. Domestic spending is expected to consume 87 percent of the R&M budget. 76 Table of Contents We plan to direct about $1.3 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, of which approximately 65 percent will go toward domestic clean fuels projects in order to comply with new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our R&M refining business is expected to be $814 million, or approximately 60 percent of the total refining budget. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $143 million, while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October 2004. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. • Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. • Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. 77 Table of Contents • Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the EPA has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in June 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting non-road diesel fuel sulfur content. The non-road rule, as promulgated in June 2004, significantly reduces non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non-road markets. Additional areas of potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. The EPA responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new 8-hour NAAQS on April 30, 2004. Several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule. Depending upon the outcomes of the various challenges, area designations, and the resulting State Implementation Plans, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future ratify, support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions reduction programs. Other countries where we have interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. 78 Table of Contents Because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, it currently is not possible to accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the Kyoto Protocol, but they could be substantial. The Kyoto Protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in February 2005. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2003, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 61 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2004, we had resolved 9 of these sites and had received 12 new notices of potential liability, leaving 64 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 79 Table of Contents Expensed environmental costs were $623 million in 2004 and are expected to be about $610 million in 2005 and $620 million in 2006. Capitalized environmental costs were $652 million in 2004 and are expected to be about $1,096 million and $769 million in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Remediation Accruals We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2004. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2004, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of $1,061 million, compared with $1,119 million at December 31, 2003. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 80 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND EMERGING ISSUES New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” This amendment eliminates the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29 exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. This Statement is effective on a prospective basis beginning July 1, 2005. We continue to evaluate this standard. Also in December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS No. 123(R), which supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the beginning of 2003. SFAS No. 123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and generally requires the fair value of share-based awards to be expensed in the income statement. We are studying the provisions of this new pronouncement to determine the impact, if any, on our financial statements. For more information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This Statement requires that items, such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and re-handling costs, be recognized as current-period charges. We are required to implement this Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are analyzing the provisions of this standard to determine the effects, if any, on our financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement, already effective for contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, was originally intended to become effective July 1, 2003, for all contracts existing at May 31, 2003. However, on November 7, 2003, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. We continue to monitor and assess the FASB’s modifications of SFAS No. 150, but do not anticipate any material impact to our financial statements. Emerging Issues At a November 2004 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) discussed Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which addresses accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same line of business. This draft encompasses our buy/sell transactions described in the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depending on the EITF’s conclusions on this issue, it is possible that we could have to decrease sales and other operating revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $15,492 million, $11,673 million and $4,371 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products on our consolidated income statement. We believe any impact to our income from continuing operations and net income would result from LIFO inventory and would not be material to our financial statements. Additionally, these transactions have no impact on reported volumes for the production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids or refinery throughput and are not a significant component of reported volumes for sales of petroleum products. The FASB is currently reviewing the accounting guidance provided in SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” relating to exploratory costs that have 81 Table of Contents been capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potential economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered. For additional information, see Note 9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2004, the FASB published the Exposure Draft, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” This interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. If the liability’s fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, then the entity must disclose (a) a description of the obligation, (b) the fact that a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, and (c) the reasons why the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. Depending on the FASB’s conclusions on this issue, it is possible that we would need to reconsider our asset retirement obligations and related disclosures for certain of our downstream assets (primarily refineries). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 82 Table of Contents 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. At year-end 2004, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was approximately $604 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was approximately $116 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.7 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, the pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2005, would increase by $11 million. The remaining $2,617 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2004 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells, which management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion is concentrated in nine major projects, of which management expects approximately $500 million to move to proved properties in 2005. See the following discussion of Exploratory Costs for more information on suspended exploratory wells. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether a sufficient quantity of potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Accounting rules require this judgment to be made within one year of well completion in areas not requiring major infrastructure capital expenditures. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas in areas where major infrastructure capital expenditures (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) are required before production can begin, and the economic viability of those capital expenditures depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory drilling work in the area, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory drilling work is under way or firmly planned. In these situations, recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find as a producing well, without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made. Once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed, the economic viability of the overall project, including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made, is evaluated within one year of the last exploratory well completion. If economically viable, internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional drilling work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. 83 Table of Contents Included in total suspended well costs at year-end 2004 was $70 million related to eight exploratory wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned, but for which we are actively pursuing those activities necessary to classify the reserves as proved. These costs were suspended between 1999 and 2003. At year-end 2004, we were awaiting government approval of the development plan for the Bohai Bay Phase II project in China. Suspended well costs associated with this project represented $42 million of the $70 million total. This project was approved by the government in early 2005, which will allow us to book proved reserves in 2005, at which time the suspended well costs will be reclassified as part of the capitalized costs of the project. In addition, suspended amounts at year-end 2004 also included $28 million related to projects where infrastructure decisions are dependent on environmental permitting and production capacity, or where we are continuing to assess reserves and their potential development. During 2004 and 2003, additions to suspended wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned were $7 million and $22 million, respectively. Had these amounts been expensed, they would not have had a material impact on our trend of exploration expenses or our financial statements. At year-end 2004 and 2003, we did not have any amounts suspended that were associated with areas not requiring major capital expenditures before production could begin, where more than one year had elapsed since the completion of drilling. For additional information on suspended wells, see Note 9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s exploration and production (E&P) operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shutdown for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year-end 2004 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2003 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our 10 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas proved reserves at year-end 2004 have been estimated based on the prior year report without any provision for potential 2004 reserve additions and include adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provide for estimated 2004 production. Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves. 84 Table of Contents The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2004, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $29.5 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2004 was approximately $2.6 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 4.7 billion BOE at the beginning of 2004 and were 4.8 billion BOE at the end of 2004. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 265 million barrels at the beginning of 2004 and were 258 million barrels at the end of 2004. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2004 would have been increased by an estimated $174 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $67 million, $225 million and $49 million, respectively. Of these writedowns, only $52 million in 2004, $19 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. The remainder of the impairments resulted either from properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal of the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) that increased asset removal obligations. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 11—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 28—New Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 85 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests, which requires management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 11—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger of Conoco and Phillips, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Within our Exploration and Production segment and our Refining and Marketing segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies’ operations did not overlap in these 86 Table of Contents operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas. In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating segment. In contrast, in our Refining and Marketing operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and Marketing operating segment level. Instead, we identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year-end 2004, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 18 percent to 59 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the $15.0 billion of goodwill. Use of Equity Method Accounting for Investment in LUKOIL In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of LUKOIL from the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we purchased additional shares of LUKOIL on the open market and reached an ownership level of 10 percent in LUKOIL by the end of 2004. On January 24, 2005, LUKOIL held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the LUKOIL Board of Directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in Russia, and certain amendments to LUKOIL’s charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of major stockholders in LUKOIL, such as ConocoPhillips. In addition, during the first quarter of 2005, the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two companies. Significant progress is also being made on advancing the major oil and gas joint venture between the two companies in the Timan-Pechora region of northern Russia, over which we expect to have joint control with LUKOIL. 87 Table of Contents Based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in LUKOIL, we concluded that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL and thus applied the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2004. Determination of whether one company has significant influence over another, the criterion required by APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” in order to use equity method accounting, is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of each situation. Under the equity method of accounting, we estimate and record our weighted-average ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)) each period as equity earnings on our income statement, with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in LUKOIL. Cash dividends received from LUKOIL each period reduce our recorded investment in LUKOIL. The use of equity-method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures in our report. If future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant influence over LUKOIL’s operating and financial policies, we would have to change our accounting classification for the investment to an available-for-sale equity security under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” If that unlikely event were to occur, our investment in LUKOIL would be marked to market each period, based on LUKOIL’s publicly traded share price, with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Additionally, we would no longer record our ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income each period and any cash dividends received would be reported as dividend income when declared by LUKOIL. We also would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded $74 million of equity-method earnings from our 8.6 percent weighted-average ownership level in LUKOIL during the quarter and as of December 31, 2004, supplementally reported an estimated 770 million barrels of crude oil and 661 billion cubic feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of 10 percent at year-end 2004. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, we have used all available information to estimate LUKOIL’s U.S. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 for purposes of our equity-method accounting. Any differences between our estimate and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will be recorded in 2005 equity earnings. In addition, we used all available information to estimate our share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. If, instead of equity-method accounting, we had been required to follow the requirements of SFAS No. 115 for our investment in LUKOIL, the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect LUKOIL’s publicly-traded share price at year-end 2004 would have been a pretax charge against other comprehensive income of approximately $17 million. Also, $19 million of acquisition related costs would have been expensed and $74 million of equity earnings would not have been recorded. At the end of 2004, our cost of investment in LUKOIL shares exceeds our 10 percent share of LUKOIL’s historical U.S. GAAP balance sheet equity by an estimated $659 million. Under the accounting guidelines of APB Opinion No. 18, the basis difference between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of LUKOIL is accounted for as if LUKOIL were a consolidated subsidiary. In other words, a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine how LUKOIL assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical push-down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in LUKOIL’s shares. Once these hypothetical push-down adjustments have been identified, the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference. We have up to one year after a stock purchase to finalize this hypothetical purchase price allocation, but have preliminarily decided to associate the basis difference primarily with LUKOIL’s developed property, plant and equipment base. The earnings we recorded for our LUKOIL investment in the fourth quarter of 2004 thus included a reduction 88 Table of Contents for the amortization of this basis difference. When finalizing this preliminary purchase price allocation in 2005, we will use all available information to make this estimate. Inventory Valuation Our LIFO cost inventories are sensitive to lower-of-cost-or-market impairment write-downs, whenever price levels fall. While crude oil is not the only product in the company’s LIFO pools, its market value is a major factor in lower-of-cost-or-market calculations. We estimate that impairments could occur if a 70 percent/30 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $20.80 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the lower-of-cost-or-market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $105 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $35 million. OUTLOOK E&P’s production for 2005 is expected to be approximately 4 percent higher than the level achieved in 2004. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. For 2005, production increases in Asia Pacific, South America and the United States are expected to offset net declines in the North Sea. In R&M, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during 2005. We expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2005 to average in the upper nineties. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. In January 2005, the Governor of Alaska announced that effective February 1, 2005, most satellite fields surrounding the Prudhoe Bay field would no longer qualify for a state production tax incentive that was intended to encourage development of marginal deposits. Beginning in February, these satellite fields bear the same production tax rate as Prudhoe Bay. This administrative change is anticipated to increase our production tax obligations by approximately $40 million in 2005. 89 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2004, in regards to our Magnolia project in the Gulf of Mexico and on behalf of the Garden Banks 783/784 unit, we filed an application for royalty relief with the Minerals Management Service (MMS). Royalty relief may be granted if the value of the project using the MMS economic model and criteria is insufficient to recover the project investment without the relief. There is no assurance that such relief will be granted. In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 17 percent in February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations. In Libya, we are participating in discussions with our co-venturers and Libyan authorities regarding terms in connection with our anticipated re-entry into that country. In the second quarter of 2004, Norwegian authorities ordered us to modify our facilities at two Ekofisk Area installations—Ekofisk and Eldfisk—and had initially given us until October 1, 2004, to submit a binding plan for implementing measures to ensure workers are not disturbed by noise from other sleeping workers while they are resting. The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority contended we were not in compliance with regulatory requirements for rest and restitution on the installations where there are shared sleeping quarters. We appealed this order and the response deadline was deferred by the Norwegian authorities to December 31, 2004. Concurrently, the Petroleum Safety Authority put the appeal on hold pending further meetings and a letter describing plans that will ensure necessary restitution and rest. On February 3, 2005, we received an official note from the Petroleum Safety Authority stating that our letter of December 28, 2004, presented plans that will meet the intention of their order. Consequently, our appeal will not need to be processed further, and the case is closed. The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities for three anchor fields, including the Parsons Lake field operated by us; compression and gathering pipelines in the Mackenzie Delta area; and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. In September 2004, the National Energy Board in Canada confirmed the Commercial Discovery Declaration (CDD) for the Parsons Lake field. The CDD meets our development planning expectations, which is an important milestone in the regulatory approval process toward obtaining a production license. The main regulatory applications were filed in October 2004, triggering the start of the formal environmental and regulatory review process. This filing sets the stage for regulatory hearings in 2005, leading toward a regulatory decision in 2006. First gas production is currently targeted to commence in the 2009 timeframe. In early July 2004, we announced the finalization of our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Freeport LNG received conditional approval in June 2004 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the facility and received final approval from the FERC in January 2005. Construction began in early 2005, and commercial startup is expected in 2008. We do not have any limited partner ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture. In addition, we have contractual rights to two-thirds of the LNG regasification capacity in the facility, or 1 billion cubic feet per day. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $600 million for the construction of the facility. 90 Table of Contents We are pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals. The Beacon Port Terminal would be located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these projects are in the initial regulatory permitting process. In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas 3, a large-scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies, both of which were advanced in 2004. Qatargas 3 would be an integrated project, jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum and us, consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatar’s North field. The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be responsible for regasification and marketing within the United States. Average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe. In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for an LNG facility to be constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta. The participants formed an incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The FEED contract was awarded to Bechtel in the fourth quarter 2004. These engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in 2006. The LNG facility is targeted to be operational in 2010. In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The Statement of Intent initiates technical and commercial pre-FEED studies and establishes principles for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir-to-market plant. Negotiations on more definitive agreements and progress on the studies continue in 2005. On February 24, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) agreed to terms to restructure their respective ownership levels in DEFS, which would cause DEFS to become a jointly controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. This restructuring has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both owners. We will increase our current 30.3 percent ownership in DEFS to 50 percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of Midstream assets from ConocoPhillips to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ general partner interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P., and a final cash payment to Duke of approximately $200 million, which we expect to fund from our general liquidity resources. We anticipate recording our equity share of the financial gain from DEFS’ sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in the first quarter of 2005. The restructuring is expected to have the effect of significantly reducing the favorable basis difference in our investment in DEFS which, in turn, will significantly reduce the basis difference amortization reported in equity method earnings (see Note 8—Investments and Long-Term Receivables for more information on our basis difference in the DEFS investment). We anticipate that this reduction in basis difference amortization and the loss of earnings from the transfer of certain of our Midstream assets to Duke and DEFS will be approximately offset by our increased 50 percent share of the remaining DEFS earnings going forward. The restructuring is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, subject to normal regulatory approvals. Once completed, our Midstream segment will consist primarily of our 50 percent equity method interest in DEFS. 91 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Changes in our business, operations, results and prospects. • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. • Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing or refining our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG projects and related facilities. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. 92 Table of Contents • General domestic and international economic and political conditions, including armed hostilities and governmental disputes over territorial boundaries. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Inability to obtain economical financing for exploration and development projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 93 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations. 94 Table of Contents We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2004 or 2003, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were as follows: 96 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Foreign Currency Swaps Notional Fair Market Value 2004 2003 2004 2003 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro $ 370 267 13 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound 1,253 789 14 26 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar 85 - 2 - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruny 13 - - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone 15 12 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner 991 380 58 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Polish zlotych 2 - - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona 148 93 3 5 For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 17—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 97 Table of Contents Item 8.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings. Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. /s/ J. J. Mulva /s/ John A. Carrig J. J.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 32,600 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2007 had assets of $178 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. • Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares, and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). • Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 48 Table of Contents Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2007, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 92 percent in 2006. The improved utilization rate reflects less scheduled downtime and unplanned weather-related downtime. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. The acquisition of Burlington Resources in March 2006 added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves, and through our investments in LUKOIL during 2004, 2005 and 2006, we added about 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana). As part of this transaction, we added approximately 400 million barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves in 2007. In the three years ending December 31, 2007, our reserve replacement was 186 percent, including the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, our additional equity investment in LUKOIL, the EnCana business venture, and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs and prudently managing our capital program, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years, and the subsequent increase in industry-wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies are experiencing inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs include rates for drilling rigs, steel and other 49 Table of Contents raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. While we work to manage the effect these inflationary pressures have on our costs, our capital program has been impacted by these factors. The continued weakening of the U.S. dollar has also contributed to higher costs. Our capital program may be further impacted by these factors going forward. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. In January 2007, we entered into two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana to create an integrated North American heavy-oil business, consisting of a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership (FCCL), and a U.S. downstream limited liability company, WRB Refining LLC (WRB). We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. EnCana is obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2007 totaled $11.8 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.3 billion in 2008. In addition to our capital program, we increased shareholder distributions in 2007 through a combination of increased dividends and share repurchases. Our cash dividends totaled $1.64 per share in 2007, an increase of 14 percent over $1.44 per share in 2006. We repurchased $7 billion of our common stock in 2007 and have $10 billion of share repurchase authority remaining through 2008. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2006, we increased our investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 20 percent ownership interest based on issued shares. During 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources. Also during 2006, we announced the commencement of an asset rationalization program to evaluate our asset base to identify those assets that may no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. This program generated proceeds of approximately $3.8 billion through December 31, 2007. In 2008, we expect to complete the disposition of our retail assets in the United States, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. We will evaluate additional opportunities to optimize and strengthen our asset portfolio as the year progresses. • Hiring, developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. In 2007, we hired approximately 2,900 new employees around the world, including university hires as well as experienced hires. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. The ongoing hiring and training of employees is especially important given the significant number of experienced technical personnel potentially exiting the workplace over the next few years. 50 Table of Contents Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. Property impairments in 2007, excluding the impairment of expropriated assets, totaled $442 million, compared with $383 million in 2006. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. • Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year-end 2007 we had $29.3 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $31.5 billion of goodwill at year-end 2006. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative, though non-cash, effect on our profitability. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins improved over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4,588 million before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) impairment (see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The company was also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. Also in October 2007, the Alberta provincial government publicly announced its intention to change the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009 (see the “Outlook” section for additional information on the proposed royalty increase). In January 2008, we and our co-venturers agreed to the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan field, to allow the state-owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008, subject to completion of definitive agreements on dilution and other matters. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 51 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were higher in 2007 compared with 2006, averaging $72.25 per barrel in 2007, an increase of 9 percent. The increase was primarily due to growth in global consumption associated with continuing economic expansions and limited spare capacity from major exporting countries. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub increased during 2007, primarily due to increased demand from the residential and electric power sector. These factors were moderated by higher domestic production, increased LNG imports, and high storage levels. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. During 2005, we increased our ownership interest in DCP Midstream from 30.3 percent to 50 percent, and we recorded a gain of $306 million, after-tax, for our equity share of DCP Midstream’s sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO). DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 19 percent in 2007. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were stronger overall in comparison to 2006. Key factors contributing to the stronger refining margins in 2007 were lower industry refining utilization in the United States and higher distillate and gasoline demand. Wholesale marketing margins in the United States were lower in 2007, compared with those in 2006, as the market did not generally keep pace with the rising cost of crude oil. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares from the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of 2004, all of 2005 and 2006, we invested an additional $5.5 billion, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent by year-end 2006, based on issued shares. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. We initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to Russia’s resource potential, where LUKOIL has significant positions in proved reserves and production. We benefited from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our E&P segment should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in the northern Timan-Pechora province of Russia, and potential opportunities for participation in other developments. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and other items, such as carbon-to-liquids, technology solutions, and alternative energy and programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum-based products, and renewable fuels. Some of these technologies may have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 52 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 4,615 9,848 8,430 Midstream 453 476 688 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 5,923 4,481 4,173 LUKOIL Investment 1,818 1,425 714 Chemicals 359 492 323 Emerging Businesses (8 ) 15 (21 ) Corporate and Other (1,269 ) (1,187 ) (778 ) Net income $ 11,891 15,550 13,529 2007 vs. 2006 The lower results in 2007 were primarily the result of: • The complete impairment ($4,512 million after-tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela resulting from their expropriation in June 2007. • Lower crude oil production in the E&P segment. • Decreased net income from the Chemicals segment, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. • Higher production and operating expenses, higher production taxes, and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the E&P segment. These items were partially offset by: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts in the E&P and R&M segments. • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in the E&P segment. • Higher realized worldwide refining margins, including the benefit of planned inventory reductions in the R&M segment. • Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. 2006 vs. 2005 The improved results in 2006, compared with 2005, were primarily the result of: • Higher crude oil prices in the E&P segment. • The inclusion of Burlington Resources in our results of operations for the E&P segment. • Improved refining margins and volumes and marketing margins in the R&M segment’s U.S. operations. • Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. • The recognition in 2006 of business interruption insurance recoveries attributable to hurricanes in 2005. 53 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: • The impairment of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments. • Lower natural gas prices in the E&P segment. • Higher interest and debt expense resulting from higher average debt levels due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. • Decreased net income from the Midstream segment, reflecting the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Income Statement Analysis 2007 vs. 2006 Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2007. The increase reflects earnings from WRB Refining LLC and FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, our downstream and upstream business ventures with EnCana, formed in January 2007. Also, we had improved results from LUKOIL, reflecting higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from Hamaca and Petrozuata, our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela, primarily due to the expropriation of our interests during the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, CPChem reported lower earnings, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Other income increased 188 percent during 2007, primarily due to: • Higher net gains on asset dispositions associated with asset rationalization efforts. • The release of escrowed funds related to the extinguishment of Hamaca project financing. • The settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. These increases were partially offset by the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. Exploration expenses increased 21 percent during 2007, primarily reflecting the amortization of unproved North American leaseholds obtained in the Burlington Resources acquisition and the impairment of an international exploration license. The increase also reflects higher geological and geophysical expenses and higher dry hole costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 14 percent during 2007, primarily resulting from the addition of Burlington Resources’ assets in the E&P segment’s depreciable asset base for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006. Impairment—expropriated assets reflects a non-cash impairment of $4,588 million before-tax related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela recorded in the second quarter of 2007. For additional information, see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments, which excludes the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela, decreased 35 percent during 2007, primarily due to the significant impairments recorded in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the R&M segment, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. See Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 54 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense increased 15 percent during 2007, primarily due to the interest expense component of the Quality Bank settlements, as well as higher expense associated with the funding requirements for the business venture with EnCana. Foreign currency transaction gains during 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was 49 percent, compared with 45 percent in 2006. The change in the effective rate for 2007 was primarily due to the impact of the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2007. This impact was partially offset by the effect of income tax law changes enacted during 2007, and by a higher proportion of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions during 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and other operating revenues increased 2 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 5 percent. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was primarily due to higher realized prices for crude oil and petroleum products, as well as higher sales volumes associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were mostly offset by decreases associated with the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.” The decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products was primarily the result of the implementation of Issue No. 04-13. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the impact of this Issue on our income statement. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase reflects improved results from: • LUKOIL, resulting from an increase in our ownership percentage, as well as higher estimated crude oil and petroleum products prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOIL’s fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOIL’s reported results. • CPChem, due to higher margins and volumes, as well as the recognition of a business interruption insurance net benefit. These increases were offset partially by the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Other income increased 47 percent during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims. In addition, interest income was higher in 2006, compared with 2005. These increases were partially offset by higher net gains on asset dispositions recorded in 2005. Production and operating expenses increased 22 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to the acquired Burlington Resources assets, increased production at the Bayu-Undan field associated with the Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, the first year of production in Libya, and the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Exploration expenses increased 26 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. DD&A increased 71 percent during 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily the result of the addition of Burlington Resources assets in E&P’s depreciable asset base. In addition, the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery increased DD&A recorded by the R&M segment. 55 Table of Contents Impairments were $683 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005. The increase primarily relates to the impairment in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments. We also recorded an impairment charge in the E&P segment associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. Interest and debt expense increased from $497 million in 2005 to $1,087 million in 2006, primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. Restructuring Program As a result of the acquisition of Burlington Resources, we implemented a restructuring program in March 2006 to capture the synergies of combining the two companies. Under this program, we recorded accruals totaling $230 million in 2006 for employee severance payments, site closings, incremental pension benefit costs associated with the workforce reductions, and employee relocations. Approximately 600 positions were identified for elimination, most of which were in the United States. Of the total accrual, $224 million was reflected in the Burlington Resources purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $6 million ($4 million after-tax) related to ConocoPhillips was reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006. Included in the total accruals of $230 million was $12 million related to pension benefits to be paid in conjunction with other retirement benefits over a number of future years. See Note 6—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 56 Table of Contents Segment Results E&P 2007 2006 2005 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 2,255 2,347 2,552 Lower 48 1,993 2,001 1,736 United States 4,248 4,348 4,288 International 367 5,500 4,142 $ 4,615 9,848 8,430 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 68.00 61.09 51.09 International 70.79 63.38 52.27 Total consolidated 69.47 62.39 51.74 Equity affiliates* 45.31 46.01 37.79 Worldwide E&P 67.11 60.37 49.87 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 5.98 6.11 7.12 International 6.51 6.27 5.78 Total consolidated 6.26 6.20 6.32 Equity affiliates* .30 .30 .26 Worldwide E&P 6.26 6.19 6.30 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 46.00 40.35 40.40 International 48.80 42.89 36.25 Total consolidated 47.13 41.50 38.32 Equity affiliates* - - - Worldwide E&P 47.13 41.50 38.32 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 6.52 5.43 4.24 International 7.68 5.65 4.58 Total consolidated 7.13 5.55 4.43 Equity affiliates* 8.92 5.83 4.93 Worldwide E&P 7.21 5.57 4.47 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment.

Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids shown above. 58 Table of Contents The E&P segment explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2007, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Nigeria, Ecuador, Argentina, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, Algeria, Libya, Vietnam, and Russia. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the E&P segment decreased 53 percent in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a non-cash impairment of $4,588 million before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. The decrease in net income during 2007 reflects this impairment, as well as lower crude oil production, higher production taxes and operating costs, and higher DD&A expense. These decreases were partially offset by: • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. • A net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. • A benefit related to the release of escrowed funds in connection with the extinguishment of the Hamaca project financing. • The Quality Bank settlements. If crude oil prices in 2008 do not remain at the levels experienced in 2007, and if costs continue to increase, the E&P segment’s earnings would be negatively impacted. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices and inflationary cost pressures. Proved reserves at year-end 2007 were 8.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 9.36 billion BOE at year-end 2006. This excludes the estimated 1,838 million BOE and 1,805 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude mining operations, which was 221 million barrels at year-end 2007, compared with 243 million barrels at year-end 2006. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations decreased 2 percent, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska, higher operating costs and DD&A expense, and lower crude oil production. These decreases were mostly offset by: • Higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids production. • The Quality Bank settlements. • Gains on the sale of assets in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2007, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, with retroactive provisions, which results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. E&P production averaged 843,000 BOE per day in 2007, an increase of 4 percent from 808,000 BOE per day in 2006. Production was impacted by the inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007, offset slightly by normal field decline. 59 Table of Contents International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations decreased 93 percent, primarily due to the impairment of expropriated assets in Venezuela, lower crude oil production, higher DD&A expense, and higher operating costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, a net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and the benefit from the release of the escrowed funds related to the Hamaca project. International E&P production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2007, a decrease of 10 percent from 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006. Production was impacted by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil projects, planned and unplanned downtime in Australia and the North Sea, production sharing contract impacts in Australia, our exit from Dubai, and the effect of asset dispositions. These decreases were slightly offset by new production volumes from our upstream business venture with EnCana, as well as inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 23,000 barrels per day in 2007, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the E&P segment increased 17 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher sales prices for natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes, primarily the result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, contributed positively to net income in 2006. These items were partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, the negative impacts of changes in tax laws, and asset impairments. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased slightly in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily resulting from higher crude oil prices, as well as increased crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production in the Lower 48 states, reflecting the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, lower production levels in Alaska, and higher production taxes in Alaska. In August 2006, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, retroactive to April 1, 2006. The new legislation resulted in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 808,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 633,000 barrels per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of volumes from the Burlington Resources assets, offset slightly by decreases in production levels in Alaska. Production in Alaska was negatively impacted by operational shut downs and weather-related transportation delays. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased 33 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, reflecting higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices and production, as well as higher levels of LNG production from the Darwin LNG facility associated with the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea. These increases were offset partially by increased exploration expenses and a $93 million after-tax impairment charge associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. In addition, the increases to net income were partially offset by the net negative impacts of tax law changes in the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Venezuela, and Algeria. 60 Table of Contents During 2006, significant tax legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The United Kingdom increased income tax rates on upstream income, resulting in a negative earnings impact of $470 million to adjust 2006 taxes and restate deferred tax liabilities. In Canada, an overall rate reduction in 2006 resulted in a favorable earnings impact of $401 million to restate deferred tax liabilities. International E&P production averaged 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006, an increase of 24 percent from 910,000 BOE per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of Burlington Resources assets, higher gas production at Bayu-Undan associated with the Darwin LNG ramp-up in Australia, and the 2006 re-entry into Libya. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2005.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 5 percent in 2007, reflecting a shift in natural gas purchase contract terms that are more favorable to natural gas producers. In addition, earnings from DCP Midstream were lower, primarily due to increased operating costs, mainly repairs, maintenance and asset integrity work. The results also reflect a positive tax adjustment included in the 2006 results. These decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. 61 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 31 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the gain from the sale of DCP Midstream’s interest in TEPPCO included in 2005 results. Our net share of this gain was $306 million on an after-tax basis. This decrease was partially offset by a $24 million positive tax adjustment recorded in 2006 to the gain recorded in 2005 on the sale of DCP Midstream’s interest in TEPPCO, as well as higher natural gas liquids prices and an increased ownership interest in DCP Midstream. In July 2005, ConocoPhillips increased its ownership interest in DCP Midstream to 50 percent from 30.3 percent. 62 Table of Contents R&M 2007 2006 2005 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 4,615 3,915 3,329 International 1,308 566 844 $ 5,923 4,481 4,173 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Gasoline Wholesale $ 2.27 2.04 1.73 Retail 2.42 2.18 1.88 Distillates—wholesale 2.29 2.11 1.80 *Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2007, 2006 and 2005, was 2,037,000, 2,208,000, and 2,182,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our domestic refineries, and 669,000, 693,000, and 482,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our international refineries. 63 Table of Contents The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the R&M segment increased 32 percent in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. • Higher realized worldwide refining margins, reflecting in part the impact of planned inventory reductions, including a benefit of $260 million from the liquidation of prior year layers under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. • Higher U.S. Gulf and East Coast refining volumes due to lower planned maintenance and less weather-related downtime. • A $141 million deferred tax benefit related to tax legislation in Germany during the third quarter of 2007. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of assets to WRB Refining LLC (WRB), our downstream business venture with EnCana; foreign currency impacts; and lower marketing sales volumes due to asset sales. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for our view of the factors supporting industry refining and marketing margins. We expect our average worldwide refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2008 to average in the mid-nineties. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2007, primarily due to: • Higher refining volumes at our Gulf and East Coast refineries. • Higher realized refining and marketing margins, due in part to the benefit of planned inventory reductions. These items were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of the Wood River and Borger refineries to WRB, and the impact of business interruption insurance recoveries on our 2006 results. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2007, compared with 92 percent in 2006, primarily reflecting lower planned maintenance and less weather-related downtime. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations increased 131 percent in 2007, due primarily to: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. • The deferred tax benefit related to the tax legislation in Germany. • Higher realized refining margins. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts and lower marketing volumes due to the asset sales. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2007, compared with 91 percent in 2006. The 2007 utilization rate was affected by a temporary idling of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany during the month of August due to economic conditions. 64 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the R&M segment increased 7 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase resulted primarily from: • Higher U.S. refining and marketing margins and higher U.S. refining volumes. • The recognition of a net benefit related to business interruption insurance. • The inclusion of an $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (FIN 47) in the results for 2005. The increase in net income was partially offset by impairments on assets held for sale recognized in 2006, as well as higher depreciation expense. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: • Higher refining and marketing margins, and higher refining volumes. • The recognition of a net $111 million business interruption insurance benefit. • A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in 2005. These items were partially offset by after-tax impairments of $227 million associated with certain assets held for sale, as well as higher depreciation expense. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2006, the same as in 2005, reflecting unplanned weather-related downtime in both years. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations decreased 33 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, due primarily to: • The recognition of a $214 million after-tax impairment charge on certain assets held for sale. • Lower refining margins. • Preliminary engineering costs for certain refinery-related projects. These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange impacts and higher refining and marketing sales volumes. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2006, compared with 99 percent in 2005. The decrease reflected scheduled downtime at certain refineries and unscheduled downtime at the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 65 Table of Contents LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income $ 1,818 1,425 714 Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 401 360 235 Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 256 244 67 Net refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 214 179 122 *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. During 2005, we expended $2,160 million to purchase LUKOIL’s ordinary shares, increasing our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. We expended another $2,715 million to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent at December 31, 2006, based on 851 million issued shares. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity-method accounting, was 20.6 percent at December 31, 2006 and 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 28 percent during 2007, primarily due to higher estimated realized prices, higher estimated volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership. The increase was partially offset by higher estimated taxes and operating costs, as well as the net impact from the alignment of estimated net income to reported results. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated, based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL operating results, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006, recorded in 2007, decreased net income $19 million, compared with a $71 million increase to net income recorded in 2006 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition to our estimate of our equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 100 percent during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of our increased equity ownership, higher estimated prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOIL’s fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOIL’s reported results. 66 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income $ 359 492 323 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 27 percent during 2007, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins and higher turnaround and weather-related repair costs, offset partially by a capital-loss tax benefit of $65 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 52 percent during 2006, compared with 2005. Results for 2006 reflected improved olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes. The results for 2006 also included a hurricane-related business interruption insurance benefit of $20 million after-tax, as well as lower utility costs due to decreased natural gas prices. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 53 82 43 Other (61 ) (67 ) (64 ) $ (8 ) 15 (21 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and other items, such as carbon-to-liquids, technology solutions, and alternative energy and programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum-based products, and renewable fuels. 2007 vs. 2006 The Emerging Businesses segment had a net loss of $8 million in 2007, compared with net income of $15 million in 2006. The decrease reflects lower margins from the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as higher spending associated with alternative energy programs. These decreases were slightly offset by the inclusion of a write-down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant in 2006 results. 67 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 The Emerging Businesses segment had net income of $15 million in 2006, compared with a net loss of $21 million in 2005. The improved results reflect higher international power margins and volumes. The increase in net income was partially offset by the write-down of a damaged gas turbine, as well as lower domestic power margins and volumes. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Loss Net interest $ (820 ) (870 ) (467 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (176 ) (133 ) (183 ) Discontinued operations - - (23 ) Acquisition-related costs (44 ) (98 ) - Other (229 ) (86 ) (105 ) $ (1,269 ) (1,187 ) (778 ) 2007 vs. 2006 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 6 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher amounts of interest being capitalized and higher interest income. These decreases were partially offset by the net impact of the interest components of the Quality Bank settlements and a premium on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 32 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher benefit-related expenses. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were primarily impacted by foreign currency losses in 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net interest increased 86 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. The increases were partially offset by higher amounts of interest being capitalized, as well as higher premiums incurred in 2005 on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 27 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to reduced benefit-related expenses. Acquisition-related costs in 2006 included seismic relicensing and other transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. 68 Table of Contents Results from Other improved during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2006, versus losses in 2005, partially offset by certain tax items not directly attributable to the operating segments. 69 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 24,550 21,516 17,628 Notes payable and long-term debt due within one year 1,398 4,043 1,758 Total debt 21,687 27,134 12,516 Minority interests 1,173 1,202 1,209 Common stockholders’ equity 88,983 82,646 52,731 Percent of total debt to capital* 19 % 24 19 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 25 41 9 *Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders’ equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2007 we raised $3,572 million in proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2007, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repurchase shares of our common stock, repay debt, provide loan financing to certain related parties, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana. During 2007, cash and cash equivalents increased $639 million to $1,456 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our cash balance, commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements, to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We anticipate these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, our share repurchase program, dividend payments, required debt payments, and the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana. For additional information about the EnCana transaction, see Note 16—Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2005 through 2007. Favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. In addition, cash flows in 2007 benefited from the full year inclusion of the operating activity of Burlington Resources, versus only nine months in 2006. Absent any unusual event during 2008, we expect market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2008 operating cash flows. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2007, cash of $24,550 million was provided by operating activities, a 14 percent increase over cash from operations of $21,516 million in 2006. Contributing to the increase was a planned inventory reduction in the 2007 period, partially related to the formation of the WRB downstream business venture; the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition late in the first quarter of 2006; and higher worldwide crude oil prices in 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by the absence of dividends from our Venezuelan operations in 2007. During 2006, cash flow from operations increased $3,888 million to $21,516 million. The improvement, compared with 2005, reflects higher worldwide crude oil prices and U.S. refining margins, higher 70 Table of Contents distributions from equity affiliates, and the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2007 and 2006, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that experienced with commodity prices. After adjusting our production rates for the impact of the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil operations in June 2007, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three years. These increases were driven primarily by acquisitions, including our increased ownership interest in LUKOIL during 2005 and 2006, the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006 and the business venture with EnCana in 2007. Our adjusted 2007 production was approximately 2.25 million BOE per day, after reductions for the expropriation, our exit from Dubai and the sale of non-core assets. We expect 2008 annual production to be similar to the adjusted 2007 amount. Through 2012, we expect our annual production growth rate to average approximately 2 percent. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp-up in those years and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement over the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, was 186 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant factor in replacing our reserves over the past three years, partially offset by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Significant purchases during this three-year period included reserves added in 2007 related to the EnCana business venture, the 2006 acquisition of Burlington Resources and the 2005 re-entry into Libya, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base going forward. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2007 and 2005, revisions increased our reserves, while in 2006, revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the “Capital Spending” section for an analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. 71 Table of Contents In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that experienced with refining margins. In 2006, we received approximately $1.1 billion in distributions from two heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. The majority of these distributions represented operating results from previous years. We did not receive an operating distribution related to these projects in 2007. See the “Outlook” section for additional discussion concerning our operations in Venezuela. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2007 were $3,572 million, compared with $545 million in 2006. The increase is mainly due to ongoing asset rationalization efforts related to the program we announced in April 2006 to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. Through December 31, 2007, this program had generated proceeds of approximately $3.8 billion since inception. In 2008, we expect to complete the disposition of our retail assets in the United States, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In September 2007, we replaced our $5 billion and $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities, with one $7.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. This facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, or as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. The ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, but $41 million in letters of credit had been issued at both dates. Under both commercial paper programs, there was $725 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007, compared with $2,931 million at December 31, 2006. Since we had $725 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $41 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.7 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, Moody’s Investor Service had a rating of “A1” on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of “A.” We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. Shelf Registrations We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 72 Table of Contents We also have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. Minority Interests At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $1,173 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $508 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, $648 million, was related to the Darwin LNG project located in northern Australia. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2007, was 6.55 percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2007, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2007, Ashford held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $29 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2007, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: • Qatargas 3: Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion, excluding accrued interest. Upon completion certification, which is expected in 2010, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non-recourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2007, Qatargas 3 had $2.4 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $690 million, and an additional $43 million of accrued interest. 73 Table of Contents • Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2.0 billion in credit facilities of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), which will be used to construct a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facility is fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2007, Rockies Express had $1,625 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $390 million. In addition, we have a 24 percent guarantee on $600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009 issued by Rockies Express in September 2007. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt non-recourse. For additional information, see Note 7—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Keystone Oil Pipeline: In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in the Keystone Oil Pipeline (Keystone), a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. Keystone plans to construct a crude oil pipeline originating in Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma. In connection with certain planning and construction activities, agreements were put in place with third parties to guarantee the payments due under those agreements. Our maximum potential amount of future payments under those agreements are estimated to be $400 million, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements noted above and the obligation cannot otherwise be mitigated. Payments under the guarantees are contingent upon the partners not making necessary equity contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is considered unlikely that payments would be required. All but $15 million of the guarantees will terminate after construction is completed, currently estimated to be in 2010. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 17—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2007, was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $5.4 billion during 2007, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 19 percent at year-end 2007. Our debt-to-capital ratio at the end of 2008 will depend on realized commodity prices and margins, the funding of our capital program, and the level of our dividends and share repurchases. Our current debt-to-capital target is 20 percent to 25 percent. Effective January 15, 2007, we redeemed the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037, at a premium of $14 million, plus accrued interest. This redemption resulted in the immediate redemption by Phillips 66 Capital II of $350 million of 8% Capital Securities. See Note 15—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also, in January 2007, we redeemed our $153 million 7.25% Notes due 2007 upon their maturity. In February 2007, we reduced our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011 from $5 billion to $4 billion, with a subsequent reduction in July 2007 to $3 billion. In April 2007, we redeemed our $1 billion Floating Rate Notes due 2007 upon their maturity. In October 2007, we redeemed $300 million of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company’s Floating Rate Notes due 2009 at par plus accrued interest. In May 2007, Polar Tankers Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $645 million of 5.951% Notes due 2037. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. In December 2007, we terminated interest rate swaps on $350 million of our 4.75% Notes due 2012. No interest rate swaps remain on any of our debt. 74 Table of Contents In January 2008, we repaid $1 billion of our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011, reducing the balance outstanding to $2 billion. In February 2008, we gave notice to redeem in March 2008 our $300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at 102.7 percent, plus accrued interest. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a ten-year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $593 million is short-term and is included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $425 million in 2007, is presented on our consolidated statement of cash flows as an other financing activity. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as an additional capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the end of 2008. This amount included $2 billion remaining under a previously announced program. During 2007, we repurchased 89.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $7.0 billion, including 177,110 shares at a cost of $14 million from a consolidated Burlington Resources grantor trust. We anticipate first-quarter 2008 share repurchases to be $2 billion to $3 billion. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $690 million in loan financing, and an additional $43 million of accrued interest. See the “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section for additional information on Qatargas 3. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG to provide loan financing of approximately $631 million, excluding accrued interest, for the construction of the facility. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $594 million in loan financing, and an additional $87 million of accrued interest. In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. We estimate our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to be approximately $416 million at current exchange rates, excluding interest to be accrued during construction. This amount will be adjusted as the project’s cost estimate and schedule are updated and the ruble exchange rate fluctuates. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $331 million in loan financing, and an additional $32 million of accrued interest. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the “Loans and advances—related parties” line on the balance sheet. In February 2008, we announced a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share, representing a 15 percent increase over the previous quarter’s dividend of 41 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 3, 2008, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 25, 2008. 75 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2007: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2-3 4-5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,633 1,368 2,796 7,243 10,226 Capital lease obligations 54 30 7 - 17 Total debt 21,687 1,398 2,803 7,243 10,243 Interest on debt and other obligations 15,439 1,429 2,608 1,949 9,453 Operating lease obligations 3,308 732 1,032 737 807 Purchase obligations (b) 125,507 49,929 11,864 8,665 55,049 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 6,887 593 1,285 1,427 3,582 Other long-term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 6,613 253 555 481 5,324 Accrued environmental costs 1,089 187 319 114 469 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 144 144 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 180,674 54,665 20,466 20,616 84,927 (a) Includes $688 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $74,446 million, of which $31,834 million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $10,530 million primarily related to the supply of unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL) to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $9,575 million on futures, $8,933 million primarily related to natural gas for resale customers, $7,354 million related to transportation, $4,984 million related to product purchases, $943 million related to power trades, and $293 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $45,744 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and NGL, from CPChem over the remaining term of 92 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co-venturers in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; and (2) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 12-year term if a variety of conditions are met. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a nine-year period to the upstream joint venture formed with EnCana. (d) Does not include: Pensions—for the 2008 through 2012 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $335 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $200 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, 76 Table of Contents which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $460 million for 2008 and then approximately $300 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2008 is expected to be $110 million in the United States and $120 million outside the United States. (e) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $999 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount is not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

During the three-year period, 67 percent of total spending went to our E&P segment. In addition to our capital expenditures and investments spending during 2007 and 2006, we also provided loans of approximately $700 million and $800 million, respectively, to certain related parties. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2008 is $14.3 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $700 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 77 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 20 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the EnCana transaction, our total capital program for 2008 is approximately $15.3 billion. See the “Capital Requirements” section, as well as Note 10—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 16—Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 77 Table of Contents E&P Capital spending for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, totaled $26.1 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: • Development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including West Sak; the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area; the Alpine field, including satellite field prospects; exploratory drilling; and the acquisition of acreage in Alaska. • Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48 states, including New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota and Colorado. • The Magnolia development, Ursa and K-2 fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • The acquisition of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. • Investment in the West2East Pipeline LLC (West2East), a company holding a 100 percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express). • Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project, the development of the Surmont heavy-oil project, capital expenditures related to the EnCana upstream business venture, and development of conventional oil and gas reserves, all in Canada. • Development of the Corocoro field offshore Venezuela (see Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information). • The Ekofisk Area growth project and Alvheim project in the Norwegian North Sea. • The Statfjord Late-Life project straddling the offshore boundary between Norway and the United Kingdom. • The Britannia satellite and Clair developments in the U.K. North Sea and Atlantic Margin, respectively. • An integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. • Investments in three fields in Algeria. • Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and continued development of these concessions. • Ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields in Nigeria and ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. • The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. • The acquisition of an interest in OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL, and development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. • The Bayu-Undan gas recycle and liquefied natural gas development projects in the Timor Sea and northern Australia, respectively. • The Belanak, Suban, Kerisi, Hiu and Belut projects in Indonesia. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and adjacent field prospects. • Expenditures to develop the Su Tu Vang field and continued in-field development of the Rang Dong field in Vietnam. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pump stations were also included in the E&P segment. 2008 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget is $11.1 billion, 11 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2007. Thirty-nine percent of E&P’s 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. 78 Table of Contents Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and western North Slope operations, including the Alpine satellite fields, as well as exploration activities. In addition, we anticipate further development spending in our Cook Inlet Area. As a result of increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007, we anticipate our 2008 capital expenditures will be less than originally planned, mainly related to reduced project funding on the North Slope of Alaska. In the Lower 48, capital expenditures will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado; the Lobo Trend of south Texas; the Bossier and Cotton Valley Trends of east Texas and north Louisiana; the Barnett Shale Trend of north Texas; the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma; and the Piceance Basin in northwest Colorado. We also plan to pursue oil development in the Williston Basin of Montana and North Dakota, as well as oil and gas developments in southern Louisiana and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Offshore capital will be focused mainly on the Ursa development in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, investments will be made in West2East for Rockies Express. E&P is directing $6.8 billion of its 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2008 will be directed to developing major long-term projects, including the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the YK field in northern Russia, through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL; the J-Block fields, the Britannia satellites and the Ekofisk Area in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; heavy-oil projects in Canada and western Canada natural gas projects; offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia; fields offshore Malaysia and Vietnam; the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar; and the Waha concessions in Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 77 percent, 37 percent and 44 percent of our total net additions in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 16 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,921 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2007, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three-year period ending 2010 will be approximately 18 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $6.4 billion, $6.4 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2008 through 2010 are projected to be $4.5 billion, $3.6 billion, and $2.6 billion, respectively. Approximately 78 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2007 were associated with 10 major development areas and our investment in LUKOIL. Eight of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: • The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. • The Peng Lai 19-3 field in China. • Fields in the United States and Canada. • EnCana business venture projects—Christina Lake and Foster Creek. • The Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada. The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. 79 Table of Contents Midstream Capital spending for Midstream during the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DCP Midstream in 2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. In addition, in December 2007, we invested funds to acquire a 50 percent equity interest in the Keystone Oil Pipeline (Keystone), a joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to U.S. Midwest markets in Illinois and Oklahoma. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $6.1 billion, representing 16 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. • Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale refinery. • A new ultra-low-sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Sweeny refinery. • Revamp of an existing hydrotreater for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and a new hydrogen plant at the Wood River refinery. • Expansion of existing hydrotreaters for both low-sulfur gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel, with the addition of a new hydrogen plant at the Bayway refinery. • A new hydrotreater for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and a hydrogen plant at the Ponca City refinery. • Revamps of existing hydrotreaters for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the Los Angeles, Trainer and Ferndale refineries. • A new ultra-low-sulfur diesel hydrotreater and hydrogen plant at the Billings refinery. • A fluid catalytic cracking gasoline hydrotreater at the Alliance refinery for production of low-sulfur gasoline. • A sulfur removal technology unit at the Lake Charles refinery for the production of low-sulfur gasoline. • A new ultra-low-sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. Major construction activities in progress include: • Expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. • Construction of a low-sulfur gasoline project at the Billings refinery. • U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including upgrading the distillate desulfurization capabilities at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 2008 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2008 capital budget is $2.8 billion, a 102 percent increase from actual spending in 2007. Domestic spending in 2008 is expected to comprise 74 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $1.6 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on reliability, energy efficiency, capital maintenance and regulatory compliance. Work continues at a number of refineries on projects to 80 Table of Contents increase crude oil capacity, expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield. Our North American transportation and marketing businesses are expected to spend about $800 million, including investments in the Keystone project. Outside North America, we plan to spend about $400 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as an upgrade project at the Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery and the advancement of a full-conversion refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, was for continued purchases of ordinary shares of LUKOIL to increase our ownership interest. However, no additional purchases were made in 2007, and none are expected in 2008. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP (SCLP). SCLP provides steam and electric power to the Sweeny refinery complex with any excess power sold into the market. We account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for non-income-tax-related contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. • Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. • Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. 81 Table of Contents • Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. • Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007, which was signed in late December. The new law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to meet these requirements. Since 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, there have been a range of national, sub-national and international regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction. These actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Regulation in this field continues to evolve and while it is likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs. The overall long-term fiscal impact from this type of regulation is uncertain. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme, the program through which many of the European Union member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. • California’s Assembly Bill 32, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. 82 Table of Contents • Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1438 ( 2007) confirming that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the federal Clean Air Act. There is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level in the United States with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and such regulation could result in the creation of substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Additionally, with the continuing trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation and more extensive permitting requirements, our capital and operating environmental expenditures are likely to be substantial and may increase in the future. We may experience significant delays in obtaining all required environmental regulatory permits or other approvals that we need to operate or upgrade our existing facilities or construct new facilities. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, the operation of our facilities may be interrupted or become subject to additional costs. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. Future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2006, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 64 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2007, we had resolved five of these sites and had received nine new notices of potential liability, leaving 68 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint 83 Table of Contents and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,025 million in 2007 and are expected to be about $1.1 billion in 2008 and 2009. Capitalized environmental costs were $785 million in 2007 and are expected to be about $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2007. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2007, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,089 million, compared with $1,062 million at December 31, 2006. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects 84 Table of Contents that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We use fair value measurements to measure, among other items, purchased assets and investments, derivative contracts and financial guarantees. We also use them to assess impairment of properties, plants and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. The Statement does not apply to share-based payment transactions and inventory pricing. In February 2008, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) on Statement No. 157 that permits a one-year delay of the effective date for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We will adopt this Statement effective January 1, 2008, with the exceptions allowed under the FSP described above and do not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements, other than additional disclosures. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” This Statement permits an entity to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial instruments at fair value, with all subsequent changes in fair value for the financial instrument reported in earnings. By electing the fair value option in conjunction with a derivative, an entity can achieve an accounting result similar to a fair value hedge without having to comply with complex hedge accounting rules. We will adopt this Statement effective January 1, 2008, and do not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement will apply to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other businesses. In general, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the disclosure requirements. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting the prior business combination accounting starting January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the changes provided in this Statement. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,” which changes the classification of non-controlling interests, sometimes called a minority interest, in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this Statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent company’s ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation and requires a parent company to recognize a gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This Statement is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively with the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 85 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2007, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,385 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $429 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 65 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.1 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2008 would increase by approximately $29 million. The remaining $4,134 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2007 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion is concentrated in 10 major assets. Management expects less than $50 million to move to proved properties in 2008. Most of the $2 billion is associated with North America and Asia Pacific natural gas projects and North America oil-sands projects, on which we continue to work with co-venturers and regulatory agencies to develop. 86 Table of Contents Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2007, total suspended well costs were $589 million, compared with $537 million at year-end 2006. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 11—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. All of our proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves held by consolidated companies have been estimated by ConocoPhillips. Our policy with respect to equity affiliates is either to estimate the 87 Table of Contents proved reserve quantities ourselves (applicable to those situations where we have a substantial engineering presence), or to rely on estimates prepared by the equity affiliate, and perform a reasonableness review of those assessments. Of the proved reserves attributable to equity affiliates at year-end 2007, 38 percent was based on assessments of the available data performed by ConocoPhillips. The remaining 62 percent, reflecting our equity interest in LUKOIL, was based on estimates prepared by the equity affiliate. These equity-affiliate-prepared estimates are reviewed by ConocoPhillips and adjusted to comply with our internal reserves governance policies. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and sub-surface information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices go up then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2007, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $63 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2007 was approximately $6.9 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 6.4 billion BOE at the beginning of 2007 and were 6.1 billion BOE at the end of 2007. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 243 million barrels at the beginning of 2007 and were 221 million barrels at the end of 2007. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2007 would have been increased by an estimated $361 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $471 million, $215 million and $4 million, respectively. Of these write-downs, $76 million in 2007, $131 million in 2006 and $1 million in 2005 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows 88 Table of Contents used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 14—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 18—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2007, we had $731 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 12—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. At December 31, 2007, we had $29.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units 89 Table of Contents used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Prior to 2007, within our E&P and our R&M segments, we determined we had one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These were Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. In December 2006, we announced a new business strategy for Worldwide Marketing to shift most of our marketing operations to a wholesale channel of trade and significantly increase the level of vertical integration between our refining and wholesale marketing operations. Because of this new business strategy, we plan to dispose of most of the retail outlets we operate or own. During 2007, the execution of this new business strategy was well under way and is expected to be fully in place by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS No. 142), we have reassessed the reporting unit definitions within the R&M segment based on this new business strategy and have concluded that the refining and marketing components within the R&M segment now are economically similar enough to be aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Refining and Marketing, beginning in 2007. No goodwill impairment would have been required in 2007 had we retained Worldwide Marketing as a separate reporting unit. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within our two reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these two reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. When assessing the need for impairments on those sales and disposals, we take into consideration the anticipated allocation of goodwill and provisionally provide for its expected impairment upon final sale or disposal. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income. In addition, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations. At year-end 2007, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production and Worldwide Refining and Marketing reporting units ranged from between 44 percent to 65 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in an impairment. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in 90 Table of Contents determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $100 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $55 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moody’s Aa corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. OUTLOOK Alaska In late 2007, we submitted a proposal to the governor of Alaska to advance the development of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Project. The proposed pipeline would transport approximately 4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Alaska North Slope to markets in Canada and the United States. We have a 36.1 percent non-operator interest in the Greater Prudhoe Area fields that are expected to be a primary source of natural gas to be shipped in the proposed pipeline. Our proposal was submitted as an alternative to the process the Alaska Legislature established in its Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA). In our proposal, we stated our willingness to make significant investments, without state matching funds, to advance this project. In January 2008, we received a letter from the governor of Alaska stating our alternative does not give the state a reason to deviate from the AGIA process. We formally responded to the governor’s letter on January 24, 2008. As a result of the lack of engagement by the state of Alaska on our proposal, we are reassessing how best to advance the Alaska natural gas pipeline project. During this reassessment, as an initial step we will continue planning and contracting efforts in preparation for route reconnaissance and environmental studies starting in June 2008. We expect to continue to testify before the Alaska Legislature and engage the Alaska public with our view of the best path forward to advance the gas pipeline project. Venezuela Negotiations continue between ConocoPhillips and Venezuelan authorities concerning appropriate compensation for the expropriation of the company’s oil interests. We continue to preserve all our rights with respect to this situation, including our rights under the contracts we signed and under international and Venezuelan law. We continue to evaluate our options in realizing adequate compensation for the value of our oil investments and operations in Venezuela and filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was registered by ICSID on December 13, 2007. Canada On October 25, 2007, the Alberta provincial government publicly announced its intention to make a change to the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009. Although the government’s proposed change will require legislative and regulatory amendments to become effective and may be further modified before final adoption, there is a high likelihood there will be some form of change to the royalty structure in Alberta. While the precise impact of the proposed change is not determinable at this time, the adoption of the proposed royalty structure could result in a range of outcomes, including a negative adjustment to our Canadian reserve base. This change will impact both our conventional western Canada natural gas business and our oil sands operations. 91 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG and refinery projects and related facilities. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including: armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation, or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. 92 Table of Contents • Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. • The factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in “Items 1 and 2—Business and Properties” in this report. 93 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those 94 Table of Contents instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS No. 133, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. This hedge was terminated in December 2007, when we sold our positions in the swaps for approximately $3 million. 95 Table of Contents The following table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year-end 2007 effective yield rate of 4.9 percent, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. 96 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2007 or 2006, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Swaps Notional* Fair Market Value** 2007 2006 2007 2006 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 744 242 $ 3 5 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 1,049 647 (16 ) 20 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 1,195 1,367 13 (19 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD - 7 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 20 17 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 779 1,145 15 15 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 11 108 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Slovakia koruna USD - 2 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Hungary forint USD - 4 - - Sell euro, buy Norwegian kroner EUR - 10 - - Sell euro, buy Canadian dollar EUR 58 - - - Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 1 125 3 - *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings. Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. /s/ James J. Mulva /s/ John A. Carrig James J. Mulva John A.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Merger of Conoco and Phillips On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies. Business Environment and Executive Summary Our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our Exploration and Production (E&P) and Refining and Marketing (R&M) segments. Our earnings normally are less impacted by results from the Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our profitability. These prices and margins are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations. Consistently high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. Finally, our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship. 39 Table of Contents • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a top priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, as such, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital spending in 2003 totaled $6.2 billion, and we anticipate capital spending to be approximately $6.9 billion in 2004. • Evaluating our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. • Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Many of our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of our operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. We also use the “return on capital employed” measure. Other significant factors that can and/or do affect our profitability include: • Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to fair market value. Also, at times we invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. • Goodwill. As a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on the company’s profitability. • Tax jurisdictions. As a global company, our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of earnings within our global operations. 40 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2003, which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2003. For a discussion of factors impacting crude oil and natural gas prices in 2003, as well as our view of the potential movement of these prices into 2004, see the “Outlook” section. At year-end 2003, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated $170 million annual impact on net income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately $40 million for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS). Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in 2003. In early 2004, we approved the disposal of some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets located in the Lower 48 states that are not associated with our E&P operations. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Refining margins in 2003 were much improved over 2002, resulting in improved R&M profitability. See the “Outlook” section for further discussion of refining margins in 2003 and our view of their potential movement into 2004. At year-end 2003, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in refining margins would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For wholesale marketing margins, the corresponding impact is approximately $100 million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our refineries operated at 94 percent of rated capacity in 2003, and our goal in 2004 is to operate at about the same level. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the last several years. In this difficult market environment, CPChem has placed great emphasis on safety, cost control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition, CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. With its low cost structure, we feel CPChem is well positioned to benefit from improved margins when the chemicals industry emerges from its downturn. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years. At December 31, 2003, we had a debt-to-capital ratio of 34 percent. We have made a priority of using funds available after paying dividends and capital spending to reduce debt. We reduced our debt by $4.8 billion in 2003. We feel that by lowering our debt-to-capital ratio over the next several years to about 30 percent, we can improve our cost of capital and further position ourselves for growth opportunities in the future. 41 Table of Contents Consolidated Results Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Income from continuing operations $ 4,593 698 1,601 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 237 (993 ) 32 Cumulative effect of accounting changes (95 )* — 28 Net income (loss) $ 4,735 (295 ) 1,661 * Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations.

The improved results in 2003 were primarily due to: • Increased E&P and R&M production volumes as a result of the merger; • Higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P segment; • Improved refining and marketing margins in our R&M segment; • Lower impairments and lease loss accruals related to discontinued operations; and • Lower merger-related expenses in 2003, compared with 2002. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our E&P and R&M results, as well as our other reporting segments. 2002 vs. 2001 We incurred a net loss of $295 million in 2002, compared with net income of $1,661 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to recognizing impairments and loss accruals totaling $1,077 million after-tax associated with our retail and wholesale marketing operations that were classified as discontinued operations in late 2002, as well as merger-related costs totaling $557 million after-tax. Also negatively impacting results for 2002 were other asset impairments totaling $192 million after-tax, lower refining 42 Table of Contents margins, lower natural gas sales prices, decreased equity earnings from Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), and higher interest expense. These factors were partially offset by improved results from Chemicals and higher production volumes in E&P after the merger. Income Statement Analysis 2003 vs. 2002 The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003 includes a full year of ConocoPhillips’ operations, while 2002 includes only four months of combined operations. Prior to August 30, 2002, our results reflect Phillips’ operations only. Accordingly, the merger significantly increased: • Sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold; • Equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates; • Production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger, partially offset by lower merger-related costs in 2003; • Depreciation, depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base; • Taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales, production volumes and property and payroll taxes; and • Interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger. In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and distillates. These are commodity products and their price levels are determined by market factors. Our share of earnings from affiliates acquired in the merger accounted for the majority of the increase in the equity earnings. Of these, the E&P joint ventures in Canada (Petrovera) and Venezuela (Petrozuata), along with CFJ Properties in our R&M segment, provided the largest equity earnings. On February 18, 2004, we sold our interest in the Petrovera joint venture. Of the equity affiliates held prior to the merger, our equity earnings from DEFS improved on higher natural gas liquids prices, and our earnings from Hamaca, an E&P heavy-oil joint venture in Venezuela, increased due to higher crude oil production. A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in 2003. During 2003 we sold several E&P operations that did not fit into our long-term growth strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits. See the Corporate and Other section of “Segment Results” for additional information on these insurance benefits. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million charge for the write-off of in-process research and development costs acquired in the merger. The absence of such a significant charge in the 2003 period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item. Property impairments increased by $75 million in 2003, compared with 2002. The 2003 impairments were recorded as a result of asset status changes from held-for-use to held-for-sale, producing properties that failed to meet recoverability tests, and tax law changes in Norway affecting asset removal costs. During 2002, property impairments were triggered by asset dispositions and the impairment of tradenames. See Note 12—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information. 43 Table of Contents Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting accretion expense on environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and discounted obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information on SFAS No. 143. In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in 2003 because of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46). The adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003, resulted in increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest expense in 2003. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, and Note 14 – Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our E&P Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 7—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a higher proportion of income in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and the one-time impact of tax law changes in certain international jurisdictions. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write-off of in-process research and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration prospect, both without corresponding tax benefits in 2002. Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003, resulting in the recognition of a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Together, these resulted in a net charge of $95 million. For additional information on these accounting changes, see Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2002 vs. 2001 In addition to the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, ConocoPhillips closed on the $7 billion acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001. Together, these transactions significantly increased operating revenues; equity earnings; other income; purchase costs; operating expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; taxes other than income taxes; accretion on discounted liabilities; and interest and debt expense in 2002, compared with 2001. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring Accruals As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions across regions. We expect the restructuring program to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. From September 2002 through December 31, 2003, approximately 3,900 positions worldwide had been identified for elimination. Of this total, approximately 3,000 employees had been terminated by December 31, 2003. The information in Note 5—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.

Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 19 8 — 46 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 The E&P segment explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2003, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Lesté in the Timor Sea, offshore Australia, offshore China, offshore the United Arab Emirates, offshore Vietnam, Russia, and Indonesia. Net income from the E&P segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the merger; higher crude oil and natural gas prices; and an increased net gain on asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher production and operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other than income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our operations following the merger. In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international E&P operations from changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Also, the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures increased E&P’s net income by $142 million in 2003. Our average worldwide crude oil sales price was $27.47 per barrel in 2003, compared with $24.07 in 2002. We also benefited from higher natural gas prices in 2003, with our average worldwide price increasing from $2.77 per thousand cubic feet in 2002 to $4.07 in 2003. If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2004 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2003, E&P’s earnings will be negatively impacted in 2004. See the “Outlook” section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices. ConocoPhillips’ proved reserves at year-end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year-end 2002. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 265 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003, compared with 272 million barrels at year-end 2002. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the E&P segment increased 3 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. Although E&P benefited from four months of increased production volumes in 2002 following the merger, this increase was mostly offset by lower natural gas sales prices, higher exploration expenses, and the unfavorable $24 million impact of a tax law change in the United Kingdom. Our average worldwide crude oil sales price was $24.07 per barrel in 2002, a 1 percent increase over $23.74 in 2001. Our average worldwide natural gas price in 2002 was $2.77 per thousand cubic feet, a 14 percent decrease from $3.23 in 2001. Our proved reserves at year-end 2002 were 7.81 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 52 percent increase over year-end 2001’s 5.13 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The increase was attributable to the merger. 47 Table of Contents U.S. E&P 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Net income from our Alaskan operations increased $575 million in 2003. The improvement in Alaska reflects higher crude oil prices, and a net $143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46, partially offset by slightly lower crude oil production volumes. The West Coast price of our Alaskan crude oil production increased 22 percent in 2003, from $23.75 per barrel in 2002 to $28.87 per barrel in 2003. Normal field declines and some operating interruptions in 2003 were mostly offset by increased production from the Borealis satellite field, the new Kuparuk Palm drill site, and Alpine, which enabled us to experience only a slight decrease in our Alaska crude oil production rate in 2003. Our E&P Lower 48 net income increased $643 million in 2003, primarily because of increased natural gas production and sales prices, as well as, to a lesser extent, higher crude oil production and prices. U.S. Lower 48 natural gas prices increased 71 percent in 2003. Our increased production volumes in the Lower 48 mainly were the result of the merger, partially offset by the impact of asset dispositions. We continued our Lower 48/Gulf of Mexico asset rationalization program in 2003, which resulted in the sale of properties that did not fit into our long-term growth strategy. As planned, we are exiting the shallow water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 operations recognized a net $1 million charge from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46 effective January 1, 2003. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from U.S. E&P operations decreased 14 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. Although net income for 2002 benefited from four months of increased production volumes following the merger, this increase was more than offset by lower natural gas prices, lower production volumes in Alaska, and higher dry hole costs. Our U.S. average natural gas price in 2002 was 23 percent lower than in 2001. Our U.S. crude oil production decreased slightly in 2002, while natural gas production increased 20 percent. The increase in natural gas production was mainly due to four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. The merger impact on total crude oil production was offset by lower production in Alaska, which experienced normal field declines, along with operating interruptions at the Prudhoe Bay field. International E&P 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international E&P operations increased 225 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Increased production volumes following the merger accounted for the majority of the earnings improvement. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase. International E&P’s production on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent basis averaged 916,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 482,000 barrels per day in 2002. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002. Although the merger was the primary reason for the production increase, other items impacting our production rate in 2003 were: 48 Table of Contents • The startup of the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea in September 2003; • A full year’s production from Phase I of the development of the Peng Lai 19-3 field in China’s Bohai Bay; and • The startup of production from the Phase I development of the Su Tu Den project in Vietnam late in the fourth quarter of 2003. Included in international E&P’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction loss of $50 million, compared with a net loss of $34 million in 2002. International E&P’s net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items: • In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in the second quarter of 2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required the Norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co-venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal costs, as incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal. These changes required us: to recognize an additional liability for the government’s share, prior to repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a corresponding increase in properties, plants and equipment (PP&E); and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets and liabilities. Some of the increases in PP&E were on shut-in fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The overall impact on 2003 results was a net after-tax benefit of $87 million. • In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co-venturers received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan project in the second quarter of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest re-alignment among the co-venturers to proceed, which included our sale of a 10 percent interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the ratification of the Australia/Timor Lesté treaty lowered the company’s deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was an after-tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 7—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. • In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers. As a result we recognized a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from international E&P operations increased 66 percent in 2002. The improvement reflects four months of increased production volumes following the merger. However, 2002 net income included a $24 million deferred tax charge related to tax law changes in the United Kingdom. Net income in 2002 also included a $77 million leasehold impairment of deepwater Block 34, offshore Angola, due to an unsuccessful exploratory well in the block, along with higher dry hole charges. Our international crude oil production increased 64 percent in 2002, while natural gas production increased 126 percent. The increases were mainly due to the addition of four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. 49 Table of Contents Midstream 2003 2002 2001 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 130 55 120 *Includes DEFS related net income: $ 72 23 101 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 22.67 19.07 — Equity 22.12 15.92 18.77 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Natural gas liquids extracted** 219 156 120 Natural gas liquids fractionated 167 133 108 * Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix. ** Includes our share of equity affiliates. 2003 vs. 2002 The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. Our Midstream segment consists of a 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase primarily was attributable to improved results from DEFS and the addition of midstream operations following the merger. DEFS’ results mainly increased because of higher natural gas liquids prices in 2003. In addition, DEFS’ results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance adjustment accruals. Included in the Midstream segment’s 2003 net income was a basis-difference benefit of $36 million, compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 54 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from DEFS, which experienced a decline in natural gas liquids prices, increased costs for gas imbalance accruals and other adjustments, and higher operating expenses. 50 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by the benefit of four months’ results from operations acquired in the merger. Included in the Midstream segment’s net income in 2002 was a benefit of $35 million, representing the amortization of the basis difference between the book value of ConocoPhillips’ contribution to DEFS and our 30.3 percent equity interest in DEFS. The corresponding amount for 2001 was $36 million. 51 Table of Contents R&M 2003 2002 2001 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 990 138 395 International 282 5 2 $ 1,272 143 397 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 1.05 .96 .83 Retail 1.35 1.03 1.01 Distillates—wholesale .92 .77 .78 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2002 and 2001 was 2,166,000 and 1,656,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 440,000 and 72,000 barrels per day, respectively, internationally. 52 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying and selling crude oil and refined products, and transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. Net income from our R&M segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures. Our refineries produced 2.7 million barrels per day of petroleum products in 2003, compared with 2.0 million barrels per day in 2002. The increase reflects the addition of production from refineries acquired in the merger. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the R&M segment declined 64 percent in 2002, compared with 2001, reflecting lower refining margins, along with an $84 million after-tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. R&M earnings for 2002 included four months’ results from operations acquired in the merger, as well as the impact of a full year’s results from Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only the last three and one-half months of 2001. Worldwide crude oil refining capacity utilization was 90 percent in 2002, compared with 94 percent in 2001. Our refineries produced 2.0 million barrels per day of petroleum products in 2002, compared with 814,000 barrels per day in 2001. The increase reflects a full year of operations for refineries acquired in the Tosco acquisition and four months of operations for the refineries acquired in the merger. U.S. R&M 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results mainly were due to significantly higher refining margins, particularly during the third quarter of 2003. Industry U.S. refining margins were strong in the third quarter of 2003 due to increased gasoline demand in August and an unusual number of refined product supply disruptions, including refinery outages in the Midwest caused by a major power blackout in August 2003. See the “Outlook” section for additional discussion of refining margins. We capitalized on the strong refining margins in the third quarter by running our U.S. refineries at a utilization rate of 96 percent during the quarter. However, this rate was negatively impacted by a fire at our Ponca City, Oklahoma, refinery during July that resulted in portions of the facility being shut down. The Ponca City refinery’s throughput was restored in the fourth quarter of 2003 to levels achieved before the fire. 53 Table of Contents The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, along with higher utility costs. For the full year of 2003, our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 96 percent, compared with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in 2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity, the impact of tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude oil supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability in that country during the quarter. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from U.S. R&M operations declined 65 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins, particularly in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, along with an $84 million after-tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. These items were partially offset by increased production and sales volumes as a result of the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Net income for 2002 included four months of operations acquired in the merger, and a full year of Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only three and one-half months. Effective January 1, 2001, we changed our method of accounting for the costs of major maintenance turnarounds from the accrue-in-advance method to the expense-as-incurred method. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle increased R&M net income by $26 million. Also included in 2001 was a $27 million write-down of inventories to market value. International R&M 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international R&M operations increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope of our international refining and marketing operations following the merger, along with higher international refining margins. Prior to the merger, our international R&M operations consisted only of our Whitegate refinery in Ireland with a rated crude oil capacity of 72,000 barrels per day. The merger added one wholly owned and four joint-venture refineries, with a rated crude oil capacity of 370,000 barrels per day. In addition, the merger added an extensive marketing network throughout Europe and Asia. Included in international R&M’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18 million, compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2003, compared with 78 percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily was the result of the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter due to a power outage and subsequent downtime. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from international R&M operations increased $3 million in 2002, compared with 2001, reflecting the impact of the merger. The Humber refinery was shut down for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter of 2002, which negatively impacted international R&M’s 2002 results. 54 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net Income (Loss) $ 7 (14 ) (128 ) 2003 vs. 2002 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of accounting. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane. As the results in both years indicate, the chemicals industry continues to be challenged to effectively utilize capacity, manage costs and improve margins in a difficult economic environment. The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and the downturn continued through 2003. The downturn has led to excess production capacity in the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has also been impacted by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs. 2002 vs. 2001 The Chemicals segment incurred a net loss of $14 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $128 million in 2001. Higher margins in 2002 contributed to the improvement in results. Lower operating expenses, feedstock costs and energy prices in 2002 were partially offset by decreased sales prices. Due to depressed economic conditions in the chemicals industry, asset retirements and impairments totaling $84 million after-tax were recognized by CPChem in 2001. A developmental reactor at the Pasadena Plastics Complex in Pasadena, Texas, was retired; accelerated depreciation was recognized by CPChem on two polyethylene reactors at the Orange chemical plant in Orange, Texas; an ethylene unit was retired at the Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas; an equity affiliate of CPChem recorded a property impairment related to a polypropylene facility; property impairments were taken on the manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico; and the benzene and cyclohexane units at the Puerto Rico facility were retired. In addition, the valuation allowance on the Puerto Rico facility’s deferred tax asset related to its net operating losses was increased in 2001 so that the deferred tax assets were fully offset by valuation allowances. Partially offsetting these impairments and retirements was a business interruption insurance settlement recognized by CPChem, and a favorable deferred tax adjustment recorded by ConocoPhillips related to the Puerto Rico facility, together totaling $57 million after-tax. 55 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net Loss Technology solutions $ (20 ) (16 ) (12 ) Gas-to-liquids (50 ) (273 ) — Power (5 ) (3 ) — Other (24 ) (18 ) — $ (99 ) (310 ) (12 ) 2003 vs. 2002 The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations. Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310 million in 2002. The net loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development costs in the third quarter of 2002 related to Conoco’s natural gas-to-liquids and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method,” value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before-tax and after-tax basis, because there was no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write-off. 2002 vs. 2001 The Emerging Businesses segment posted a net loss of $310 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $12 million in 2001. Results for 2002 included a $246 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs described above. The increased number of developing businesses after the merger also contributed to the larger losses in 2002. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net Loss Net interest $ (632 ) (412 ) (262 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (173 ) (173 ) (114 ) Discontinued operations 237 (993 ) 32 Merger-related costs (223 ) (307 ) — Cumulative effect of accounting changes (112 )* — — Other 26 (33 ) (71 ) $ (877 ) (1,918 ) (415 ) * Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations. 56 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net interest after-tax represents interest expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and increased premiums on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46 at January 1, 2003, increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses were the same in 2003 as in 2002. Expenses in 2003 were impacted by the merger, as well as the expensing of stock options. Beginning in 2003, on a prospective basis, we elected to use the fair-value accounting method provided for under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Offsetting these items were increased allocations of certain staff costs to the operating segments in 2003. The increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments’ results. Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On an after-tax basis, merger-related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared with $307 million in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation expenses, transition labor costs, and other charges directly associated with the merger. The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand-alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were improved in 2003 because of higher foreign currency transaction gains and an after-tax gain of $34 million in the first quarter of 2003, representing beneficial interests we had in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those companies from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization. These beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership interests in these insurance companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the mutual companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after-tax, compared with a net gain of $21 million in 2002. 2002 vs. 2001 Corporate and Other’s net loss was $1,918 million in 2002, compared with $415 million in 2001. The increased net loss in 2002 reflects losses from discontinued operations, primarily due to impairments, and merger-related costs. Net interest expense and corporate general and administrative costs were also higher in 2002 due to the merger. 57 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2003 2002 2001 Current ratio .8 .9 1.3 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,356 4,978 3,559 Total debt repayment obligations due within one year $ 1,440 849 44 Total debt* $ 17,780 19,766 8,654 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust subsidiaries* $ — 350 650 Other minority interests $ 842 651 5 Common stockholders’ equity $ 34,366 29,517 14,340 Percent of total debt to capital** 34 % 39 37 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 17 % 12 20 * With the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” effective January 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were removed from our balance sheet and effectively replaced with debt. ** Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders’ equity. To meet our liquidity requirements, including funding our capital program, paying dividends and repaying debt, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. During 2003, available cash was used to support the company’s ongoing capital expenditures program, repay debt and pay dividends. In October 2003, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a dividend of $.43 per share, payable December 1, 2003, which represented a 7.5 percent increase from the previous quarter’s dividend rate. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2003 was $1.1 billion. During 2003, cash and cash equivalents increased $183 million to $490 million. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2003, cash of $9,356 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $4,378 million from 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: • Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; • Increased production as a result of the inclusion of Conoco activity for the full year; and • Higher refining and marketing margins. In addition, working capital changes increased cash flow from operating activities $589 million in 2003, compared with an increase of $982 million in 2002. Cash from operating activities provided by discontinued operations amounted to $189 million, compared with $202 million in 2002. Asset Sales Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program to sell approximately $3 billion to $4 billion of assets by the end of 2004. Through year-end 2003, we had sold approximately $3.4 billion of assets and raised our target to $4.5 billion by year-end 2004. In February 2004, we sold our 46.7 percent interest in Petrovera Resources Limited, which primarily produced conventional heavy oil in Western Canada. Additional assets expected to be sold in 2004 are primarily related to our marketing 58 Table of Contents business. In addition, we are proceeding with plans to dispose of some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets. During 2003, $2.7 billion was received from the sale of various assets, including the remaining assets required to be sold by the Federal Trade Commission as a result of the merger, a substantial portion of our U.S. retail marketing sites, and non-strategic E&P properties. Proceeds from these asset sales have been, and will be, used primarily to pay off debt. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is a $4 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2003, we had $709 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $1,517 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002, of which $206 million was denominated in foreign currencies. Effective October 14, 2003, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities to replace our previously existing $2 billion 364-day facility that expired on that same date. The new revolving credit facilities consist of a $1.5 billion 364-day facility and a $500 million five-year facility. We also have two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2003. These credit facilities support the company’s $4 billion commercial paper program. In addition, one of our Norwegian subsidiaries has two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expire in June 2004, under which no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2003. Moody’s Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings of A-. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $4.6 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on our year-end commercial paper balance of $709 million, we had access to $3.9 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2003, which provides ample liquidity to cover daily operations. Shelf Registration In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity securities. As a result, we have available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding $842 million of equity held by minority interest owners, including a net minority interest of $496 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. and a $141 million net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. • In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2003, was 2.48 percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to 59 Table of Contents remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2003, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2003, Ashford held $1.6 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. • In 1999, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco formed Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P., contributing an office building and four aircraft to the partnership. Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. is a limited-life entity that must be liquidated in 2019. The limited partner interest was sold to Highlander Investors L.L.C. for $141 million, which represented an initial net 47 percent interest. Highlander’s current investment in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. is 24.4 percent. Highlander is entitled to a cumulative annual priority return on its investment of 7.86 percent. The net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was $141 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and is callable without penalty beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. Receivables Factoring At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we also had sold $226 million and $264 million, respectively, of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retained servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. See Note 15—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Monetization At December 31, 2002, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to two Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) in revolving-period securitization arrangements. These arrangements provided for us to sell, and the QSPEs to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPEs to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.5 billion to five bank-sponsored entities. All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPEs because they meet the requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips. During 2003, we purchased from the bank-sponsored entities the senior interests of one of our two existing QSPEs and discontinued selling receivables to it. We have consolidated this QSPE since acquiring the senior interests. Also during 2003, the third-party beneficial interest holders approved amendments to the other QSPE to increase the amount of third-party beneficial interests that can be issued to $1.2 billion. These changes resulted in a net reduction of the maximum level of senior beneficial interests that can be issued to third-party beneficial interest holders from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2003 60 Table of Contents and 2002, we had sold accounts receivable of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE meets the isolation requirements and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales. Accordingly, receivables transferred to the QSPEs were accounted for as sales. We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable—related parties, were $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated beneficial interests approximates fair market value due to the short term of the underlying assets, which makes stress testing unnecessary. Preferred Stock During 1996 and 1997, we formed two statutory business trusts, Phillips 66 Capital I (Trust I) and Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trusts. The sole purpose of the trusts was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The two trusts were established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. On May 31, 2002, we redeemed all of the outstanding subordinated debt securities held by Trust I, which triggered the redemption of the $300 million of trust preferred securities of Trust I at par value, $25 per share. The redemption was funded by the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities. We made interest payments in 2003 totaling $29 million. In addition, we have guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we have made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. Prior to January 1, 2003, we consolidated Trust II and the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The subordinated debt securities and related income statement effects were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. However, with the adoption of the provisions of FIN 46, effective January 1, 2003, we were required to deconsolidate Trust II, which had the effect of increasing debt by $361 million since the subordinated debt securities were no longer eliminated in consolidation, and removing the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities from our balance sheet. When we redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all the redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 19—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Affiliated Companies As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2003, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. • Hamaca: The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a jointly owned 61 Table of Contents limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2003 were approximately $284 million, expenses were approximately $143 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $143 million. We have a 57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co-venturers in the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing for our heavy-crude oil project in Venezuela. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17-year-term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14-year-term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $969 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2003. Of this amount, $388 million is recourse to ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings are being used to primarily fund a heavy-oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding will be provided by capital contributions from the co-venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005), the joint project financings will become non-recourse with respect to the co-venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca project’s cash flows for payment. • Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP): MSLP is a limited partnership in which we and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with PDVSA, are jointly-and-severally liable for under a construction completion guarantee. The bond proceeds were used to fund construction of a coker, vacuum unit and related facilities at our Sweeny, Texas, refinery, plus certain improvements to existing facilities at the same location. MSLP owns the coker and vacuum unit and, in the third quarter of 2000, began processing long residue produced from the Venezuelan Merey crude oil delivered under a supply agreement that we have with PDVSA. MSLP charges us a fee, which totaled approximately $145 million in 2003, to process the long residue through the vacuum unit and coker. This is the partnership’s primary source of revenue. MSLP revenues for 2003 were approximately $162 million, expenses were approximately $140 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $31 million. If completion certification is not attained by June 18, 2004, the 8.85 percent bonds could be called and the bondholders would look to the two MSLP partners for repayment. MSLP is currently awaiting receipt of a permit for a new waste water pipeline and working to resolve issues in placing its insurance program, after which we expect to achieve completion certification in the second quarter of 2004. Upon completion certification, the 8.85 percent bonds become non-recourse to the two MSLP partners and the bondholders can then look only to MSLP cash flows for payment. We purchased the improvements to existing facilities from MSLP for a price equal to the cost of construction, and MSLP provided seller financing. Terms of financing provide for 240 monthly payments of principal and interest commencing September 2000 with interest accruing at a 7 percent annual rate. The principal balance due on the seller financing was $131 million at December 31, 2003, and is included as long-term debt in our balance sheet. MSLP pays a monthly access fee to us, which totaled approximately $20 million in 2003, for the use of the improvements to the refinery. The access fee equals the monthly principal and interest paid by us to purchase the improvements from MSLP. To the extent the access fee is not paid by MSLP, we are not obligated to make payments for the improvements. During the first quarter of 2002, MSLP issued $25 million of tax-exempt bonds due 2021. This issuance, combined with similar bonds MSLP issued in 1998, 2000, and 2001, bring the total outstanding to $100 million. As a result of the company’s support as a primary obligor of a 50 percent share of these MSLP financings, $50 million of long-term debt is included in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 62 Table of Contents • Other: At December 31, 2003, we had guarantees of approximately $340 million outstanding for our portion of other joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 22 years. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $158 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia. Payment will be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below. Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2003, was $17.8 billion. This reflects debt reductions of approximately $4.8 billion during 2003, including accounting changes that increased balance sheet debt approximately $2.8 billion as a result of the adoption of FIN 46. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we reduced our commercial paper balance outstanding from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, to $709 million at December 31, 2003. In 2003, we paid off the following notes and debt facilities as they were called or matured and funded the payments with cash from operating activities and proceeds from asset dispositions: • $250 million 8.49% Notes due 2023, at 104.245 percent; • $150 million 8.25% Mortgage Bonds due May 15, 2003; • $250 million 7.92% Notes due in 2023, at 103.96 percent; • $250 million 7.20% Notes due 2023, at 103.60 percent; • $100 million 6.65% Notes that matured on March 1, 2003; • $180 million SRW Cogeneration Limited Partnership note; • $500 million Floating Rate Notes due April 15, 2003; • $90 million Tosco Trust 2000-E 8.78% Senior Secured Notes due 2010; • $245 million Tosco Trust 2000-E 8.58% Senior Secured Notes due 2010; • $199 million Arctic Funding, Limited Partnership 6.85% Senior Secured Note due 2011; • $100 million of floating rate aviation equipment lease obligations having a final maturity in 2004; • $489 million of fixed and floating rate ocean vessel lease obligations having final maturities from 2004 to 2005; and • $1,130 million of floating rate marketing lease obligations having maturities from 2003 to 2006. In October and November 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Also during 2003, we issued $79.5 million of tax-exempt bonds and assumed an additional amount of $20 million. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2003: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to 1-3 3-5 After At December 31, 2003 Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations* $ 17,720 1,434 3,110 1,202 11,974 Capital lease obligations 60 6 12 38 4 Total debt 17,780 1,440 3,122 1,240 11,978 Operating lease obligations 3,073 471 810 619 1,173 Purchase obligations** 58,231 19,972 4,869 3,915 29,475 Other long-term liabilities*** Asset retirement obligations 2,685 61 242 364 2,018 Accrued environmental costs 1,119 140 304 138 537 Total $ 82,888 22,084 9,347 6,276 45,181 * Total debt excluding capital lease obligations. Includes net unamortized premiums and discounts. ** Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $23.0 billion, of which $11.1 billion are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $5.6 billion primarily related to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $4.4 billion primarily related to natural gas for resale to customers, $1.7 billion of futures, and $217 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $23.3 billion of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 97 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co-owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of Petrozuata crude oil for a market-based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 16-year term if a variety of conditions are met. *** Does not include: (1) Taxes—the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production, payroll and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $2,676 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions—for the 2004 through 2008 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $400 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $100 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. Our required minimum funding in 2004 is expected to be $95 million in the United States and $75 million outside the United States; (3) Severance—we have expected severance payments of $109 million in 2004 and $3 million in 2005; and (4) Interest—we anticipate payments of $1,046 million in 2004, $2,012 million for the period 2005 through 2006, $1,708 million for the period 2007 through 2008, and $8,955 million for the remaining years to total $13,721 million. 64 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2004 Budget 2003 2002 2001 E&P United States—Alaska $ 656 570 706 965 United States—Lower 48 763 848 499 389 International 3,939 3,090 2,071 1,162 5,358 4,508 3,276 2,516 Midstream 10 10 5 — R&M United States 1,039 860 676 423 International 246 319 164 5 1,285 1,179 840 428 Chemicals — — 60 6 Emerging Businesses 62 284 122 — Corporate and Other* 167 188 85 66 $ 6,882 6,169 4,388 3,016 United States $ 2,639 2,493 2,043 1,849 International 4,243 3,676 2,345 1,167 $ 6,882 6,169 4,388 3,016 Discontinued operations $ — 224 97 69 * Excludes discontinued operations. Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three-year period ending December 31, 2003, totaled $13.6 billion. Spending was primarily focused on the growth of our E&P business, with 76 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. The capital programs of DEFS, our gas gathering, processing and marketing joint-venture company, and CPChem, our chemicals joint-venture company, are intended to be self-funding, and are not reflected in the amounts above. Including about $500 million in capitalized interest and $400 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export project, our Board has approved $6.9 billion for capital projects and investments for continuing operations in 2004, a 12 percent increase over our 2003 capital spending of $6.2 billion. We plan to direct 78 percent of our 2004 capital budget to E&P and 19 percent to R&M. The remaining budget will be allocated toward emerging businesses, mainly power generation; and general corporate purposes, with a majority related to global integration of systems. Thirty-eight percent of the budget is targeted for projects in the United States. E&P Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2003, totaled $10.3 billion. The expenditures over the three-year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: • National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and satellite field prospects on Alaska’s North Slope; 65 Table of Contents • Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; • Canadian conventional oil and gas projects, the Surmont oil sands project and expansion of the Syncrude project; • The Hamaca heavy-oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt; • The Jade, Clair, CMS3 and Britannia satellite developments in the United Kingdom; • The Grane field and Ekofisk Area growth project in the Norwegian North Sea; • The Kashagan field in the north Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan; • The Peng Lai 19-3 discovery in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects; • The Bayu-Undan gas recycle and gas development projects in the Timor Sea; • Blocks 15-1 and 15-2 in Vietnam; • The Belanak and Suban projects in Indonesia; and • Acquisition of deepwater exploratory interests in Angola, Nigeria, Brazil, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the E&P segment. We have contracted to build, for approximately $200 million each, five double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. During 2001, the Polar Endeavour, the first Endeavour Class tanker, entered service. The second tanker, the Polar Resolution, entered service in May 2002 and the third tanker, the Polar Discovery, was delivered for service in September 2003. We expect to add a new Endeavour Class tanker to our fleet in both 2004 and 2005, allowing us to retire older ships and cancel non-operated charters. In Alaska, we continued development drilling in the Kuparuk, Tabasco and West Sak fields in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Prudhoe Bay satellite fields and the Alpine field. In 2003, we, along with our co-venturers, drilled or participated in 71 new development wells at Greater Prudhoe Bay, 17 new development wells at Greater Kuparuk and five development wells at Alpine. Also in 2003, funds were expended on the Alpine capacity expansion project that is expected to start up in the second half of 2004. In the Lower 48, we continued to explore and develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, development drilling has been completed in the Magnolia and Princess Phase 1 fields. Sanction for the K2 project development is expected in the first quarter of 2004. Preliminary engineering for Princess Phase 2 and Ursa waterflood is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2004. Magnolia’s tension-leg platform construction is ongoing and first production is expected prior to the end of 2004. In February 2003, we began drilling the Lorien exploration well on Block 199, which was declared a discovery in July. The well has been temporarily suspended pending evaluation of development alternatives. The Voss deepwater exploratory well drilled in Keathley Canyon Block 511 was declared dry in early 2003 and as required was charged against 2002 earnings. The Yorick deepwater exploratory well in Green Canyon Block 435 was declared a dry hole in late 2003. Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is pursuing select opportunities in its other producing basins. 66 Table of Contents In Canada, we continued with development of the Stage III expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is expected to increase our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2 project (the new mine) started up in late-October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2003, approval was obtained for our project in Surmont. Our ownership share is 43.5 percent. The Surmont lease covers over 200 square miles. This initial development project is designed to use “steam assisted gravity drainage” technology, with first oil production expected in 2006. In addition to these projects, we also are involved in conventional oil and gas properties in Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we began production of heavy crude oil from the Hamaca project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt. Construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium-grade crude oil continues. Completion of the upgrader is expected by the end of 2004. We own a 40 percent equity interest in the Hamaca project. Our other heavy-oil project in Venezuela, Petrozuata, incurred capital expenditures in 2003 associated with solids handling and restoration capacity projects, as well as ongoing drilling. In addition to the Hamaca and Petrozuata developments, we have an interest in the Corocoro oil discovery in Venezuela’s Gulf of Paria West. In April 2003, Venezuelan authorities and co-venturers approved Phase I of the development plan for the Corocoro field. We are the operator of the block. In September 2003, we acquired a 37.5 percent interest in the Gulf of Paria East Block. A portion of the Corocoro discovery extends onto this block. Our interest in the development is 32.2 percent. In February 2003, Venezuelan authorities granted a 35-year license to ChevronTexaco to appraise and develop Plataforma Deltana Block 2. ChevronTexaco selected us as their minority partner in accordance with the terms of the license, which was approved by the Venezuelan government in late 2003. We now have a 40 percent interest in the project. Plataforma Deltana Block 2 is located to the east of our Corocoro discovery. Block 2 already has a gas discovery on it, and additional drilling is planned for 2004. In Brazil, we added joint-venture partners for our two deepwater blocks, BM-ES-11 and BM-PAMA-3, and purchased additional seismic data in 2002. In 2003, 3-D seismic results indicated the prospect for BM-ES-11 was below expectations, leading to a write-off of our leasehold investment and the initiation of plans to exit the block. Further evaluation of BM-PAMA-3 is planned for 2004. In 2003, we continued with several development projects in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, including the Clair field in the U.K. sector. We expect first production from Clair in late 2004. Late in the third quarter of 2003, we and our co-venturers began oil production from the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea. Net peak production from proved reserves of approximately 14,000 barrels per day is anticipated in 2005. We continued the development of the CMS3 area, a single unitized project, comprising five natural gas reservoirs in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea. Collectively, the fields are known as CMS3 due to their utilization of the production and transportation facilities of our operated Caister Murdoch System (CMS). In September 2002, production commenced from the Hawksley field, followed in the fourth quarter by production at the Murdoch K field. During 2003, McAdam came onstream in the second quarter and Watt began in the fourth quarter. Drilling operations on the final reservoir, Boulton H, are ongoing in 2004. We are the operator of CMS3 and hold a 59.5 percent interest. In December 2003, our Board approved the development of the Britannia field satellites in the North Sea. A development plan has been submitted for government approval. These satellites are comprised of the Callanish and Brodgar fields. The Callanish field is an oil reservoir, and the Brodgar field is a gas 67 Table of Contents condensate reservoir with properties similar to those of Britannia. The fields are planned to be developed jointly via a bridge-linked platform to Britannia, with production startup scheduled for 2007. We are the operator of both fields with an interest of 75 percent in Brodgar and 83.5 percent in Callanish. Elsewhere in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, in 2003, we, along with our co-venturers, approved a plan to further develop the Ekofisk Area to increase the recovery of oil and gas from the area by improving the area’s processing capacity and reliability. The Ekofisk growth project consists of two interrelated components: the construction and installation of a new steel wellhead and process platform and an increase in capacity from existing facilities. We expect to complete and install the steel jacket in 2004 and the topsides early in the summer of 2005. Additional production from this development is anticipated to begin in the fall of 2005. We are modifying the existing Ekofisk Complex and four additional platforms to increase processing capacity. In 2002, we and our co-venturers, in conjunction with the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the north Caspian Sea to be commercial. A development plan for the field was approved by the Republic of Kazakhstan in February 2004. Four of five planned appraisal wells on Kashagan had been successfully completed by the end of 2003. The fifth well is currently being tested. In May 2002, we along with the other remaining co-venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of two co-venturers' rights, which increased our ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. In October 2002, we and our co-venturers announced a new hydrocarbon discovery in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea. In 2003, a 3-D survey was carried out over the Kalamkas field and an initial appraisal well is planned for 2005. During 2003, we exercised our pre-emptive rights related to B.G. International’s sale of their share in the North Caspian License that includes the Kashagan field. The transaction is expected to close in 2004, at which time our interest in the license will increase from 8.33 percent to 10.19 percent. In November 2003, we and our co-venturers announced the successful completion of the first offshore exploration wells on the Aktote and Kashagan Southwest prospects. These two wells are located in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea in an area adjacent to the Kashagan field. Another exploration well, on the Kairan prospect, completed drilling in 2003 and will be tested in 2004. In late-December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19-3 development located on Block 11/05 in China’s Bohai Bay. During 2003, we continued with planning and design for Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3 development, which includes multiple wellhead platforms, central processing facilities, and a floating storage and offloading facility. We are developing, in conjunction with Phase II, the Peng Lai 25-6 oil field, located three miles east of Peng Lai 19-3. We also drilled exploration wells on the Peng Lai 19-9 prospect and the Peng Lai 13-1 prospect, which resulted in two discoveries. The Peng Lai 19-9-1 well is located two miles east of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, and along with adjacent structures will be a part of the Phase II development. In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with the Bayu-Undan gas recycle and gas development projects. We continued to drill future production wells and have installed all major facilities, including two production, processing and living quarters platforms and an unmanned production platform. A multi-product floating, storage and offloading vessel was connected to the production facilities during the fourth quarter of 2003. First liquids production began in February 2004, and full capacity of 62,000 net barrels per day of condensate and natural gas liquids is anticipated to be reached in the third quarter of 2004. An average rate of 23,000 net barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids is expected for 2004. 68 Table of Contents We also have received approval of the gas development plan for the Bayu-Undan project from the Timor Sea Designated Authority, concluded fiscal and legal provisions with the government of Timor Lesté, and executed new production sharing contract (PSC) arrangements with the Designated Authority. The gas development project includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, including a pipeline to Darwin, Australia. The first LNG cargo from the 3.52 million-ton-per-year facility is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. During the third quarter of 2003, construction of the LNG facility and the pipeline began. In June 2003, we sold what currently equates to a 10.08 percent interest in the unitized Bayu-Undan field; purchased other interests that currently equate to a 2.65 percent interest in the field; sold a 43.3 percent interest in the Bayu-Undan pipeline under construction; and sold a 43.3 percent interest in Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (owner of the LNG plant to be constructed). The net result is that we retain a 56.72 percent controlling interest in the integrated project. In Vietnam’s Block 15-1, the Su Tu Den Phase I (southwest area) development project was approved in December 2001 and production from this area began in late-October 2003. We also are evaluating the commerciality of the Su Tu Vang fields and the northeast portion of the Su Tu Den field. In November 2003, we announced the completion of a successful exploratory well in the Su Tu Trang field in Block 15-1. Technical evaluation is in progress to assess the reservoir potential of the Su Tu Trang field. In the third quarter of 2002, we began production from two new wellhead platforms in the Block 15-2 Rang Dong field in Vietnam. During late 2003, field facilities were upgraded to include a utilities-living quarters platform, and a central processing platform with facilities to enable gas lift, gas export and water injection. With the completion of these facilities, water injection is now possible on all three wellhead platforms and gas lift is possible on the N-1 and E-1 wellhead platforms. These facilities became operational in the fourth quarter of 2003. We continued with the appraisal and development of key gas fields in Indonesia. In 2003, we announced the successful test of the Suban-8 delineation well on the southwest flank of the Suban gas field, located in the Corridor PSC of South Sumatra. We also completed the successful test of the North Sumpal-1 well in the Sakakemang Block located in South Sumatra, and continued on the construction of the South Jambi gas project in the South Jambi B Block also located in South Sumatra. In addition, we continue to develop the offshore Belanak and other fields in the Block B PSC in the Natuna Sea, for which a floating production storage and offloading vessel is under construction. The vessel is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005. In May 2002, initial results showed that the first exploratory well drilled in Block 34, offshore Angola, was a dry hole. In view of this information, we reassessed the fair value of the remainder of the block and determined that our investment in the block was impaired by $77 million, both before- and after-tax. In December 2003, the second exploration well was drilled in Block 34, offshore Angola. The well encountered non-commercial gas and was plugged and abandoned. In view of this information, we fully impaired our remaining investment in the block. In 2003, we obtained a 40 percent interest in Block 248 and a 20 percent interest in Block 214, both offshore Nigeria. First exploration drilling is planned for Block 248 in the second quarter of 2004. Other capital spending for E&P during the three-year period ended December 31, 2003, supported: • The Eldfisk waterflood development in Norway; • The Jade field development in the United Kingdom; • The acquisition and development of coalbed methane and conventional gas prospects and producing properties in the U.S. Lower 48; and 69 Table of Contents • North Sea prospects in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors, plus other Atlantic Margin wells in the United Kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. 2004 Capital Budget E&P’s 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $5.4 billion, 19 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2003. Twenty-six percent of E&P’s 2004 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 46 percent of that slated for Alaska. We have budgeted $628 million for worldwide exploration capital activities in 2004, with 17 percent of that amount, $106 million, allocated to the United States. Outside the United States, significant exploration expenditures are planned in Kazakhstan, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and Norway. We plan to spend $656 million in 2004 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations—including additional work on the Alpine capacity expansion project, Orion and West Sak field developments—construction of Endeavour Class tankers, and the exploratory activity discussed above. In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on the continued development of the Magnolia, Ursa and Princess fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, such as the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. E&P is directing $3.9 billion of its 2004 capital budget to international projects. The majority of these funds will be directed to developing major long-term projects, including the Bayu-Undan liquids and gas development projects in the Timor Sea; the Hamaca heavy-oil project in Venezuela; additional development of oil and gas reserves in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra blocks in Indonesia; the second phase of Bohai Bay in China; projects in the Caspian region, including Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline; projects in Canada, including Syncrude, Surmont heavy-oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas development; and the Qatargas 3 LNG facility in Qatar. In addition, funds will be used to expand the company’s positions in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $2,002 million, $1,631 million, and $1,423 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2004 through 2006 were projected to be $1,767 million, $1,111 million, and $659 million, respectively. R&M Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2003, was primarily for refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, to meet new environmental standards, to improve the operating integrity of key processing units, and to install advanced process control technology, as well as for safety projects. Total capital spending for continuing operations for R&M for the three-year period was $2.4 billion, representing 18 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations. 70 Table of Contents Key projects during the three-year period included: • Construction of a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in New Jersey; • Construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S Zorb™ Sulfur Removal Technology (S Zorb) unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery; • Expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery; • Capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the Borger, Texas, refinery; • Completion of a commercial S Zorb unit at the Borger refinery; • An expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude-oil pipeline; and • Installation of an advanced central control building and associated technologies at the Borger facility. In early 2003, we completed three major projects: a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and both a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S Zorb unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. The Bayway polypropylene plant utilizes propylene feedstock from the Bayway refinery to make up to 775 million pounds per year of polypropylene. The plant became operational in March 2003. At Ferndale, the fluid catalytic cracking unit significantly improves gasoline production per barrel of crude input and the new S Zorb unit reduces sulfur in gasoline. Both became fully operational in 2003. Also in 2003, we made investments related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects throughout our refining system. We completed projects at our refineries in Ponca City, Oklahoma and Roxana, Illinois, to produce the low-sulfur gasoline required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also began construction of a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco area refinery that is expected to produce reformulated California highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline. In July 2003, we completed the acquisition of certain refining assets in Hartford, Illinois, from Premcor. The operations of these assets are being integrated into the operations of our nearby Wood River refinery. The overall production of the refinery will only increase slightly, but integration of the new assets will enable the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil. Startup of the integrated facilities is expected in the second quarter of 2004. Internationally, we continue to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in Europe and Asia. 2004 Capital Budget R&M’s 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.3 billion, a 9 percent increase over spending of $1.2 billion in 2003. Domestic spending is expected to consume 81 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $900 million of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily to fund clean fuels projects in order to comply with new EPA standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our R&M business is expected to be about $600 million, or 55 percent of the total refining budget. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $125 million, while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 71 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during 2003 was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. We expect the plant to be operational in mid-2004. Emerging Businesses’ 2004 capital budget of $62 million is primarily dedicated to the completion of the Immingham plant. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial statements. All significant litigation arising from the March 27, 2000, explosion and fire that occurred in an out-of-service butadiene storage tank at the K-Resin styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBC) plant has now been resolved. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions; • Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies; • Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur; • Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste; • Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States; • Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments; • Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and 72 Table of Contents • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated a number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally mandated operating permit program. Violations of the Clean Air Act and most other environmental laws and regulations in the United States are enforceable with civil and criminal sanctions. The EPA also has promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of gasoline, known generically as the “Tier II Sulfur Rules,” the first phase requirements of which became applicable to our gasoline as of January 2004. To meet the requirements, we are implementing a compliance strategy that relies on the use of a combination of technologies, including our proprietary S Zorb technology. The EPA also has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting non-road diesel fuel sulfur content. If promulgated, this rule would significantly reduce non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are currently evaluating S Zorb systems for removing sulfur from diesel fuel in special applications. The refining industry is actively considering several advanced and conventional technologies for complying with these rules. Because the non-road rule is not final, we are still evaluating and developing capital strategies for future compliance. Additional areas of potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. If adopted, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol 73 Table of Contents but may in the future. In addition, other countries where we have interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. Currently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs that we could incur to comply with such regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2002, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 58 sites around the United States. In the 2002 report, sites from Phillips and Conoco were listed separately resulting in eight duplicate listings. These duplicate listings are consolidated in this 2003 report. At December 31, 2003, we had combined the eight duplicate listings, reclassified one existing site, and resolved six sites. Additionally, we had received 16 new notices of potential liability, leaving 61 sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 74 Table of Contents Expensed environmental costs were $593 million in 2003 and are expected to be about $596 million in 2004 and $574 million in 2005. Capitalized environmental costs were $522 million in 2003 and are expected to be about $742 million and $967 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Remediation Accruals We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we have identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2003. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2003, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of $1,119 million, compared with $743 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in accruals from year-end 2002, primarily resulted from evaluation of Conoco environmental liabilities during the purchase price allocation period. We expect to incur the majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, alternative minimum tax credits, and loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. The alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce our regular tax liability. 75 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” which revises and requires additional disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by previous Financial Accounting Board Standards. We adopted the provisions of this Standard effective December 2003. Certain provisions of this Standard regarding disclosure of information about foreign plans and disclosure of estimated future benefit payments are not required until 2004. The adoption of the provisions applicable to 2003 did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position, nor will the adoption of the additional provisions in 2004 have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement was immediately effective for all contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, and became effective July 1, 2003, for all previously existing contracts. On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3, which deferred certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. As a result of adopting this new accounting standard in the third quarter of 2003, and the subsequent November 7, 2003, deferral of certain provisions, there was no impact on our 2003 financial statements. We continue to monitor the deferral status of SFAS No. 150. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which became effective on July 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, respectively. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) to consider the issue of whether SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 require interests held under oil, gas and mineral leases to be separately classified as intangible assets on the balance sheets of companies in the extractive industries. Historically, in accordance with SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” we have capitalized the cost of oil and gas leasehold interests and, consistent with industry practice, reported these assets as part of tangible E&P properties, plants and equipment. If such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the EITF, mineral rights to extract oil and gas for both proved and unproved properties would be classified separately from E&P properties, plants and equipment as intangible assets on our balance sheet. This interpretation by the EITF would only affect the classification of oil and gas mineral rights on our balance sheet and would not affect total assets, net worth, results of operations or cash flows. E&P properties, plants and equipment at December 31, 2003 and 2002, included approximately $10.5 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of mineral rights to extract oil and gas, net of accumulated depletion, that would be reclassified on the balance sheet as intangible assets, if the interpretation that the SEC requested the EITF to consider was applied. We plan to continue to classify oil and gas mineral rights as E&P properties, plants and equipment until further guidance is provided by the EITF. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies 76 Table of Contents in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Compliance Committee on an annual basis and are presented below. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a judgmental determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort. This judgment usually is made within two months of the completion of the drilling effort, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geologic structure. Accounting rules require that this judgment be made at least within one year of well completion. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration expense. Exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a major capital expenditure (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly planned. For complicated offshore exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal work on the potential oil and gas field. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term. 77 Table of Contents See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties, as well as the Wells In Progress disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared productive or dry. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of “proved” oil and gas reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s oil and gas operations. The judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that field. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut-in for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Canadian Syncrude Reserves Canadian Syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely. Reserve estimates of Canadian Syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place crude bitumen volume, the mining plan, historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 12—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 78 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. The largest asset removal obligations facing us involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note 1—Accounting Policies and Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests, which requires management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 6—Acquisition of Tosco Corporation, Note 3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 12—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting 79 Table of Contents unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies’ operations did not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas. In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating segment. In contrast, in our Refining and Marketing operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and Marketing operating segment level. Instead, we have identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment has to be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management has to use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year-end 2003, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units, excluding those included in discontinued operations, ranged from between 15 percent to 35 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the $15.1 billion of goodwill. 80 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation Prior to the acquisition of Tosco in September 2001 and the merger in August 2002, our inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost basis were predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers established many years ago, when price levels were much lower. Therefore, prior to 2001, our LIFO inventories were relatively insensitive to current price level changes. However, the acquisition of Tosco and the ConocoPhillips merger added LIFO cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels prevalent in late September 2001 and August 2002, respectively. As a result, our LIFO cost inventories are now much more sensitive to lower-of-cost-or-market impairment write-downs, whenever price levels fall. We recorded a LIFO inventory lower-of-cost-or-market impairment in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to a crude oil price deterioration. While crude oil is not the only product in the company’s LIFO pools, its market value is a major factor in lower-of-cost-or-market calculations. We estimate that additional impairments could occur if a 60 percent/40 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $21.25 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the lower-of-cost-or-market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $85 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $25 million. OUTLOOK After adjusting for asset dispositions, E&P’s worldwide production for 2004 is expected to be about the same level as it was in 2003. The dispositions contributed approximately 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 2003 production. For 2004, production increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America are expected to offset net declines in the United States, Canada and the North Sea. In R&M, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during 2004. In addition, we expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2004 to average about the same as in 2003. 81 Table of Contents Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which we have no control, such as global economic conditions, political events, demand growth, inventory levels, weather, competing fuels prices, and availability of supply. Crude oil prices rose significantly in 2003 due to supply disruptions during the year in several producing countries and the delays in the return of Iraqi crude production to the market in the face of rising global oil demand. As a result of these factors, global oil inventories remained at exceptionally low levels throughout 2003. Low oil inventories, coupled with economic recovery and the prospects for higher oil demand growth are expected to keep prices elevated through the first half of 2004. U.S. natural gas prices weakened moderately during the second half of 2003 from the very strong levels experienced during the second quarter, but the annual average was significantly higher in 2003 versus 2002. Prices weakened in the second half due to a strong buildup of natural gas inventories during the summer and early fall, as mild weather, weak industrial demand and fuel switching reduced natural gas demand. At the same time, high prices and the startup of a mothballed regasification terminal increased LNG imports to the United States. However, natural gas prices rose moderately in December, reflecting continuing concerns about the adequacy of gas supplies in the United States. Supply adequacy concerns are expected to keep prices above historical levels in 2004. Refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the prices of petroleum products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control, such as the U.S. and global economies; government regulations; military, political and social conditions in oil producing countries; seasonal factors that affect demand, such as the summer driving months; and the levels of refining output and product inventories. U.S. and international refining and marketing margins rose in 2003 versus 2002, due to improved refined product demand and a series of supply disruptions. U.S. refining margins were above the five-year historical average in 2003 as a result of refinery outages in several regions of the United States, a product pipeline rupture in Arizona, and labor strikes in Venezuela, which removed both crude and refined products from the market. Combined with strong product demand, product inventories were drawn down to extremely low levels in the first half of the year, which elevated refining margins. Stronger demand in the face of tight supplies also improved marketing margins in 2003 versus 2002. The sustainability of current refining and marketing margins depends on the continued recovery of the global economy and refined product demand growth. In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 17 percent in February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations. In addition, our Venezuelan operations remain subject to civil unrest in the country. Our Venezuelan operations contributed approximately $150 million to our 2003 net income. In June 2003, we and our co-venturers in the Mackenzie gas project in Canada announced that funding and participation agreements have been reached and a preliminary information package was submitted to relevant regulatory authorities. The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities, compression and gathering pipelines in the Mackenzie Delta area, and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. The filing of the information package is a key step in the process leading to the submission of applications for the development of the natural gas fields and pipeline facilities. Regulatory applications are expected to be filed in 2004. First gas production is currently targeted to commence in late 2009. In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas 3, a large-scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies. Qatargas 3 would be an integrated project, jointly owned by us and Qatar Petroleum, consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatar’s North field. The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be 82 Table of Contents responsible for regasification and marketing within the United States. Average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe. In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front-end engineering and design work for an LNG facility to be constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta. The participants have agreed to form an incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in 2005, and the facility is targeted to be operational in 2009. In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The Statement of Intent initiates detailed technical and commercial pre-front-end engineering and design studies and establishes principles for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir-to-market plant. More definite agreements are expected in 2004. Also in December 2003, we announced the signing of an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We would acquire 1 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in the terminal for our use and obtain a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture. The terminal will be designed with a storage capacity of 6.9 billion cubic feet and a send-out capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. Pending government approvals, construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2004, with commercial startup in mid-2007. In addition, we and our co-venturer are pursuing a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Harpswell, Maine. The proposal calls for construction of the terminal at a site previously used as a U.S. Navy fuel depot. LNG would be converted back to natural gas at the terminal for delivery through a new pipeline that would connect the terminal to the existing pipeline grid. Depending on receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 2006, with the facility operational by 2009. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This annual report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar expressions. We have based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcome and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business; • Changes in our business, operations, results and prospects; • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures; 83 Table of Contents • Potential failure to realize fully or within the expected time frame the expected cost savings and synergies from the combination of Conoco and Phillips; • Costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses of Conoco and Phillips, as well as the continued integration of businesses recently acquired by each of them; • Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance; • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities; • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance; • Unexpected cost increases or technical difficulties in constructing or modifying facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining; • Unexpected difficulties in manufacturing or refining our refined products, including synthetic crude oil, and chemicals products; • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, LNG and refined products; • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance; • Potential disruption or interruption of our facilities due to accidents, political events or terrorism; • International monetary conditions and exchange controls; • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations; • Liability resulting from litigation; • General domestic and international economic and political conditions, including armed hostilities, homeland security, and governmental disputes over territorial boundaries; • Changes in tax and other laws or regulations applicable to our business; and • Inability to obtain economical financing for exploration and development projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority 84 Table of Contents Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial group manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial group uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand; • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price; • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions; and • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2003, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. 85 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2003, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2003, were as follows: 87 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Notional Fair Market Value Foreign Currency Swaps Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro $ 267 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound 789 26 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone 12 — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norway kroner 380 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona 93 5 At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had the following significant foreign currency derivative contracts: • Approximately $194 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company’s European commercial paper program, with a fair value of $7.1 million; • Approximately $536 million in foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between U.K. subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary, with a fair value of $9 million; and • Approximately $24 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company’s firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in Germany, with a negative fair value of $4 million. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Assuming an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2002, exchange rates, the potential foreign currency remeasurement loss in non-cash pretax earnings from these swaps, intercompany loans, and commercial paper would be approximately $3 million. In addition to the intercompany loans discussed above, at December 31, 2002, U.S. subsidiaries held long-term sterling-denominated intercompany receivables totaling $152 million due from a U.K. subsidiary. A Norwegian subsidiary held $198 million of intercompany U.S. dollar-denominated receivables due from its U.S. parent at December 31, 2002. The potential foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses in non-cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical 10 percent change in the year-end 2002 exchange rates from these intercompany balances was $35 million.

The words “intends,” “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “should,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 98. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 35,600 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2005 had assets of $107 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P) —This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily includes our 50 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a joint venture with Duke Energy Corporation. • Refining and Marketing (R&M) —This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Our investment was 16.1 percent at December 31, 2005. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron Corporation. • Emerging Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations, including new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products (e.g., gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power generation, and emerging technologies. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market 50 factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including: • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: • Successful exploration and development of new fields. • Acquisition of existing fields. • Applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In late 2005, we signed an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation under which we and our co-venturers acquired an ownership interest in the Waha concessions in Libya. As a result, we added 238 million barrels to our net proved crude oil reserves in 2005. In the three years ending December 31, 2005, our reserve replacement exceeded 100 percent, including the impact of our equity investments. The replacement rate was primarily attributable to our investment in LUKOIL, other purchases of reserves in place, and extensions and discoveries. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects and the anticipated additional ownership interest in LUKOIL. • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. During 2005, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was 93 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2004. The reduced utilization rate reflects the impact of hurricanes on our U.S. refining operations during 2005. Finally, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2005 totaled $11.6 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $11.2 billion in 2006, including our expenditures to re-enter Libya. The 2006 amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in LUKOIL. 51 • Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2004, we substantially completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger. Also during 2004, we acquired a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, a major Russian integrated energy company. During 2005, we increased our investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 16.1 percent ownership interest. Also during 2005, we entered into an agreement to acquire Burlington Resources Inc., an independent exploration and production company with a substantial position in North American natural gas reserves and production. The transaction has a preliminary value of $33.9 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Burlington Resources shareholders would receive $46.50 in cash and 0.7214 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources share they own. This transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2006, subject to approval by Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting set for March 30, 2006. • Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins, decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. Property impairments in 2005 totaled $42 million, compared with $164 million in 2004. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. • Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year-end 2005 we had $15.3 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative, though non-cash, effect on our profitability. • Tax jurisdictions. As a global company, our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of earnings within our global operations. Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2005, which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment. Industry crude oil prices were approximately $15 per barrel (or 36 percent) higher in 2005, compared with 2004, averaging $56.44 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate. The increase primarily was due to robust global consumption associated with the continuing global economic recovery, as well as oil supply disruptions in Iraq, and disruptions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In addition, there was little excess OPEC production capacity 52 available to replace lost supplies. Industry U.S. natural gas prices were $2.51 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) (or 41 percent) higher in 2005, compared with 2004, averaging approximately $8.64 per MMBTU for Henry Hub. Natural gas prices increased in 2005 due primarily to higher oil prices, continued concerns regarding the adequacy of U.S. natural gas supplies, and the hurricanes disrupting production and distribution in the Gulf Coast region. Looking forward, prices for both crude and natural gas are expected to decrease in 2006 from 2005 levels, while remaining strong relative to long-term historical averages. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DEFS. During 2005, we increased our ownership interest in DEFS from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. During 2005, we recorded a gain of $306 million, after-tax, for our equity share of DEFS’ sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO). Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Refining margins in 2005 were stronger in comparison to 2004, resulting in improved R&M profitability. The U.S. Gulf Coast light oil spread increased 68 percent, from an average of $6.49 per barrel in 2004 to $10.92 per barrel in 2005. Key factors driving the 2005 growth in refining margins were healthy growth in demand for refined products in the United States and other countries worldwide, as well as concerns over adequate supplies due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaging refining and distribution infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. Our marketing margins were lower in 2005, compared with 2004, due to the market’s inability to pass through higher crude and product costs. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of 2004 and all of 2005, we acquired additional shares in the open market for an additional $2.8 billion, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 16.1 percent by year-end 2005. We initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to Russia’s resource potential, where LUKOIL has significant positions in proved reserves and production. We also are benefiting from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our E&P segment should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in the northern Timan-Pechora region of Russia, and an opportunity to potentially participate in the development of the West Qurna field in Iraq. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. Our financial results from Chemicals in 2005 were the strongest since the formation of CPChem in 2000, as this business line has emerged from a deep cyclical downturn that began around that time. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years. At December 31, 2005, we had a debt-to-capital ratio of 19 percent, compared with 26 percent at the end of 2004. The decrease was due to a $2.5 billion reduction in debt during 2005, along with increased equity reflecting strong earnings. Upon completion of the Burlington Resources acquisition, we expect our debt- 53 to-capital ratio to increase into the low-30-percent range. However, we expect debt reduction to be a priority after the acquisition, allowing us to move back toward a mid-to-low-20-percent debt-to-capital ratio within three years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 8,430 5,702 4,302 Midstream 688 235 130 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 4,173 2,743 1,272 LUKOIL Investment 714 74 — Chemicals 323 249 7 Emerging Businesses (21 ) (102 ) (99 ) Corporate and Other (778 ) (772 ) (877 ) Net income $ 13,529 8,129 4,735 The improved results in 2005 and 2004 primarily were due to: • Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream segments. • Improved refining margins in our R&M segment. • Equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. In addition, the improved results in 2005 also reflected our equity share of DEFS’ sale of its general partner interest in TEPPCO. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results. Income Statement Analysis 2005 vs. 2004 Sales and other operating revenues increased 33 percent in 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 39 percent. These increases primarily were due to higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. At its September 2005 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which encompasses our buy/sell transactions, and will impact our reported revenues and purchase costs. The EITF concluded that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty in the same line of business should be recorded net and accounted for as nonmonetary exchanges if they are entered into “in contemplation” of one another. The new guidance is effective prospectively beginning April 1, 2006, for 54 new arrangements entered into, and for modifications or renewals of existing arrangements. Had this new guidance been effective for the periods included in this report, and depending on the determination of what transactions are affected by the new guidance, we would have been required to reduce sales and other operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003 by $21,814 million, $15,492 million and $11,673 million, respectively, with related decreases in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 125 percent in 2005. The increase reflects a full year’s equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: • Our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil prices and higher production volumes at Hamaca. • Our chemicals joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins. • Our midstream joint venture, DEFS, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices and DEFS’ gain on the sale of its TEPPCO general partner interest. • Our joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. • Our joint-venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials. Other income increased 52 percent in 2005. The increase was mainly due to higher net gains on asset dispositions in 2005, as well as higher interest income. Asset dispositions in 2005 included the sale of our interest in coalbed methane acreage positions in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, as well as our interests in Dixie Pipeline, Turcas Petrol A.S., and Venture Coke Company. Asset dispositions in 2004 included our interest in the Petrovera heavy-oil joint venture in Canada. Production and operating expenses increased 16 percent in 2005. The E&P segment had higher maintenance and transportation costs; higher costs associated with new fields, including the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico; negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates; and upward insurance premium adjustments. The R&M segment had higher utility costs due to higher natural gas prices, as well as higher maintenance and repair costs due to increased turnaround activity and hurricane impacts. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 12 percent in 2005, primarily due to new projects in the E&P segment, including a full year’s production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp-up at the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (FIN 47), effective December 31, 2005. As a result, we recognized a charge of $88 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event and if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. 55 2004 vs. 2003 Sales and other operating revenues increased 30 percent in 2004, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 34 percent. These increases mainly were due to: • Higher petroleum products prices. • Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. • Increased volumes of natural gas bought and sold by our Commercial organization in its role of optimizing the commodity flows of our E&P segment. • Higher excise, value added and other similar taxes. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 183 percent in 2004. The increase reflects initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: • Our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela, due to higher crude oil prices and higher production volumes. • CPChem, due to higher volumes and margins. • DEFS, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. • Our joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. • Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials. Interest and debt expense declined 35 percent in 2004. The decrease primarily was due to lower average debt levels during 2004 and an increased amount of interest being capitalized on major capital projects. During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our E&P Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 5—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. We adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) effective January 1, 2003. As a result, we recognized a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46(R)) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. We recognized a net $95 million charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of these two accounting changes. 56 Segment Results E&P 2005 2004 2003 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 2,552 1,832 1,445 Lower 48 1,736 1,110 929 United States 4,288 2,942 2,374 International 4,142 2,760 1,928 $ 8,430 5,702 4,302 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 51.09 38.25 28.85 International 52.27 37.18 28.27 Total consolidated 51.74 37.65 28.54 Equity affiliates* 37.79 24.18 19.01 Worldwide E&P 49.87 36.06 27.52 Natural gas—lease (per thousand cubic feet) United States 7.12 5.33 4.67 International 5.78 4.14 3.69 Total consolidated 6.32 4.62 4.08 Equity affiliates* .26 2.19 4.44 Worldwide E&P 6.30 4.61 4.08 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent** United States $ 4.24 3.70 3.60 International 4.73 3.96 3.88 Total consolidated 4.51 3.85 3.76 Equity affiliates* 4.93 4.14 4.16 Worldwide E&P 4.55 3.87 3.78 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 312 286 301 Leasehold impairment 116 175 133 Dry holes 233 242 167 $ 661 703 601 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. **2004 and 2003 restated to exclude production, property and similar taxes. 57 2005 2004 2003 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Crude oil produced Alaska 294 298 325 Lower 48 59 51 54 United States 353 349 379 European North Sea 257 271 290 Asia Pacific 100 94 61 Canada 23 25 30 Middle East and Africa 53 58 69 Other areas — — 3 Total consolidated 786 797 832 Equity affiliates* 121 108 102 907 905 934 Natural gas liquids produced Alaska 20 23 23 Lower 48 30 26 25 United States 50 49 48 European North Sea 13 14 9 Asia Pacific 16 9 — Canada 10 10 10 Middle East and Africa 2 2 2 91 84 69 Millions of Cubic Feet Daily Natural gas produced** Alaska 169 165 184 Lower 48 1,212 1,223 1,295 United States 1,381 1,388 1,479 European North Sea 1,023 1,119 1,215 Asia Pacific 350 301 318 Canada 425 433 435 Middle East and Africa 84 71 63 Total consolidated 3,263 3,312 3,510 Equity affiliates* 7 5 12 3,270 3,317 3,522 Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 19 21 19 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. **Represents quantities available for sale. Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids shown above. 58 The E&P segment explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2005, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the E&P segment increased 48 percent in 2005. The increase primarily was due to higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes associated with the Magnolia and Bayu-Undan fields, as well as the Hamaca project, contributed positively to net income in 2005. Partially offsetting these items were increased production and operating costs, DD&A and taxes, as well as mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2006 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2005, E&P’s earnings would be negatively impacted. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices. Proved reserves at year-end 2005 were 7.92 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.61 billion BOE at year-end 2004. This excludes the estimated 1,442 million BOE and 880 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2005 and 2004, respectively. Also excluded, our Canadian Syncrude mining operations reported 251 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at year-end 2005, compared with 258 million barrels at year-end 2004. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the E&P segment increased 33 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Increased sales prices were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production, as well as higher exploration expenses and lower net gains on asset dispositions. The 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)), as well as benefits of $233 million from changes in certain international income tax and site restoration laws, and equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Included in 2004 is a $72 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change. U.S. E&P 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 46 percent in 2005. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher sales volumes from the Magnolia deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in late 2004; and higher gains from asset sales in 2005. These items were partially offset by: • Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased transportation costs and well workover and other maintenance activity, and the impact of newly producing fields and environmental accruals. 59 • Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Magnolia field and other new fields. • Higher production taxes, resulting from increased prices for crude oil and natural gas. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 633,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 629,000 barrels per day in 2004. The slight increase reflects the positive impact of a full year’s production from the Magnolia field and the purchase of overriding royalty interests in the Utah and San Juan basins, mostly offset by normal field production declines, hurricane-related downtime, and the impact of asset dispositions. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 24 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase was mainly the result of higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes and lower net gains on asset dispositions. In addition, the 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)). U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 629,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 7 percent from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. The decreased production primarily was the result of the impact of 2003 asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance activities during 2004. International E&P 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from our international E&P operations increased 50 percent in 2005. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. In addition, we had higher sales volumes from the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea and the Hamaca project in Venezuela. These items were partially offset by: • Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased costs at our Canadian Syncrude operations (including higher utility costs there) and increased costs associated with newly producing fields. • Mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. • Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Bayu-Undan field. • Higher income taxes incurred by our equity affiliates at our Venezuelan heavy-oil projects. International E&P production averaged 910,000 BOE per day in 2005, a slight decrease from 913,000 BOE per day in 2004. Production was favorably impacted in 2005 by the Bayu-Undan field and the Hamaca heavy-oil upgrader project. At the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea, 2005 production was higher than that in 2004, when production was still ramping up. At the Hamaca project in Venezuela, production increased in late 2004 with the startup of a heavy-oil upgrader. These increases in production were offset by the impact of planned and unplanned maintenance, and field production declines. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2004. 60 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our international E&P operations increased 43 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher natural gas liquids volumes. Higher prices were partially offset by increased exploration expenses. International E&P’s net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items: • In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed, which resulted in a net after-tax benefit of $87 million. • In the Timor Sea region, a broad ownership interest re-alignment among the co-venturers in the Bayu-Undan project and certain deferred tax adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $51 million. • In Canada, the Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers, which resulted in a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability. International E&P production averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000 BOE per day in 2003. Production was favorably impacted in 2004 by the startup of production from the Su Tu Den field in Vietnam in late 2003, the ramp-up of liquids production from the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the startup of the Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela in the fourth quarter of 2004. These items were more than offset by the impact of asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2003.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas 61 liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. In July 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective ownership levels in DEFS, which resulted in DEFS becoming a jointly controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. Prior to the restructuring, our ownership interest in DEFS was 30.3 percent. This restructuring increased our ownership in DEFS through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain Canadian Midstream assets from DEFS to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution from DEFS to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ interest in TEPPCO, and a combined payment by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DEFS of approximately $840 million. The Empress plant in Canada was not included in the initial transaction as originally anticipated due to weather-related damage. Subsequently, we sold the Empress plant to Duke in August 2005 for approximately $230 million. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 193 percent in 2005. Included in the Midstream segment’s 2005 net income is our share of a gain from DEFS’ sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO. Our share of this gain, reflected in equity in earnings of affiliates, was $306 million, after-tax. In addition to this gain, our Midstream segment benefited from improved natural gas liquids prices in 2005, which increased earnings at DEFS, as well as our other Midstream operations. These positive items were partially offset by the loss of earnings from asset dispositions completed in 2004 and 2005. Included in the Midstream segment’s net income was a benefit of $17 million in 2005, compared with $36 million in 2004, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. The reduced amount in 2005 resulted from a significant reduction in the favorable basis difference of our investment in DEFS following the restructuring. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 81 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The improvement was primarily attributable to improved results from DEFS, which had: • Higher gross margins, primarily reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. • A $23 million (gross) charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, mainly related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143; partially offset by investment impairments and write-downs of assets held for sale during 2004. Our Midstream operations outside of DEFS had higher earnings in 2004 as well, reflecting the impact of higher natural gas liquids prices that more than offset the effect of asset dispositions in 2004. Included in the Midstream segment’s net income was a benefit of $36 million in 2004, the same as 2003, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 62 R&M 2005 2004 2003 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 3,329 2,126 990 International 844 617 282 $ 4,173 2,743 1,272 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 1.73 1.33 1.05 Retail 1.88 1.52 1.35 Distillates—wholesale 1.80 1.24 .92 *Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2005 and 2004 was 2,182,000 and 2,160,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 428,000 barrels per day internationally. 63 The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the R&M segment increased 52 percent in 2005, primarily due to higher worldwide refining margins. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for our view of the factors that supported the improved refining margins during 2005. Higher refining margins were partially offset by: • Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. • Increased turnaround costs. • Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. • An $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. If refining margins decline in 2006 from the historically strong levels experienced in 2005, we would expect a corresponding decrease in R&M’s earnings. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the R&M segment increased 116 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher refining margins. This was partially offset by lower U.S. marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change (FIN 46(R)). U.S. R&M 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 57 percent in 2005. The increase mainly was the result of higher U.S. refining margins, partially offset by: • Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. • Increased turnaround costs. • Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. • A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2005, compared with 95 percent in 2004. The 2005 rate was impacted by downtime related to hurricanes. Specifically, the Sweeny, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, refineries were shutdown in advance of Hurricane Rita. The Sweeny refinery returned to full operation by October. The Lake Charles refinery resumed operations in mid-October, and returned to full operation in November. The Alliance refinery in Belle Chase, Louisiana, was shutdown in advance 64 of Hurricane Katrina, and suffered flooding and damage from that storm. The refinery began partial operation in late-January 2006, and is expected to return to full operation around the end of the first quarter of 2006. Effective January 1, 2005, the crude oil capacity at our Sweeny, Texas, refinery was increased by 13,000 barrels per day, as a result of incremental debottlenecking. Effective April 1, 2005, we increased the crude oil processing capacity at our San Francisco, California, refinery by 9,000 barrels per day as a result of a project implementation related to clean fuels. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 115 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change (FIN 46(R)). Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2004, compared with 96 percent in 2003. The lower capacity utilization was due to increased maintenance downtime. International R&M 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from our international R&M operations increased 37 percent in 2005, primarily due to higher refining margins, along with improved refinery production volumes and increased results from marketing. These factors were partially offset by negative foreign currency exchange impacts and higher utility costs. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 99 percent in 2005, compared with 91 percent in 2004. A larger volume of turnaround activity in 2004 contributed to most of this variance. In November 2005, we executed a definitive agreement for the cash purchase of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. The purchase would include the 275,000-barrel-per-day refinery, a marine terminal, rail and truck loading facilities and a tank farm, as well as another entity that provides commercial and administrative support to the refinery. The purchase is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2006, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including obtaining the necessary governmental approvals and regulatory permits. The addition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery would increase our overall European refining capacity by approximately 74 percent, from 372,000 barrels per day to 647,000 barrels per day. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the international R&M operations increased 119 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, with the improvement primarily attributable to higher refining margins, partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts on operating costs. 65 LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Net Income $ 714 74 — Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 235 38 — Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 67 13 — Net refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 122 19 — *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s ordinary shares held by the Russian government, and during the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10.0 percent. During 2005, we expended $2,160 million to further increase our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. Purchase of LUKOIL shares continued into the first quarter of 2006. The 2005 results for the LUKOIL Investment segment reflect favorable market conditions, including strong crude oil prices. In addition to our estimate of our equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs associated with the employees seconded to LUKOIL. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment include an estimate for the latest quarter presented in a period. This estimate is based on market indicators, historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors. Differences between the estimate and actual results are recorded in a subsequent period. This process may create volatility in quarterly trend analysis for this segment, but this volatility will be mitigated when viewing this segment’s results over an annual or longer time frame. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Net Income $ 323 249 7 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane. 66 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 30 percent in 2005. The increase primarily was attributable to higher margins in the ethylene and polyethylene lines of business. Ethylene margins improved for the second consecutive year and, coupled with the increase in polyethylene margins, indicates that these business lines have improved from a deep cyclical downturn that began in the 1999/2000 time frame. Partially offsetting these margin improvements were higher utility costs, reflecting increased costs of natural gas, as well as hurricane-related impacts on production and maintenance and repair costs. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased $242 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase reflects that CPChem had improved equity earnings from Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), an olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar, and Saudi Chevron Phillips Company, an aromatics complex in Saudi Arabia. Results from CPChem’s consolidated operations also improved due to higher ethylene and benzene margins, as well as increased ethylene, polyethylene and normal alpha olefins sales volumes. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Net Income (Loss) Technology solutions $ (16 ) (18 ) (20 ) Gas-to-liquids (23 ) (33 ) (50 ) Power 43 (31 ) (5 ) Other (25 ) (20 ) (24 ) $ (21 ) (102 ) (99 ) The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations. These activities include gas-to-liquids (GTL) operations, power generation, technology solutions such as sulfur removal technologies, and emerging technologies, such as renewable fuels and emission management technologies. 2005 vs. 2004 The Emerging Businesses segment incurred a net loss of $21 million in 2005, compared with a net loss of $102 million in 2004. The improved results in 2005 reflect: • The first full year of operations at the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom. The plant commenced commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2004. • Lower costs in the gas-to-liquids business, reflecting the shut down in June 2005 of a demonstration plant in Ponca City, Oklahoma. • Improved margins in the domestic power generation business. 67 2004 vs. 2003 Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $102 million in 2004, compared with a net loss of $99 million in 2003. Contributing to the higher losses in 2004 were lower domestic power margins and higher maintenance costs, as well as increased costs associated with the Immingham power plant project in the United Kingdom, which entered the initial commissioning phase during 2004. Prior to the initial commissioning phase, most costs associated with this project were construction activities and thus capitalized. This project completed the initial commissioning phase and began commercial operations in October 2004. Partially offsetting these items were lower research and development costs, compared with 2003, which included the costs of a demonstration GTL plant then under construction. Construction of the GTL plant was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2003. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2005 2004 2003 Net Income (Loss) Net interest $ (422 ) (514 ) (632 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (183 ) (212 ) (173 ) Discontinued operations (23 ) 22 237 Merger-related costs — (14 ) (223 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes — — (112 )* Other (150 ) (54 ) 26 $ (778 ) (772 ) (877 ) *Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations, primarily related to the adoption of FIN 46(R). 2005 vs. 2004 After-tax net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2005, primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income. Interest income increased as a result of our higher average cash balances during 2005. These items were partially offset by increased early debt retirement fees and a lower amount of interest being capitalized in 2005, reflecting the completion of several major projects in the second half of 2004. After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 14 percent in 2005. The decrease reflects increased allocations of management-level stock-based compensation to the operating segments, which had previously been retained at corporate. These increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments’ results. This was partially offset by increased charitable contributions, reflecting disaster relief following the southeast Asia tsunami and Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. Discontinued operations net income declined in 2005, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2004 and 2005. The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand-alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were lower in 2005, mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction impacts. 68 2004 vs. 2003 Net interest decreased 19 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt levels, an increased amount of interest being capitalized in 2004, lower charges for premiums paid on the early retirement of debt, and lower costs associated with the receivables monetization program. After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased 23 percent in 2004. The increase reflects higher compensation costs, which includes increased stock-based compensation due to an increase in both the number of units issued and higher stock prices in the 2004 period. Discontinued operations net income declined 91 percent in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2003 and 2004. Results from Other were lower in 2004, mainly due to the inclusion in the 2003 period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits, negative foreign currency transaction impacts, higher environmental costs and increased minority interest expense. 69 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2005 2004 2003 Current ratio .9 1.0 .8 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,628 11,959 9,356 Notes payable and long-term debt due within one year $ 1,758 632 1,440 Total debt $ 12,516 15,002 17,780 Minority interests $ 1,209 1,105 842 Common stockholders’ equity $ 52,731 42,723 34,366 Percent of total debt to capital* 19 % 26 34 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 9 % 19 17 *Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders’ equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2005 we raised $768 million in funds from the sale of assets. During 2005, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repay debt, pay dividends and purchase shares of our common stock. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2005 were $1.6 billion. During 2005, cash and cash equivalents increased $827 million to $2.2 billion. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, as well as our $5 billion universal shelf registration statement, to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We anticipate that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2007, including our capital spending program and required debt payments. We anticipate that the cash portion of the pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., approximately $17.5 billion, will be financed with a combination of short- and long-term debt and available cash. For additional information about the acquisition, see Note 28—Pending Acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2003 through 2005. Favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. Excluding the Burlington Resources acquisition and absent any unusual event during 2006, we expect that market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2006 operating cash flows, when compared with 2005. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2005, cash of $17,628 million was provided by operating activities, compared with cash from operations of $11,959 million in 2004. This 47 percent increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and a positive impact from working capital changes, partly offset by a greater amount of undistributed equity earnings. 70 • Income from continuing operations increased $5,533 million, compared with 2004, primarily as a result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices, as well as improved worldwide refining margins. • Working capital changes increased cash flow by $847 million when comparing 2005 and 2004. Contributing to the increase in cash flow from working capital changes were higher increases in accounts payable in 2005, resulting from higher commodity prices and increased capital spending. • Undistributed equity earnings increased $997 million in 2005 over 2004, as a result of higher equity in earnings of affiliates that have not been distributed to owners. During 2004, cash flow from operations increased $2,603 million to $11,959 million. Contributing to the improvement, compared with 2003, was an increase in income from continuing operations primarily resulting from higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as improved worldwide refining margins. This benefit was partly offset by a higher retained interest in receivables sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE). For additional information on receivables sold to a QSPE, see Receivables Monetization in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Our cash flows from operating activities for both the short- and long-term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2004 and 2005, we benefited from historically high crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as strong refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control. In addition, the level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved reserves. We will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of new fields, or by acquisition, and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves. We have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and, although it cannot be assured, anticipate being able to do so in the future. Including the impact of our equity investments and after adjusting our 2003 production for assets sold in 2003 and early 2004, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three years. Going forward, based on our 2005 production level of 1.79 million BOE per day, we expect our annual production growth to average in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent over the five-year period ending in 2010. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp-up in those years, exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations, and do not include any impact from our pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. Including the impact of our equity investments, our reserve replacement over the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, exceeded 100 percent. Contributing to our success during this three-year period were proved reserves added through our investment in LUKOIL, other purchases of reserves in place, and extensions and discoveries. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three-year period, 2006 through 2008. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects. It does not include any impact from our pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2005 and 2003, revisions increased our reserves, while in 2004, revisions 71 decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 44 percent, 38 percent and 76 percent of our total net additions in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 16 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at December 31, 2005, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be approximately 15 percent. For additional information related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, see the discussion under the E&P section of Capital Spending. The anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks, including reservoir performance; operational downtime; finding and development execution; obtaining management, Board and third-party approval of development projects in a timely manner; regulatory changes; geographical location; market prices; and environmental issues; and therefore, cannot be assured. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2005 were $768 million. Following the merger of Conoco and Phillips in August 2002, we initiated an asset disposition program. Our ultimate target was to raise approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2004. During 2004, proceeds from asset sales were $1.6 billion, bringing total proceeds at the end of 2004 to approximately $5.0 billion since the program began. Proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities During 2005, we replaced our $2.5 billion four-year revolving credit facility that would have expired in October 2008 and our $2.5 billion five-year facility that would have expired in October 2009 with two new revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion. Both new facilities expire in October 2010. The new facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for the ConocoPhillips $5 billion commercial paper program, the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, and could be used to support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements do contain a cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated subsidiaries’, failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2005. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2005, we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program, compared with $544 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004. In December 2005, ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. initiated a $1.5 billion commercial paper program to be used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2005, commercial paper outstanding under this program was $32 million. Since we had $32 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $62 million of letters of credit, we had access to $4.9 billion in borrowing capacity under the two revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2005. In addition, our $2.2 billion cash balance also supported our liquidity position. 72 At December 31, 2005, Moody’s Investor Service had a rating of A1 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of A-. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $5 billion revolving credit facilities. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we have available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of debt and equity securities. Minority Interests At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $1,209 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $507 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to controlled-operating joint ventures with minority interest owners. The largest of these, $682 million, was related to the Bayu-Undan liquefied natural gas project in the Timor Sea and northern Australia. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2005, was 5.37 percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2005, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2005, Ashford held $1.8 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Monetization At December 31, 2004, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) in a revolving-period securitization arrangement. The arrangement provided for ConocoPhillips to sell, and the QSPE to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities. At December 31, 2004, the QSPE had issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored entities of $480 million. All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have held no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities, which we have not consolidated. Furthermore, except as discussed below, we have not consolidated the QSPE because it has met the 73 requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips. The receivables transferred to the QSPE have met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and have been accounted for accordingly. By January 31, 2005, all of the beneficial interests held by the bank-sponsored entities had matured; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 140, the operating results and cash flows of the QSPE subsequent to this maturity have been consolidated in our financial statements. The revolving-period securitization arrangement was terminated on August 31, 2005, and at this time, we have no plans to renew the arrangement. See Note 13—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Preferred Securities In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust. The sole purpose of the trust was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The trust was established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities. We made interest payments of $29 million in both 2005 and 2004. In addition, we guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. When we redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities. See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 17—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Affiliated Companies As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2005, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. • Hamaca: The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt in Venezuela. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and Chevron Corporation. Our interest is held through a jointly owned limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Our equity in earnings from Hamaca Holding LLC in 2005 was $473 million. We have a 57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. In 2001, we along with our co-venturers in the Hamaca project secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17-year term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14-year term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $856 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2005. Of this amount, $342 million was recourse to ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings were used to primarily fund a heavy-oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding was provided by capital contributions from the co-venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. 74 Although the original guaranteed project completion date of October 1, 2005, was extended because of force majeure events that occurred during the construction period, completion certification was achieved on January 9, 2006, and the project financings became non-recourse with respect to the co-venturers. The lenders under the joint financing facilities may now look only to the Hamaca project’s cash flows for payment. • Qatargas 3: Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, which is expected to be December 31, 2009, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non-recourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2005, Qatargas 3 had $120 million outstanding under all the loan facilities, $36 million of which was loaned by ConocoPhillips. • Other: At December 31, 2005, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 20 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was approximately $190 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $96 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2005, was $12.5 billion. This reflects debt reductions of approximately $2.5 billion during 2005. The decline in debt primarily resulted from a reduction of $512 million in our commercial paper balance; the redemption in November of our $750 million 6.35% Notes due 2009, at a premium of $42 million plus accrued interest; the redemption in late March of our $400 million 3.625% Notes due 2007, at par plus accrued interest; and the purchase, at market prices, and retirement of $752 million of various ConocoPhillips bond issues. In conjunction with the redemption of the 6.35% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, $750 million and $400 million, respectively, of interest rate swaps were cancelled. The note redemptions, interest rate swap cancellations, and bond issue purchases resulted in after-tax losses of $92 million. 75 On February 4, August 11, and November 15, 2005, we announced separate stock repurchase programs, each of which provides for the purchase of up to $1 billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years. Acquisitions for the share repurchase programs are made at management’s discretion at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the programs are held as treasury shares. During 2005, we purchased 32.1 million shares of our common stock, at a cost of $1.9 billion under the programs. We entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of the facilities. This financing will represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing. Through December 31, 2005, we had provided $36 million in loan financing. See the “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section for additional information on Qatargas 3. In July 2004, we announced the finalization of our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $630 million for the construction of the facility. Through December 31, 2005, we had provided $212 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. Production from the NMNG joint-venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL intends to complete an expansion of the terminal oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day to up to 240,000 barrels per day in late 2007, with ConocoPhillips participating in the design and financing of the terminal expansion. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. Based on preliminary budget estimates from the operator, we expect our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to be approximately $330 million. This amount will be adjusted as the design is finalized and the expansion project proceeds. Through December 31, 2005, we had provided $61 million in loan financing. We account for our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey Terminal Company as financial assets in the “Investments and long-term receivables” line on the balance sheet. In February 2006, we announced a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, representing a 16 percent increase over the previous quarter’s dividend of 31 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2006, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 21, 2006. 76 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2005: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period At December 31, 2005 Total Up to 1 Year Year 2-3 Year 4-5 After 5 Years Debt obligations* $ 12,469 1,751 240 1,673 8,805 Capital lease obligations 47 7 36 4 — Total debt 12,516 1,758 276 1,677 8,805 Operating lease obligations 2,618 494 766 467 891 Purchase obligations** 85,932 33,370 7,884 5,507 39,171 Other long-term liabilities*** Asset retirement obligations 3,901 100 359 358 3,084 Accrued environmental costs 989 199 235 137 418 Total $ 105,956 35,921 9,520 8,146 52,369 * Total debt excluding capital lease obligations. Includes net unamortized premiums and discounts. ** Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $50,744 million, of which $18,276 million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $10,649 million primarily related to natural gas for resale to customers, $9,664 million primarily related to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $3,327 million related to transportation, $3,763 million related to product purchase, $2,142 million of futures, $2,114 million related to power trades and $809 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $30,126 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 95 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co-owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of Petrozuata crude oil for a market-based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 14-year term if a variety of conditions are met. *** Does not include: (1) Taxes—the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production, payroll and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $3,516 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions—for the 2006 through 2010 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $365 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $130 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $420 million for the next three years and then approximately $275 million per year as our pension plans become better funded. Our required minimum funding in 2006 is expected to be $65 million in the United States and $95 million outside the United States; and (3) Interest—we anticipate payments of $793 million in 2006, $1,387 million for the period 2007 through 2008, $1,288 million for the period 2009 through 2010, and $7,164 million for the remaining years to total $10,632 million. 77 Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2006 Budget* 2005 2004 2003 E&P United States—Alaska $ 861 746 645 570 United States—Lower 48 949 891 669 848 International 5,663 5,047 3,935 3,090 7,473 6,684 5,249 4,508 Midstream 6 839 7 10 R&M United States 1,820 1,537 1,026 860 International 1,671 201 318 319 3,491 1,738 1,344 1,179 LUKOIL Investment** — 2,160 2,649 — Chemicals — — — — Emerging Businesses 26 5 75 284 Corporate and Other*** 217 194 172 188 $ 11,213 11,620 9,496 6,169 United States $ 3,856 4,207 2,520 2,493 International 7,357 7,413 6,976 3,676 $ 11,213 11,620 9,496 6,169 Discontinued operations $ — — 1 224 * Does not include any amounts for the pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. ** Discretionary expenditures in 2006 for potential additional equity investment in LUKOIL to increase our ownership percentage up to 20 percent, from 16.1 percent at December 31, 2005, are not included in our 2006 budget amounts. *** Excludes discontinued operations. Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, totaled $27.3 billion, including a combined $4.8 billion in 2004 through 2005 relating to our purchase of a 16.1 percent interest in LUKOIL. During the three-year period, spending was primarily focused on the growth of our E&P segment, with 60 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. Excluding discretionary expenditures for potential additional investment in LUKOIL, our capital budget for 2006 is $11.2 billion. Included in this amount are $447 million in capitalized interest and $44 million that is expected to be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export project. We plan to direct approximately 67 percent of our 2006 capital budget to E&P and 31 percent to R&M. E&P Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, totaled $16.4 billion. The expenditures over the three-year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: • The West Sak and Alpine projects and drilling of National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and satellite field prospects on Alaska’s North Slope. • Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 78 • The acquisition of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. • Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project and development of the Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada. • The Hamaca heavy-oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt. • The Ekofisk Area growth project and Alvheim project in the Norwegian North Sea. • The Clair, CMS3, Saturn and Britannia satellite developments in the United Kingdom. • The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the North Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan, including additional ownership interest. • The acquisition of an interest in OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL. • The Bayu-Undan gas recycle and liquefied natural gas development projects in the Timor Sea and northern Australia. • The Belanak, Suban, South Jambi, Kerisi and Hiu projects in Indonesia. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects. • Development projects in Block 15-1 and Block 15-2 in Vietnam. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pump stations and purchase of an additional interest in the pipeline, were also included in the E&P segment. UNITED STATES Alaska During the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, we made capital expenditures for the construction of double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. We expect the fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker to be in Alaska North Slope service in 2006, although contractual and hurricane-related issues may further delay delivery of this vessel. We continued development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine field, including Alpine’s first satellite fields—Nanuq and Fiord, and the West Sak development. In addition, we completed both Phase I and Phase II of the Alpine Capacity Expansion project. We also participated in exploratory drilling on the North Slope and acquired additional acreage during this three-year period. During 2004, we and our co-venturers in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade the pipeline’s pump stations that is expected to be fully complete in 2006. Lower 48 States In the Lower 48, we continued to explore or develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, we began production in late 2004 from the Magnolia field, where development drilling continued in 2005. We also began production from the K2 field in Green Canyon Block 562 in May 2005. 79 Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas, and the acquisition in 2005 of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. CANADA In Canada, we continued with development of the Syncrude Stage III expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, where an upgrader expansion project is expected to be fully operational in mid-2006. We also continued with development of the Surmont heavy-oil project. During 2005, funds were also invested to acquire an additional 6.5 percent interest in Surmont, increasing our interest to 50 percent. Over the life of this 30+ year project, we anticipate that approximately 500 production and steam-injection well pairs will be drilled. In 2005, our capital expenditures associated with the development of the Surmont project, excluding the acquisition of the additional interest, were approximately $93 million. In addition, capital expenditures were also focused on the development of our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves in western Canada. SOUTH AMERICA At our Hamaca project in Venezuela, construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium-grade crude oil became fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the Gulf of Paria, funds were invested to construct a floating storage offtake facility and to construct and install a wellhead platform in the Corocoro field. The Corocoro drilling program is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2006. NORTHWEST EUROPE In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, where production began in the fourth quarter of 2005; the U.K. Clair field, where production began in early 2005; the Saturn project, where production began in the third quarter of 2005; the CMS3 area, comprising five natural gas fields in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea, where the final field began production in 2004; the Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2007; and the Alvheim development project, where production is scheduled to begin in 2007. AFRICA In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. Funding was also provided for our share of the basic phase of the Brass liquefied natural gas (LNG) project for the front-end engineering and design and related activities to move the project to a final investment decision. 80 RUSSIA AND CASPIAN SEA Russia In June 2005, we invested funds of $512 million to acquire a 30 percent economic interest and a 50 percent voting interest in NMNG, a joint venture with LUKOIL to explore for and develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. The June acquisition price was based on preliminary estimates of capital expenditures and working capital. The purchase price is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2006. Caspian Sea Construction activities began in 2004 to develop the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the North Caspian Sea. Additional exploratory drilling through 2004 has resulted in the discovery of a total of five fields in the area. In March 2005, agreement was reached with the Republic of Kazakhstan government to conclude the sale of BG International’s interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement to several of the remaining partners and for the subsequent sale of one-half of the acquired interests to KazMunayGas. This agreement increased our ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 9.26 percent. ASIA PACIFIC Timor Sea In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with Phase I of the Bayu-Undan project, where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed, and the dry gas re-injected into the reservoir. Production of liquids began from Phase I in February of 2004, and development drilling concluded at the end of March 2005. In June 2003, we received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority for Phase II, the development of an LNG plant near Darwin, Australia, as well as a gas pipeline from Bayu-Undan to the LNG facility. Construction activities continued through 2005, and the first LNG cargo from the facility was loaded in February 2006. Indonesia In Indonesia, funds were used for the completion of the Belanak field in the South Natuna Sea Block B, including the construction of the Belanak floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility and associated gas plant facilities on the FPSO. Oil production began from Belanak in late 2004 and first condensate production and gas exports began in June and October 2005, respectively. Also, in Block B we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields. In South Sumatra, following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement in August 2004, we began the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant. Also in South Sumatra, we completed the construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project in the South Jambi B Block, where first production began in June 2004. China Following approval from the Chinese government in early 2005, we began development of Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25-6 field. The development of Peng Lai 19-3 and Peng Lai 25-6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility. 81 Vietnam In Vietnam’s Block 15-1, funds were invested for the Su Tu Den Phase I southwest area development project, where production began in the fourth quarter of 2003 and where water injection facilities were put into service in 2004. Also in Block 15-1, preliminary engineering for the nearby Su Tu Vang development began in early 2005, and approval for the development was obtained in late 2005. On Block 15-2, we upgraded facilities at our producing Rang Dong field in 2003 and continued further development of the field, including the central part of the field, where two additional platforms and additional production and injection wells were completed in the third quarter of 2005. 2006 Capital Budget E&P’s 2006 capital budget is $7.5 billion, 12 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2005. Twenty-four percent of E&P’s 2006 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 48 percent of that slated for Alaska. We plan to spend $861 million in 2006 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations—including two Alpine satellites and West Sak field developments, construction to complete our fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker, and exploration activities. In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the Ursa field and the completion of the K2 and Magnolia developments in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. E&P is directing $5.7 billion of its 2006 capital budget to international projects, including payments for the acquisition of an interest in our former oil and gas production operations in Libya. The agreement for our return was signed and approved by the Libyan government in late-December 2005. In addition, funds in 2006 also will be directed to developing major long-term projects, including the Bayu-Undan gas development project in the Timor Sea; the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the NMNG joint venture in northern Russia; the Britannia satellites, Ekofisk Area growth and Alvheim projects in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; the Syncrude expansion, Surmont heavy-oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas projects in Canada; the Belanak, Kerisi-Hiu and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar. In late-December 2005, we announced that, in conjunction with our co-venturers, we reached agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation on the terms under which we would return to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. ConocoPhillips and Marathon each hold a 16.33 percent interest, Amerada Hess holds an 8.16 percent interest, and the Libyan National Oil Corporation holds the remaining 59.16 percent interest. The fiscal terms of the agreement are similar to the terms in effect at the time of the suspension of the co-venturers’ activities in 1986. The terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions to 2031-2034; a payment to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $1.3 billion ($520 million net to ConocoPhillips) for the acquisition of an ownership interest in, and extension of, the concessions; and a contribution to unamortized investments made since 1986 of $530 million ($212 million net to ConocoPhillips) that were agreed to be paid as part of the 1986 standstill agreement to hold the assets in escrow for the U.S.-based co-venturers. Of the total amount to be paid by ConocoPhillips, $520 million was paid in January 2006, and the remaining $212 million is expected to be paid in December 2006. 82 PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $3.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 16 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Although it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2006 through 2008 are projected to be $2.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively. Of our 2,515 million BOE proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2005, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three-year period ending 2008 will be approximately 15 percent. Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2005 were associated with nine major developments and our investment in LUKOIL. Seven of the major developments are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: • The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. • The Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Heidrun fields in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea. • Natural gas and crude oil fields in Indonesia. The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. Midstream Capital spending for continuing operations for Midstream during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DEFS in 2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. R&M Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, and the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending for continuing operations was $4.3 billion, representing 16 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Completion of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit and an S ZorbÔ Sulfur Removal Technology (S-Zorb) unit at the Ferndale refinery. • A low sulfur gasoline project at the Ponca City refinery. • Phase I of a low sulfur gasoline project at the Wood River refinery. • A new S-Zorb unit at the Lake Charles refinery. • A new FCC gasoline hydrotreater at the Alliance refinery. • An expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude-oil pipeline. • Integration of a crude unit and coker adjacent to our Wood River refinery. • A new hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. 83 The integration of the crude unit and coker purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery enables the refinery to process additional heavier, lower-cost crude oil. The new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery became operational at the end of March 2005. The new diesel hydrotreater provides the capability to produce reformulated California highway diesel over one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In November 2005, we announced the planned acquisition of the 275,000-barrel-per-day Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. The purchase is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2006. 2006 Capital Budget R&M’s 2006 capital budget is $3.5 billion, a 101 percent increase over actual spending in 2005. Domestic spending is expected to consume 52 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $1.5 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, of which approximately $400 million is earmarked for clean fuels projects already in progress and about $700 million is for sustaining projects related to reliability, safety and the environment. In addition, about $400 million is intended for strategic and other investments to increase crude oil capacity, expand conversion capability, improve energy efficiency and increase clean product yield. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $275 million. Internationally, we plan to spend approximately $1.7 billion on our R&M operations. Of this amount, about $1.4 billion is intended for the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany, including the initial expenditures for a deep conversion project and other improvements at the refinery. The remaining international R&M capital budget is for projects to strengthen our existing assets within Europe and Asia. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October 2004. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial statements. 84 Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. • Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. • Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. • Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. 85 For example, the EPA has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in June 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting non-road diesel fuel sulfur content. The non-road rule, as promulgated in June 2004, significantly reduces non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non-road markets. Additional areas of potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. The EPA responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new eight-hour NAAQS on April 30, 2004. Several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule. Depending upon the outcomes of the various challenges, area designations, and the resulting State Implementation Plans, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us. In recent action, the EPA has proposed an even more stringent particulate-matter standard and continues to consider increased stringency for ozone requirements as well. Outcomes of the deliberations remain indeterminate. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future ratify, support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions reduction programs. Other countries where we have interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. Because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, it currently is not possible to accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the Kyoto Protocol, but they could be substantial. The Kyoto Protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in February 2005. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. 86 We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2004, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 64 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2005, we had resolved five of these sites, reclassified one site, and had received six new notices of potential liability, leaving 66 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $847 million in 2005 and are expected to be about $790 million in 2006 and $850 million in 2007. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,235 million in 2005 and are expected to be about $1,000 million and $630 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Remediation Accruals We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2005. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. 87 At December 31, 2005, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs related to continuing operations of $989 million, compared with $1,061 million at December 31, 2004. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” Among other changes, this Statement requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractical to do so. Guidance is provided on how to account for changes when retrospective application is impractical. This Statement is effective on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS 123(R)), which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the beginning of 2003. SFAS 123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements, including options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and generally requires the fair value of share-based awards to be expensed. For ConocoPhillips, this Statement provided for an effective date of third-quarter 2005; however, in April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule that delayed the effective date until January 1, 2006. We adopted the provisions of this Statement on January 1, 2006, using the modified-prospective transition method, and do not expect the provisions of this new pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements. For more information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This Statement clarifies that items, such as abnormal idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and handling costs, be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, the Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We are required to implement this Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect this Statement to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 88 At the September 2005 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which addresses accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same line of business. For additional information, see the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. At year-end 2005, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was approximately $512 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was approximately 89 $167 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 72 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.9 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2006 would increase by $6 million. The remaining $2,688 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2005 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion is concentrated in nine major projects. Except for Surmont, which is scheduled to begin production in late 2006, management expects less than $100 million to move to proved properties in 2006. Most of the remaining value is associated with Mackenzie Delta, Alaska North Slope and Australia natural gas projects, on which we continue to work with partners and regulatory agencies in order to develop. See the following discussion of Exploratory Costs for more information on suspended exploratory wells. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. In these situations, recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find as a producing well, without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made. Once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed, the economic viability of the overall project, including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made, is evaluated. If economically viable, internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. In addition to reviewing suspended well balances quarterly, management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. 90 At year-end 2005, total suspended well costs were $339 million, compared with $347 million at year-end 2004. For additional information on suspended wells, see Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s exploration and production (E&P) operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year-end 2005 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2004 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our 16.1 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas proved reserves at year-end 2005 were estimated based on LUKOIL’s prior year’s report (adjusted for known additions, license extensions, dispositions, and public information) and included adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provided for estimated 2005 production. Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves. The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2005, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $31.9 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2005 was approximately $2.5 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 4.8 billion BOE at the beginning of 2005 and were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2005. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 258 million barrels at the beginning of 2005 and were 251 million barrels at the end of 2005. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2005 would have been increased by an estimated $131 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $4 million, $67million and $225 million, respectively. Of these write-downs, only $1 million in 2005, $52 million in 2004 and $19 million in 2003 were due to downward revisions of 91 proved reserves. The remainder of the impairments in 2003 resulted either from properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal in 2003 of the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) that increased asset removal obligations. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles, Note 11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 15—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of 92 individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and trade names, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also, in connection with the acquisition of Tosco, the merger of Conoco and Phillips, and the acquisition of an ownership interest in a producing oil business in Libya, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Within our E&P segment and our R&M segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies’ operations did not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas. In our E&P segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the 93 operating segment. In contrast, in our R&M segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of R&M have dissimilar business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the R&M segment level. Instead, we identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year-end 2005, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 17 percent to 67 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the $15.3 billion of goodwill. During 2006, we expect to acquire Burlington Resources Inc., subject to approval of the transaction by Burlington’s shareholders and appropriate regulatory agencies. We expect this acquisition to result in the accounting recognition of a material amount of additional goodwill, all of which will be associated with our Worldwide Exploration and Production reporting unit. Based on our goodwill impairment testing at year-end 2005, we anticipate that this reporting unit will have adequate capacity to absorb this additional goodwill from the Burlington transaction and will not result in an impairment. Use of Equity Method Accounting for Investment in LUKOIL In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of LUKOIL from the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004 and throughout 2005, we purchased additional shares of LUKOIL on the open market and reached an ownership level of 16.1 percent in LUKOIL by the end of 2005. On January 24, 2005, LUKOIL held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the LUKOIL Board of Directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in Russia, and certain amendments to LUKOIL’s charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of major stockholders in LUKOIL, such as ConocoPhillips. In addition, during the first quarter of 2005, the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two companies. 94 Based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in LUKOIL, we concluded that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL and thus applied the equity method of accounting beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. Determination of whether one company has significant influence over another, the criterion required by APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” in order to use equity method accounting, is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of each situation. Under the equity method of accounting, we estimate and record our weighted-average ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)) each period as equity earnings on our income statement, with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in LUKOIL. Cash dividends received from LUKOIL will reduce our recorded investment in LUKOIL. The use of equity-method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures in our report. If future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant influence over LUKOIL’s operating and financial policies, we would have to change our accounting classification for the investment to an available-for-sale equity security under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” If that unlikely event were to occur, our investment in LUKOIL would be marked to market each period, based on LUKOIL’s publicly traded share price, with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Additionally, we would no longer record our ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income each period and any cash dividends would be reported as dividend income when declared by LUKOIL. We also would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. During 2005, we recorded $756 million of equity-method earnings from our 13.1 percent weighted-average ownership level in LUKOIL. Our reported earnings for the LUKOIL Investment segment of $714 million included the above equity-method earnings, less certain expenses and taxes. At December 31, 2005, we supplementally reported an estimated 1,242 million barrels of crude oil and 1,197 billion cubic feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of 16.1 percent at year-end 2005. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, we have used all available information to estimate LUKOIL’s U.S. GAAP net income for the year 2005 for purposes of our equity-method accounting. Any differences between our estimate of fourth-quarter 2005 net income and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will be recorded in our 2006 equity earnings. In addition, we used all available information to estimate our share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. If, instead of equity-method accounting, we had been required to follow the requirements of SFAS No. 115 for our investment in LUKOIL, the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect LUKOIL’s publicly-traded share price at year-end 2005 would have been a pretax benefit to other comprehensive income of approximately $3,298 million. Also, $19 million of acquisition-related costs would have been expensed and $756 million of current year equity-method earnings would not have been recorded. At the end of 2005, the cost of our investment in LUKOIL exceeded our 16.1 percent share of LUKOIL’s historical U.S. GAAP balance sheet equity by an estimated $1,375 million. Under the accounting guidelines of APB Opinion No. 18, we account for the basis difference between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of LUKOIL as if LUKOIL were a consolidated subsidiary. In other words, a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine how LUKOIL assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical push-down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in LUKOIL’s shares. Once these hypothetical push-down adjustments have been identified, the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference. The majority of the basis difference is associated with LUKOIL’s developed property, plant and equipment base. The earnings we recorded for 95 our LUKOIL investment thus included a reduction for the amortization of this basis difference. In 2005, we completed the purchase price allocation related to our 2004 share purchases of LUKOIL. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $105 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moody’s Aa corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. OUTLOOK On the evening of December 12, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc. announced that they had signed a definitive agreement under which ConocoPhillips would acquire Burlington Resources Inc. The transaction has a preliminary value of $33.9 billion. This transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2006, subject to approval by Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting set for March 30, 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, Burlington Resources shareholders will receive $46.50 in cash and 0.7214 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources share they own. This represents a transaction value of $92 per share, based on the closing of ConocoPhillips shares on Friday, December 9, 2005, the last unaffected day of trading prior to the announcement. We anticipate that the cash portion of the purchase price, approximately $17.5 billion, will be financed with a combination of short- and long-term debt and available cash. Burlington Resources is an independent exploration and production company that holds a substantial position in North American natural gas reserves and production. Upon completion of the transaction, Bobby S. Shakouls, Burlington Resources’ President and Chief Executive Officer, and William E. Wade Jr., currently an independent director of Burlington Resources, will join our Board of Directors. For additional information about the acquisition, see Note 28—Pending Acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 96 In October 2005, we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle with the state of Alaska on the base fiscal contract terms for an Alaskan natural gas pipeline project. In early 2006, the state of Alaska announced that they had reached an agreement in principle with all the co-venturers in the project. Once the final form of agreement is reached among all the parties, it will be subject to approval by the Alaska State Legislature before it can be executed. Additional agreements for the gas to transit Canada will also be required. In February 2006, the governor of Alaska announced proposed legislation to change the state's oil and gas production tax structure. The proposed structure would be based on a percentage of revenues less certain expenditures, and include certain incentives to encourage new investment. If approved by the legislature, the new tax structure would go into effect July 1, 2006. If enacted, we would anticipate an increase in our production taxes in Alaska, based on an initial assessment of the proposed legislation. In addition to our participation in the LNG regasification terminal at Freeport, Texas, we are pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals in the United States. The Beacon Port Terminal would be located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these proposed projects is in various stages of the regulatory permitting process. In the United Kingdom, with effect from January 1, 2006, legislation is pending to increase the rate of supplementary corporation tax applicable to U.K. upstream activity from 10 percent to 20 percent. This would result in the overall U.K. upstream corporation tax rate increasing from 40 percent to 50 percent. The earnings impact of these changes will be reflected in our financial statements when the legislation is substantially enacted, which could occur in the third quarter of 2006. Upon enactment, we expect to record a charge for the revaluing of the December 31, 2005, deferred tax liability, as well as an adjustment to our tax expense to reflect the new rate from January 1, 2006, through the date of enactment. We are currently evaluating the full financial impact of this proposed legislation on our financial statements. In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 11 percent in March 2005 did not have a significant impact on our operations there; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact. Based on public comments by Venezuelan government officials, Venezuelan legislation could be enacted that would increase the income tax rate on foreign companies operating in the Orinoco Oil Belt from 34 percent to 50 percent. We continue to work closely with the Venezuelan government on any potential impacts to our heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. In November 2005, the Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP) proponents elected to proceed to the regulatory hearings, which began in January 2006. This followed an earlier halting of selected data collection, engineering and preliminary contracting work due to insufficient progress on key areas critical to the project. Since that time, considerable progress has been made with respect to Canadian government socio-economic funding, regulatory process and schedule, the negotiation of benefits and access agreements with four of the five aboriginal groups in the field areas and on the pipeline route. First production from the Parsons Lake field is now expected in 2011. 97 In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. Preliminary engineering and design studies have been completed. In April 2005, the Qatar Minister of Petroleum stated that there would be a postponement of new GTL projects in order to further study impacts on infrastructure, shipping and contractors, and to ensure that the development of its gas resources occurs at a sustainable rate. Work continues with Qatar authorities on the appropriate timing of the project to meet the objectives of Qatar and ConocoPhillips. In R&M, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during 2006. We expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2006 to average in the mid-nineties. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL and the pending acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Also in R&M, we are planning to spend $4 billion to $5 billion over the period 2006 through 2011 to increase our U.S. refining system’s ability to process heavy-sour crude oil and other lower-quality feedstocks. These investments are expected to incrementally increase refining capacity and clean products yield at our existing facilities, while providing competitive returns. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business.• Changes in our business, operations, results and prospects.• The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures.• Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance.• Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities.• Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance.• Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining.• Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing or refining our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. 98 • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products.• Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance.• Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG projects and related facilities.• Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism.• International monetary conditions and exchange controls.• Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.• Liability resulting from litigation.• General domestic and international economic and political conditions, including armed hostilities and governmental disputes over territorial boundaries.• Changes in tax and other laws, regulations or royalty rules applicable to our business.• Inability to obtain economical financing for exploration and development projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 99 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.• Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.• Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions.• Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations. 100 We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2005, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Floating Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Year-End 2005 2006 $ 1,534 5.73 % $ 180 5.32 % 2007 170 7.24 — — 2008 27 6.99 — — 2009 304 6.43 — — 2010 1,280 8.73 41 4.51 Remaining years 7,830 6.45 721 3.71 Total $ 11,145 $ 942 Fair value $ 12,484 $ 942 Year-End 2004 2005 $ 19 7.70 % $ 552 2.34 % 2006 1,508 5.82 110 5.85 2007 613 4.89 — — 2008 23 6.90 — — 2009 1,065 6.37 3 2.84 Remaining years 9,788 7.05 751 2.24 Total $ 13,016 $ 1,416 Fair value $ 14,710 $ 1,416 101 During the fourth quarter of 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate, but during 2005 we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps as we redeemed the associated debt. This reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to floating by the end of 2005 to $350 million. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge. Interest Rate Derivatives Expected Maturity Date Notional Average Pay Rate Average Receive Rate Year-End 2005 2006—variable to fixed $ 116 5.85 % 4.10 % 2007 — — — 2008 — — — 2009 — — — 2010 — — — Remaining years—fixed to variable 350 4.35 4.75 Total $ 466 Fair value position $ (8 ) Year-End 2004 2005 $ — — % — % 2006—variable to fixed 126 5.85 2.04 2007—fixed to variable 400 3.01 3.63 2008 — — — 2009—fixed to variable 750 5.22 6.35 Remaining years—fixed to variable 350 2.27 4.75 Total $ 1,626 Fair value position $ 2 Foreign Currency Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2005 or 2004, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows: 102 Millions of Dollars Foreign Currency Swaps Notional Fair Market Value 2005 2004 2005 2004 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro $ 492 370 (8 ) 13 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound 463 1,253 (12 ) 14 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar 517 85 — 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruny — 13 — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone 3 15 — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner 1,210 991 (15 ) 58 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Polish zlotych — 2 — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona 107 148 1 3 Buy U.S. dollar, sell Polish zlotych 3 — — — Buy euro, sell Norwegian kroner 2 — — — Buy euro, sell Swedish krona 13 — — — For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 16—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 103 Item 8.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings. Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2005, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. /s/ J. J. Mulva /s/ John A. Carrig J. J.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 38,400 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2006 had assets of $165 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” On March 31, 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., an independent exploration and production company that held a substantial position in North American natural gas proved reserves, production and exploratory acreage. This acquisition added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves. The acquisition is reflected in our results of operations beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Our business is organized into six operating segments: · Exploration and Production (E&P) —This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. · Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, formerly named Duke Energy Field Services, LLC. · Refining and Marketing (R&M) —This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. · LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2006, our ownership interest, based on authorized and issued shares, was 20 percent, and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. · Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). 49 · Emerging Businesses—This segment includes the development of new technologies and businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: · Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: · Successful exploration and development of new fields. · Acquisition of existing fields. · Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In late 2005, we signed an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation under which we and our co-venturers acquired an ownership interest in the Waha concessions in Libya. As a result, we added 238 million barrels to our net proved crude oil reserves in 2005. The acquisition of Burlington Resources in March of 2006 added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves, and through our investments in LUKOIL over the past three years we purchased about 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the three years ending December 31, 2006, our reserve replacement was 254 percent, including the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition and our additional equity investment in LUKOIL. · Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2006, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was 92 percent, compared with 93 percent in 2005. The reduced utilization rate reflects both scheduled downtime and unplanned weather-related downtime. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. · Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs and prudently managing our capital program, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years, and the subsequent increase in industry-wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies are experiencing inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs include rates for drilling rigs, steel and other raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. While we work to manage the effect these inflationary pressures have on our costs, our capital program has been impacted by these factors, and certain projects have been delayed. Our capital program may be further impacted by these factors going forward. 50 · Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2006 totaled $15.6 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $12.3 billion in 2007. · Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2005 and 2006, we increased our investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 20 percent ownership interest, based on authorized and issued shares. During 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources. Also during 2006, we announced the commencement of an asset rationalization program to evaluate our asset base to identify those assets that may no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. This program generated proceeds of $1.5 billion through January 31, 2007. We expect this rationalization program to result in proceeds from asset dispositions of $3 billion to $4 billion. In December 2006, we announced a program to dispose of our company-owned U.S. retail marketing outlets to new or existing wholesale marketers. · Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: · Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins, decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. Property impairments in 2006 totaled $383 million, compared with $42 million in 2005. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. · Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year-end 2006 we had $31.5 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, after reclassifying $340 million to current assets and recording an impairment of $230 million related to assets held for sale. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative, though non-cash, effect on our profitability. · Effective Tax Rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pre-tax earnings within our global operations. 51 · Fiscal and Regulatory Environment. As commodity prices and refining margins improved over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, averaging $66.00 per barrel in 2006, an increase of 17 percent. The increase was primarily due to growth in global consumption associated with continuing economic expansions and limited spare capacity from major exporting countries. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub decreased during 2006 to $7.24 per million British thermal units (MMBTU), down 16 percent, compared with the 2005 average of $8.64 per MMBTU, primarily due to high storage levels and moderate weather. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. During 2005, we increased our ownership interest in DCP Midstream from 30.3 percent to 50 percent, and we recorded a gain of $306 million, after-tax, for our equity share of DCP Midstream’s sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO). An adjustment recorded in 2006 increased this gain by $24 million. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 11 percent in 2006, generally tracking the increase in crude oil prices. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were stronger overall in comparison to 2005, contributing to improved R&M profitability. Key factors contributing to the stronger refining margins in 2006 were high U.S. gasoline and distillate demand. Industry marketing margins in the United States were stronger in 2006, compared with those in 2005, as the market did not encounter the steep product cost increases experienced in 2005 due to hurricanes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares from the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of 2004, all of 2005 and 2006, we invested an additional $5.5 billion, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent by year-end 2006, based on authorized and issued shares. We initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to Russia’s resource potential, where LUKOIL has significant positions in proved reserves and production. We also are benefiting from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our E&P segment should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in the northern Timan-Pechora province of Russia, and an opportunity to potentially participate in the development of the West Qurna field in Iraq. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. Our 2006 financial results from Chemicals were the strongest since the formation of CPChem in 2000, as this business line has emerged from a deep cyclical downturn that began around that time. 52 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. The businesses in this segment focus on staying current on new technologies to support our primary segments. They also pursue technologies involving heavy oils, biofuels, and alternative energy sources. Some of these technologies may have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 9,848 8,430 5,702 Midstream 476 688 235 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 4,481 4,173 2,743 LUKOIL Investment 1,425 714 74 Chemicals 492 323 249 Emerging Businesses 15 (21 ) (102 ) Corporate and Other (1,187 ) (778 ) (772 ) Net income $ 15,550 13,529 8,129 2006 vs. 2005 The improved results in 2006 were primarily the result of: · Higher crude oil prices in the E&P segment. · The inclusion of Burlington Resources in our results of operations for the E&P segment. · Improved refining margins and volumes and marketing margins in the R&M segment’s U.S. operations. · Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to an increase in our ownership percentage and higher estimated commodity prices and volumes. · The recognition in 2006 of business interruption insurance recoveries attributable to hurricanes in 2005. These items were partially offset by: · The impairment of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments. · Lower natural gas prices in the E&P segment. · Higher interest and debt expense resulting from higher average debt levels due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. · Decreased net income from the Midstream segment, reflecting the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. 53 2005 vs. 2004 The improved results in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily were due to: · Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream segments. · Improved refining margins in our R&M segment. · Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. · Our equity share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of its general partner interest in TEPPCO in 2005. Income Statement Analysis 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and other operating revenues increased 2 percent in 2006, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 5 percent. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was primarily due to higher realized prices for crude oil and petroleum products, as well as higher sales volumes associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were mostly offset by decreases associated with the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.” The decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products was primarily the result of the implementation of Issue No. 04-13. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the impact of this Issue on our income statement. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2006. The increase reflects improved results from: · LUKOIL, resulting from an increase in our ownership percentage, as well as higher estimated crude oil and petroleum products prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOIL’s fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOIL’s reported results. · Our chemicals joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins and volumes, as well as the recognition of a business interruption insurance net benefit. These increases were offset partially by the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Other income increased 47 percent during 2006, primarily due to the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. In addition, interest income was higher in 2006. These increases were partially offset by higher net gains on asset dispositions recorded in 2005. Production and operating expenses increased 22 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the acquired Burlington Resources assets, increased production at the Bayu-Undan field associated with the Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, the first year of production in Libya, and the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Exploration expenses increased 26 percent in 2006, primarily due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 71 percent during 2006. The increase was primarily the result of the addition of Burlington Resources assets in E&P’s depreciable asset base. In addition, the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery increased DD&A recorded by the R&M segment. 54 Impairments were $683 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005. The increase primarily relates to the impairment in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. We also recorded an impairment charge in the E&P segment associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area, as a result of declining well performance and drilling results. See Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Interest and debt expense increased from $497 million in 2005 to $1,087 million in 2006, primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. 2005 vs. 2004 Sales and other operating revenues increased 33 percent in 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 39 percent. These increases primarily were due to higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 125 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase reflects a full year’s equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: · Our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil prices benefiting both ventures, and higher production volumes at Hamaca. · Our chemicals joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins. · Our midstream joint venture, DCP Midstream, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices and DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of its TEPPCO general partner interest. · Our joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. · Our joint-venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials. Other income increased 52 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was mainly due to higher net gains on asset dispositions in 2005, as well as higher interest income. Asset dispositions in 2005 included the sale of our interest in coalbed methane acreage positions in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, as well as our interests in Dixie Pipeline, Turcas Petrol A.S., and Venture Coke Company. Asset dispositions in 2004 included our interest in the Petrovera heavy-oil joint venture in Canada. Production and operating expenses increased 16 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The E&P segment had higher maintenance and transportation costs; higher costs associated with new fields, including the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico; negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates; and upward insurance premium adjustments. The R&M segment had higher utility costs due to higher natural gas prices, as well as higher maintenance and repair costs due to increased turnaround activity and hurricane impacts. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 12 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to new projects in the E&P segment, including a full year’s production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp-up at the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea. 55 We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (FIN 47), effective December 31, 2005. As a result, we recognized a charge of $88 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Restructuring Program As a result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, we implemented a restructuring program in March 2006 to capture the synergies of combining the two companies. Under this program, which is expected to be completed by the end of March 2008, we recorded accruals totaling $230 million for employee severance payments, site closings, incremental pension benefit costs associated with the workforce reductions, and employee relocations. Approximately 600 positions have been identified for elimination, most of which are in the United States. Of the total accrual, $224 million is reflected in the Burlington Resources purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $6 million ($4 million after-tax) related to ConocoPhillips is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in the total accruals of $230 million is $12 million related to pension benefits to be paid in conjunction with other retirement benefits over a number of future years. See Note 6—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 56 Segment Results E&P 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 2,347 2,552 1,832 Lower 48 2,001 1,736 1,110 United States 4,348 4,288 2,942 International 5,500 4,142 2,760 $ 9,848 8,430 5,702 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 61.09 51.09 38.25 International 63.38 52.27 37.18 Total consolidated 62.39 51.74 37.65 Equity affiliates* 46.01 37.79 24.18 Worldwide E&P 60.37 49.87 36.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 6.11 7.12 5.33 International 6.27 5.78 4.14 Total consolidated 6.20 6.32 4.62 Equity affiliates* .30 .26 2.19 Worldwide E&P 6.19 6.30 4.61 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 40.35 40.40 31.05 International 42.89 36.25 28.96 Total consolidated 41.50 38.32 30.02 Equity affiliates* — — — Worldwide E&P 41.50 38.32 30.02 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 5.43 4.24 3.70 International** 5.65 4.58 3.86 Total consolidated** 5.55 4.43 3.79 Equity affiliates* 5.83 4.93 4.14 Worldwide E&P** 5.57 4.47 3.81 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. **Prior years restated to reflect reclassification of certain costs to conform to current year presentation.

It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2006, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, Algeria, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the E&P segment increased 17 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher sales prices for natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes, primarily the result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, contributed positively to net income in 2006. These items were partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, the negative impacts of changes in tax laws, and asset impairments. If crude oil prices in 2007 do not remain at the levels experienced in 2006, and if costs continue to increase, the E&P segment’s earnings would be negatively impacted. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices and inflationary cost pressures. Proved reserves at year-end 2006 were 9.36 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.92 billion BOE at year-end 2005. This excludes the estimated 1,805 million BOE and 1,442 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude mining operations, which was 243 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at year-end 2006, compared with 251 million barrels at year-end 2005. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased slightly in 2006, primarily resulting from higher crude oil prices, as well as increased crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production in the Lower 48 states, reflecting the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, lower production levels in Alaska, and higher production taxes in Alaska. In August 2006, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, retroactive to April 1, 2006. The new legislation results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 808,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 633,000 barrels per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of volumes from the Burlington Resources assets, offset slightly by decreases in production levels in Alaska. Production in Alaska was negatively impacted by operational shut downs and weather-related transportation delays. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased 33 percent in 2006, reflecting higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices and production, as well as higher levels of LNG production from the Darwin LNG facility associated with the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea. These increases were offset partially by increased exploration expenses and a $93 million after-tax impairment charge associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. In addition, the increases to net income were partially offset by the negative impacts of tax law changes. 59 The following international tax legislation was enacted during 2006: · In the United Kingdom, the rate of supplementary corporation tax applicable to U.K. upstream activity increased in July 2006 from 10 percent to 20 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2006, which increased the U.K. upstream corporation tax from 40 percent to 50 percent. This resulted in additional tax expense during 2006 of approximately $470 million, comprised of approximately $250 million for revaluing beginning deferred tax liability balances, and approximately $220 million to reflect the new rate from January 1, 2006. · In Canada, the Alberta government reduced the Alberta corporate income tax rate from 11.5 percent to 10 percent, effective April 2006. In addition, the Canadian federal government announced federal tax rate reductions whereby the federal tax rate will decline by 2 percent over the period 2008 to 2010 and the 1.12 percent federal surtax will be eliminated in 2008. As a result of these tax rate reductions, we recorded a one-time favorable adjustment in the E&P segment of $401 million to our deferred tax liability in the second quarter of 2006. · The China Ministry of Finance enacted a “Special Levy on Earnings from Petroleum Enterprises,” effective March 26, 2006. The special levy, which is based on the cost recovery price of crude oil, starts at a rate of 20 percent of the excess price when crude oil prices exceed $40 per barrel, and increases 5 percent for every corresponding $5 per barrel increase in the cost recovery price. Once the cost recovery price reaches $60 per barrel, a maximum levy rate of 40 percent is applied. This special levy resulted in a negative impact to earnings of $41 million in 2006. · The Venezuelan government enacted an extraction tax of 33.33 percent with an effective date of May 29, 2006. The tax is calculated based on the value of oil extracted, less royalty payments. This extraction tax resulted in a reduction in our equity earnings of $113 million in 2006. An increase in the Venezuelan income tax rate from 34 percent to 50 percent for heavy-oil projects was enacted in the third quarter of 2006, and became effective with the tax year beginning January 1, 2007. Had this new rate been in effect in 2006, our equity earnings would have been reduced by an estimated $205 million. · The Algerian government enacted an exceptional profits tax with an effective date of August 1, 2006. In general, the exceptional profits tax applies to all calendar months during which the monthly arithmetic average of the high and low Brent price is greater than $30 per barrel. The tax rate is determined by reference to a price coefficient, the calculation of which is prescribed in the legislation. For 2006, the rate of the tax was 6.2 percent. The resulting negative impact on earnings in 2006 was approximately $36 million, including a rate adjustment effected in respect of the deferred tax provision. International E&P production averaged 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006, an increase of 24 percent from 910,000 BOE per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of Burlington Resources assets, higher gas production at Bayu-Undan associated with the Darwin LNG ramp-up in Australia, and the 2006 reentry into Libya. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the E&P segment increased 48 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes associated with the Magnolia and Bayu-Undan fields, as well as the Hamaca project, contributed positively to net income in 2005. Partially offsetting these items were increased production and operating costs, DD&A and taxes, as well as mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. 60 U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 46 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher sales volumes from the Magnolia deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in late 2004; and higher gains from asset sales in 2005. These items were partially offset by: · Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased transportation costs and well workover and other maintenance activity, and the impact of newly producing fields and environmental accruals. · Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Magnolia field and other new fields. · Higher production taxes, resulting from increased prices for crude oil and natural gas. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 633,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 629,000 barrels per day in 2004. The slight increase reflects the positive impact of a full year’s production from the Magnolia field and the purchase of overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin, mostly offset by normal field production declines, hurricane-related downtime, and the impact of asset dispositions. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased 50 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. In addition, we had higher sales volumes from the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea and the Hamaca project in Venezuela. These items were partially offset by: · Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased costs at our Canadian Syncrude operations (including higher utility costs there) and increased costs associated with newly producing fields. · Mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. · Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Bayu-Undan field. · Higher income taxes incurred by our equity affiliates at our Venezuelan heavy-oil projects. International E&P production averaged 910,000 BOE per day in 2005, a slight decrease from 913,000 BOE per day in 2004. Production was favorably impacted in 2005 by the Bayu-Undan field and the Hamaca heavy-oil upgrader project. At the Bayu-Undan field, 2005 production was higher than in 2004, when production was still ramping up. At the Hamaca project, production increased in late 2004 with the startup of a heavy-oil upgrader. These increases in production were offset by the impact of planned and unplanned maintenance, and field production declines. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2004. 61 Midstream 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 476 688 235 *Includes DCP Midstream-related net income: $ 385 591 143 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 40.22 36.68 29.38 Equity 39.45 35.52 28.60 *Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, formerly named Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. In July 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective ownership levels in DCP Midstream, which resulted in DCP Midstream becoming a jointly controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. Prior to the restructuring, our ownership interest in DCP Midstream was 30.3 percent. This restructuring increased our ownership in DCP Midstream through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain Canadian Midstream assets from DCP Midstream to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution from DCP Midstream to Duke from the sale of DCP Midstream’s interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (TEPPCO), and a combined payment by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DCP Midstream of approximately $840 million. The Empress plant in Canada was not included in the initial transaction as originally anticipated due to weather-related damage. Subsequently, we sold the Empress plant to Duke in August 2005 for approximately $230 million. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 31 percent in 2006, primarily due to the gain from the sale of DCP Midstream’s interest in TEPPCO included in 2005 results. Our net share of this gain was $306 million on an after-tax basis. This decrease was partially offset by a $24 million positive tax adjustment recorded in 2006 to the gain recorded in 2005 on the sale of DCP Midstream’s interest in TEPPCO, as well as higher natural gas liquids prices and an increased ownership interest in DCP Midstream. 62 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 193 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. Included in the Midstream segment’s 2005 net income is a $306 million gain, representing our share of DCP Midstream’s gain on the sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO. In addition, our Midstream segment benefited from improved natural gas liquids prices in 2005, which increased earnings at DCP Midstream, as well as our other Midstream operations. These positive items were partially offset by the loss of earnings from asset dispositions completed in 2004 and 2005. Included in the Midstream segment’s net income was a benefit of $17 million in 2005, compared with $36 million in 2004, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our equity interest in the net assets of DCP Midstream over the book value of our investment in DCP Midstream. The reduced amount in 2005 resulted from a significant reduction in the favorable basis difference of our investment in DCP Midstream following the restructuring. 63 R&M 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 3,915 3,329 2,126 International 566 844 617 $ 4,481 4,173 2,743 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 2.04 1.73 1.33 Retail 2.18 1.88 1.52 Distillates—wholesale 2.11 1.80 1.24 *Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 2,208,000, 2,182,000 and 2,160,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States. Actual international capacity was 693,000 barrels per day at year-end 2006 and 428,000 barrels per day at year-end 2005 and 2004. 64 The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the R&M segment increased 7 percent in 2006. The increase resulted primarily from: · Higher U.S. refining and marketing margins, and higher U.S. refining volumes. · The recognition of a net benefit related to business interruption insurance. · The inclusion of an $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in the results for 2005. The increase in net income was partially offset by impairments on assets held for sale recognized in 2006, as well as higher depreciation expense. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for our view of the factors supporting industry refining and marketing margins. We expect our average worldwide refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2007 to average in the mid-nineties. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2006, primarily due to: · Higher refining and marketing margins, and higher refining volumes. · The recognition of a net $111 million business interruption insurance benefit. · A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in 2005. These items were partially offset by after-tax impairments of $227 million associated with certain assets held for sale, as well as higher depreciation expense. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2006, the same as in 2005, reflecting unplanned weather-related downtime in both years. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations decreased 33 percent in 2006, due primarily to: · The recognition of a $214 million after-tax impairment charge on certain assets held for sale. · Lower refining margins. · Preliminary engineering costs for certain refinery-related projects. These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange impacts and higher refining and marketing sales volumes. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2006, compared with 99 percent in 2005. The decrease reflects scheduled downtime at certain refineries and unscheduled downtime at the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 65 In February 2006, we acquired the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. The purchase included the refinery, a marine terminal, rail and truck loading facilities and a tank farm, as well as another entity that provides commercial and administrative support to the refinery. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the R&M segment increased 52 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher worldwide refining margins. Higher refining margins were partially offset by: · Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. · Increased turnaround costs. · Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. · An $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 57 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase mainly was the result of higher U.S. refining margins, partially offset by: · Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. · Increased turnaround costs. · Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. · A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2005, compared with 95 percent in 2004. The lower 2005 rate was impacted by downtime related to hurricanes. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations increased 37 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins, along with improved refinery production volumes and increased results from marketing. These factors were partially offset by negative foreign currency exchange impacts and higher utility costs. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 99 percent in 2005, compared with 91 percent in 2004. A larger volume of turnaround activity in 2004 contributed to most of this variance. 66 LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 1,425 714 74 Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 360 235 38 Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 244 67 13 Net refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 179 122 19 *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. During 2005, we expended $2,160 million to purchase LUKOIL’s ordinary shares, increasing our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. We expended another $2,715 million to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent at December 31, 2006, based on 851 million shares authorized and issued. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity-method accounting, was 20.6 percent at December 31, 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 100 percent during 2006, primarily as a result of our increased equity ownership, higher estimated prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOIL’s fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOIL’s reported results. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated, based on current market indicators, historical production and cost trends of LUKOIL, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005, recorded in 2006, increased net income $71 million, compared with a $10 million increase to net income recorded in 2005 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition to our estimate of our equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2005 vs. 2004 In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s ordinary shares from the Russian government, and during the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10 percent. During 2005, we further increased our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. The 2005 results for the LUKOIL Investment segment reflect this increase in ownership, as well as favorable market conditions, including strong crude oil prices. 67 Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 492 323 249 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 52 percent during 2006. Results for 2006 reflected improved olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes. The results for 2006 also included a hurricane-related business interruption insurance benefit of $20 million after-tax, as well as lower utility costs due to decreased natural gas prices. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 30 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was attributable to higher ethylene and polyethylene margins. Partially offsetting these margin improvements were higher utility costs, reflecting increased costs of natural gas, as well as hurricane-related impacts on 2005 production, and maintenance and repair costs. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 82 43 (31 ) Technology solutions (23 ) (16 ) (18 ) Other (44 ) (48 ) (53 ) $ 15 (21 ) (102 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation; carbon-to-liquids; technology solutions, such as sulfur removal technologies; and alternative energy programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum-based products, and renewable fuels. 2006 vs. 2005 The Emerging Businesses segment had net income of $15 million in 2006, compared with a net loss of $21 million in 2005. The improved results reflect higher international power margins and volumes. The increase in net income was partially offset by a write-down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant, as well as lower domestic power margins and volumes. 68 2005 vs. 2004 The Emerging Businesses segment incurred a net loss of $21 million in 2005, compared with a net loss of $102 million in 2004. The improved results in 2005 reflect: · The first full year of operations at the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, which began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2004. · Lower costs in the gas-to-liquids business due to the closing of a demonstration plant. · Improved margins in the domestic power generation business. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 * 2004 Net Income (Loss) Net interest $ (870 ) (467 ) (514 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (133 ) (183 ) (212 ) Discontinued operations — (23 ) 22 Acquisition/merger-related costs (98 ) — (14 ) Other (86 ) (105 ) (54 ) $ (1,187 ) (778 ) (772 ) *Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 2006 vs. 2005 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 86 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. The increases were partially offset by higher amounts of interest being capitalized, as well as higher premiums incurred in 2005 on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 27 percent in 2006, primarily due to reduced benefit-related expenses. Acquisition/merger-related costs in 2006 included seismic relicensing and other transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. In 2007, we anticipate transition costs to be approximately $45 million after-tax. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other improved during 2006, primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2006, versus losses in 2005, partially offset by certain tax items not directly attributable to the operating segments. 2005 vs. 2004 Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income. Interest income increased as a result of our higher average cash balances during 2005. These items were partially offset by increased early debt retirement fees and a lower amount 69 of interest being capitalized in 2005, reflecting the completion of several major projects in the second half of 2004. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 14 percent in 2005. The decrease reflects increased allocations of management-level stock-based compensation to the operating segments, which had previously been retained at corporate. These increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments’ results. This was partially offset by increased charitable contributions. Discontinued operations had a loss in 2005 compared with income in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2004 and 2005. Results from Other were lower in 2005, mainly due to certain unfavorable foreign currency transaction impacts. 70 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 21,516 17,628 11,959 Notes payable and long-term debt due within one year 4,043 1,758 632 Total debt 27,134 12,516 15,002 Minority interests 1,202 1,209 1,105 Common stockholders’ equity 82,646 52,731 42,723 Percent of total debt to capital* 24 % 19 26 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 41 9 19 *Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders’ equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2006 we raised $545 million in funds from the sale of assets. During 2006, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, provide loan financing to certain equity affiliates, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund a portion of our acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2006 were $2.3 billion. During 2006, cash and cash equivalents declined $1,397 million to $817 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our cash balance, commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements, to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We anticipate these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2008, including our capital spending program, our share repurchase programs, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana), which closed January 3, 2007. For additional information about the EnCana transaction, see Note 31—Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2004 through 2006. Favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. In addition, cash flows in 2006 benefited from the inclusion of the operating activity of Burlington Resources beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Absent any unusual event during 2007, we expect market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2007 operating cash flows. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2006, cash of $21,516 million was provided by operating activities, a 22 percent increase over cash from operations of $17,628 million in 2005. This increase reflects higher worldwide crude oil prices and U.S. refining margins, higher distributions from equity affiliates, and the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. 71 During 2005, cash flow from operations increased $5,669 million to $17,628 million. The improvement, compared with 2004, primarily resulted from higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as improved worldwide refining margins. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2005 and 2006, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors that affect production, they cause certain variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that experienced with commodity prices and refining margins. After adjusting our 2003 production for assets sold in 2003 and early 2004, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three years, driven primarily by acquisitions, including our increased ownership interest in LUKOIL over 2005 and 2006, and the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006. Going forward, based on our 2006 production level of 2.34 million BOE per day, we expect our annual production growth to average in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent over the five-year period ending in 2011. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp-up in those years, include our equity share of LUKOIL, and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement over the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, was 254 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant reason for our successful replacement of reserves over the past three years. These purchases included the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006 and the reentry into Libya in late 2005, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base going forward. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2006 and 2004, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2005, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the “Capital Spending” section for analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and typically any 72 variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that experienced with refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 were $545 million, compared with $768 million in 2005. We announced in April 2006 an asset rationalization program to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. We expect the program to result in proceeds from asset dispositions of $3 billion to $4 billion. Through January 31, 2007, proceeds from asset sales under this program were approximately $1.5 billion. In December 2006, we announced a program to dispose of our U.S. company-owned retail marketing outlets to new or existing wholesale marketers. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2006, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion that expire in October 2011. Also, we have a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in April 2011, for which we recently requested an extension of one year in accordance with the terms of the facility. These facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, or as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ourselves, or by any of our consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. The ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, but $41 million and $62 million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. Under both commercial paper programs, there was $2,931 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, compared with $32 million at December 31, 2005. The commercial paper increase resulted from efforts to reduce the bridge facilities used for the acquisition of Burlington Resources discussed below. Since we had $2,931 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $41 million of letters of credit, we had access to $4.5 billion in borrowing capacity under the three revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, Moody’s Investor Service had a rating of A1 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of A-. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. Financing the Burlington Resources Inc. Acquisition On March 31, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. by issuing approximately 270.4 million of our common shares, 32.1 million of which were issued from treasury shares, and paying approximately $17.5 billion in cash. We acquired $3.2 billion in cash and assumed $4.3 billion of debt from Burlington Resources in the acquisition. The cash payment was made through borrowings from two $7.5 billion bridge facilities, combined with $2.2 billion from cash balances and the issuance of 73 $300 million in commercial paper. The bridge facilities were both 364-day loan facilities with pricing and terms similar to our existing revolving credit facilities. In April 2006, we entered into and funded a $5 billion five-year term loan, closed on the previously mentioned $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility, increased the ConocoPhillips commercial paper program to $7.5 billion, and issued $3 billion of debt securities. The term loan and new credit facility were broadly syndicated among financial institutions, with terms and pricing provisions similar to our two other existing revolving credit facilities. The proceeds from the term loan, debt securities and issuances of commercial paper, together with our cash balances and cash provided by operations, allowed us to repay the $15 billion bridge facilities during the second and third quarters of 2006. The $3 billion of debt securities were issued under a new shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early April 2006 allowing for the issuance of various types of debt and equity securities. Of this issuance, $1 billion of Floating Rate Notes due April 11, 2007, were issued by ConocoPhillips, and $1.25 billion of Floating Rate Notes due April 9, 2009, and $750 million of 5.50% Notes due 2013 were issued by ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company guarantee the obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company. In October 2006, we filed a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to terminate the offering of securities under the registration statement. Shelf Registrations In mid-April 2006, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. In October 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. See the “Capital Requirements” section below for additional information on the issuance of debt securities under this registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding $1,202 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $508 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, $672 million, was related to the Darwin LNG project located in northern Australia. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2006, was 6.69 percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2006, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2006, Ashford held $1.9 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $29 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest 74 because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2006, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: · Qatargas 3: Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, which is expected to be December 31, 2009, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non-recourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2006, Qatargas 3 had $1.2 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $371 million, including accrued interest. · Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2.0 billion in credit facilities of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), which will be used to construct a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facility is fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved mid-2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt non-recourse. For additional information, see Note 7—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. · Other: At December 31, 2006, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 18 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was approximately $140 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 17—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about the financing of the Burlington Resources acquisition or our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Significant Sources of Capital” section and the “Capital Spending” section, respectively. 75 Our debt balance at December 31, 2006, was $27.1 billion, an increase of approximately $14.6 billion during 2006. The increase reflects debt issuances of $15.3 billion during the first quarter of 2006 related to the acquisition of Burlington Resources. In addition, we assumed $4.3 billion of Burlington Resources debt, including the recognition of an increase of $406 million to record the debt at its fair value. In May 2006, we redeemed our $240 million 7.625% Notes upon their maturity. We also redeemed our $129 million 6.60% Notes due in 2007 (part of the debt assumed in the Burlington Resources acquisition), at a premium of $4 million, plus accrued interest. In October 2006, we redeemed our $1.25 billion 5.45% Notes upon their maturity. In addition, we redeemed our $500 million 5.60% Notes due December 2006, and our $350 million 5.70% Notes due March 2007 (both issues were a part of the debt assumed in the Burlington Resources acquisition), at a premium of $1 million, plus accrued interest. In order to finance the maturity and call of the above notes, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $1.25 billion of 5.625% Notes due 2016, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $500 million of 5.95% Notes due 2036, and $350 million of 5.30% Notes due 2012. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company guarantee the obligations of ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II. In December 2006, we terminated the lease of certain refining assets, which we consolidated due to our designation as the primary beneficiary of the lease entity. As part of the termination, we exercised a purchase option of the assets totaling $111 million and retired the related debt obligations of $104 million 5.847% Notes due 2006. An associated interest swap was also liquidated. During 2005, we announced three stock repurchase programs, which provided for the purchase of up to $3 billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years. Acquisitions for the share repurchase programs are made at management’s discretion at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the programs are held as treasury shares. During 2006, we purchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $964 million under the programs, including 542,000 shares at a cost of $39 million from a consolidated Burlington Resources grantor trust. On January 12, 2007, we announced a fourth $1 billion stock repurchase program under like terms as the other three programs. Through January 31, 2007, under the four programs, we had purchased a total of 50.5 million shares, at a cost of $3.1 billion. On February 9, 2007, we announced plans to purchase $4 billion of our common stock in 2007, including the $1 billion announced on January 12, 2007. We expect to purchase $1 billion in the first quarter of 2007. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $371 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. See the “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section for additional information on Qatargas 3. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $630 million for the construction of the facility. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $520 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. 76 In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. Production from the NMNG joint-venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL intends to complete an expansion of the terminal’s oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day to 240,000 barrels per day, with ConocoPhillips participating in the design and financing of the terminal expansion. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. We estimate our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to be approximately $460 million at current exchange rates, including interest to be accrued during construction. This amount will be adjusted as the project’s cost estimate and schedule are updated and the ruble exchange rate fluctuates. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $203 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the “Loans and advances—related parties” line on the balance sheet. On January 3, 2007, we closed on the previously announced business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we expect to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a ten-year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream joint venture formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. The remaining $7.3 billion contribution obligation will be reflected as a liability on our first quarter 2007 consolidated balance sheet. Principal and interest payments of $237 million will be made each quarter, beginning in the second quarter of 2007, and continuing until the balance is paid. The principal portion of these payments will be presented on our consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. Interest accrues at a rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. For additional information about this business venture, see Note 31—Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 15, 2007, we redeemed the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037, at a premium of $14 million, plus accrued interest. This redemption resulted in the immediate redemption by Phillips 66 Capital II of $350 million of 8% Capital Securities. See Note 15—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also, in January 2007, we redeemed our $153 million 7.25% Notes upon their maturity, and in February 2007, we reduced our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011 from $5 billion to $4 billion. Based on prevailing commodity price levels in early 2007, we anticipate reducing debt approximately $4 billion during 2007. In February 2007, we announced a quarterly dividend of 41 cents per share, representing a 14 percent increase over the previous quarter’s dividend of 36 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2007, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. In 2007, we anticipate our cash from operations will fund our capital and dividend programs, with excess cash being used for share repurchases and debt reduction. 77 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2006: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1 Year Year 2-3 Year 4-5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 27,090 1,598 1,685 12,640 11,167 Capital lease obligations 44 10 34 — — Total debt 27,134 1,608 1,719 12,640 11,167 Interest on debt 16,692 1,594 3,043 2,704 9,351 Operating lease obligations 3,041 584 931 530 996 Purchase obligations (b) 93,025 35,494 7,701 5,260 44,570 Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations 5,402 576 404 390 4,032 Accrued environmental costs 1,062 270 262 119 411 Total $ 146,356 40,126 14,060 21,643 70,527 (a) Includes $718 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

During the three-year period, 58 percent of total spending went to our E&P segment. In addition to our capital expenditures and investments spending during 2006, we also provided loans of approximately $800 million to certain affiliated companies. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2007 is $12.3 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 82 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 14 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies; and contributions, including applicable accrued interest, related to funding our portion of the EnCana transaction; our total capital program for 2007 is approximately $13.5 billion. See the “Capital Requirements” section, as well as Note 10—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 31—Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 79 E&P Capital spending for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, totaled $21.4 billion. The expenditures over the three-year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: · The West Sak and Alpine projects, and drilling of satellite field prospects in Alaska. · The Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. · The acquisition of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. · Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project and development of the Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada. · Development of the Corocoro field offshore Venezuela. · The Ekofisk Area growth project and Alvheim project in the Norwegian North Sea. · The Britannia satellite and Clair developments in the U.K. North Sea and Atlantic Margin, respectively. · The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan, including acquiring additional ownership interest. · The acquisition of an interest in OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL, and development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. · The Bayu-Undan gas recycle and liquefied natural gas development projects in the Timor Sea and northern Australia, respectively. · The Belanak, Suban, Kerisi, Hiu, Pangkah and Belut projects in Indonesia. · The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects. · Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System pump stations were also included in the E&P segment. UNITED STATES Alaska During the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, we made capital expenditures for development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine field, including Alpine’s first satellite fields—Nanuq and Fiord, and the West Sak development. The Nanuq and Fiord fields began production in 2006. Also during this three-year period, we completed both Phase I and Phase II of the Alpine Capacity Expansion project. In addition, we participated in exploratory drilling on the North Slope, including the Qannik discovery in 2006—the third Alpine satellite field, and acquired additional acreage. We also made capital expenditures for construction of double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. The fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker began Alaska North Slope service in February 2007. During 2004, we and our co-venturers in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade the pipeline’s pump stations. A phased startup of the project began in the first quarter of 2007. Lower 48 States In the Lower 48, we continued to develop our acreage positions in south Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, the Texas Panhandle, and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore we focused on 80 natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, the Lobo Trend of South Texas, the Bossier Trend of East Texas, the Barnett Shale Trend of North Texas, and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Offshore, we expended funds for the development of the Magnolia, Ursa and K-2 fields in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. CANADA In Canada, we continued with development of the Surmont heavy-oil project, where initial production is expected in the first half of 2007. Over the life of this 30-plus year project, we anticipate approximately 500 production and steam-injection well pairs will be drilled. We also continued with development of the Syncrude Stage III expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, where an upgrader expansion project was completed and became fully operational in 2006. In addition, capital expenditures were made on the development of our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves in western Canada, as well as to progress the Parsons Lake/Mackenzie gas project. SOUTH AMERICA In the Gulf of Paria, off the coast of Venezuela, funds were expended to construct a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel and to construct and install a wellhead platform in the Corocoro field. Development drilling began on the Corocoro project in the second quarter of 2006. Arrival of the FSO and completion of pipelines and the FSO mooring is planned for the first quarter of 2007. Field production is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2008 upon installation of the central processing platform. EUROPE In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, where production began in the fourth quarter of 2005; the U.K. Clair field, where production began in early 2005; the Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2008; and the Alvheim development project, where production is scheduled to begin in 2007. In September 2006, we announced the Jasmine discovery, a new gas and condensate field in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. Results from the discovery are being evaluated to determine the plan for appraisal drilling and development. AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST In late-December 2005, we announced, in conjunction with our co-venturers, an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation on the terms under which we would return to our former crude oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. As a part of that agreement, we made a payment of $520 million in January 2006 for the acquisition of an ownership interest in, and extension of, the concessions. In December 2006, approximately $200 million was paid for unamortized investments made since 1986, agreed to be paid as part of the 1986 standstill agreement to hold assets in escrow for the U.S.-based co-venturers. In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. Funding was also 81 provided for our share of the basic phase of the Brass LNG project for the front-end engineering and design and related activities to move the project to a final investment decision. RUSSIA AND CASPIAN Russia In June 2005, we acquired a 30 percent economic interest and a 50 percent governance interest in NMNG, a joint venture with LUKOIL to explore for and develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province, including development of the YK field. Caspian During the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, we invested funds to explore and develop the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the Caspian Sea. Construction activities to develop the field began in 2004. In 2005, we also expended funds to increase our ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 9.26 percent. ASIA PACIFIC Timor Sea and Australia In the Timor Sea and Australia, we invested funds for development activities associated with Phase I and Phase II of the Bayu-Undan natural gas project, including the development of an onshore LNG facility near Darwin, Australia. Production of liquids began from Phase I in February of 2004, and development drilling concluded at the end of March 2005. In 2006, the LNG facility was completed and began full operation. Indonesia In Indonesia, funds were used for the completion of the Belanak and Hiu fields in the South Natuna Sea Block B, including construction of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and associated gas plant facilities on the FPSO vessel. Oil production began from Belanak in late 2004 and first condensate production and gas exports began in June and October 2005, respectively. Natural gas production began from Hiu in late 2006. Also, in Block B funds were used to continue the development of the Kerisi and Belut fields. In South Sumatra, to prepare for the West Java gas sales agreement signed in August 2004, we continued the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant. China Following approval from the Chinese government in early 2005, we began development of Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25-6 field. The development of Peng Lai 19-3 and Peng Lai 25-6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO vessel. Offshore installation work associated with the first new wellhead platform (WHP-C) was ongoing at year-end 2006. Vietnam In Vietnam, we began development of the Su Tu Vang field in Block 15-1 in late 2005, and continued appraisal work at the Su Tu Trang field. Preliminary engineering of the Su Tu Den Northeast development began in 2006. On Block 15-2, we continued further development of our producing Rang Dong field, including developing the central part of the field, where two additional platforms were completed in 2005 and additional production and injection wells were completed in 2005 and 2006. 82 2007 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget is $10.1 billion, 6 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2006. Thirty-seven percent of E&P’s 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. We plan to spend $783 million in 2007 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations—including the Alpine satellite fields and the West Sak heavy-oil field, as well as exploration activities. In the Lower 48, expenditures will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, the Lobo Trend of South Texas, the Bossier Trend of East Texas, the Barnett Shale Trend of North Texas, and the Permian Basin of West Texas; and new project developments such as the Piceance Basin in northwest Colorado. Offshore capital will be focused mainly on the Ursa development. E&P is directing $6.4 billion of its 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2007 will be directed to developing major long-term projects, including the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the YK field in northern Russia, through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL; the Britannia satellites, the Ekofisk Area, and the Alvheim and Statfjord fields in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; heavy-oil and the Parsons Lake/Mackenzie gas projects in Canada, as well as western Canada natural gas projects; the Belanak, Kerisi, Hiu, Belut, Pangkah, and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; fields offshore Malaysia and Vietnam; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Waha concessions in Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 37 percent, 44 percent and 38 percent of our total net additions in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 18 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,976 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2006, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three-year period ending 2009 will be approximately 20 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $6.4 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively. Although it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2007 through 2009 are projected to be $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively. Approximately 75 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2006 were associated with nine major development areas and our investment in LUKOIL. Seven of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: · The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. · The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. · The Peng Lai 19-3 field in China. · Fields in the United States and Canada associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. 83 The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. Midstream Capital spending for Midstream during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DCP Midstream in 2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $6.1 billion, representing 17 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: · Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. · A sulfur removal technology (S Zorb™ SRT) unit at the Lake Charles refinery. · A fluid catalytic cracking gasoline hydrotreater at the Alliance refinery. · Integration of a crude unit and coker adjacent to our Wood River refinery. · A hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. · Expansion of existing hydrotreaters for both low-sulfur gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel, with the addition of a new hydrogen plant at the Bayway refinery. · A new ultra-low-sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Sweeny refinery. · A new ultra-low-sulfur diesel hydrotreater and hydrogen plant at the Billings refinery. · Revamp of an existing hydrotreater for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and a new hydrogen plant at the Wood River refinery. · A new hydrotreater for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and a hydrogen plant at the Ponca City refinery. · Revamps of existing hydrotreaters for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the Los Angeles, Trainer and Ferndale refineries. Major construction activities in progress include: · A new vacuum unit, coker and revamps of heavy oil and distillate hydrotreaters at the Borger refinery. · A new S Zorb™ SRT unit at the Wood River refinery. · Development of an additional coker at the Wood River refinery. · U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The 2006 acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery added 260,000 barrels per day to our crude oil refining capacity. 2007 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2007 capital budget is $1.7 billion, a 42 percent decrease from actual spending in 2006, reflecting the 2006 acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Domestic spending in 2007 is expected to comprise 73 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $1.1 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects 84 related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on reliability, energy efficiency, capital maintenance and regulatory compliance. Work will continue on projects to increase crude oil capacity, expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $150 million. Internationally, we plan to spend $471 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as the advancement of a full-conversion refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. Other international refinery projects remain under study. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, was for our initial purchase of an ownership interest in LUKOIL and continued purchases to increase our ownership interest. No additional purchases are expected in 2007. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October 2004. Planned spending in 2007 is primarily for an expansion of the Immingham plant. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Environmental We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: · Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. · Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. · Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. · Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. · Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. 85 · Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. · Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. · U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation on sulfur content in highway diesel became effective in June 2006 with ConocoPhillips refineries producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel on schedule. The sulfur content regulation for non-road diesel, as promulgated in June 2004, further lowers the sulfur content of non-road diesel fuel beginning in June 2007. Capital strategy and market integration plans have incorporated this sulfur content step-down to ensure ongoing integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non-road markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. Implementing regulations are currently being developed by the EPA to identify individual company utilization and compliance procedures needed to meet these obligations. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies to meet the projected requirements. In addition, we are investigating innovative technologies for the production of biofuels that may facilitate compliance. Since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, there have been a range of national, sub-national and international regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction. These actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Regulation in this field continues to evolve and while it is likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs. A recent example of such proposed regulation is California’s Assembly Bill 32, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market 86 mechanisms that will ultimately reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. The overall long-term fiscal impact from this type of regulation is uncertain. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2005, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 66 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2006, we had resolved nine of these sites, had received six new notices of potential liability, and had reopened one site, leaving 64 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $912 million in 2006 and are expected to be about $967 million in 2007 and $984 million in 2008. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,118 million in 2006 and are expected to be about $945 million and $1,082 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. 87 We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2006. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2006, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,062 million, compared with $989 million at December 31, 2005. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We use fair value measurements to measure, among other items, purchased assets and investments, leases, derivative contracts and financial guarantees. We also use them to assess impairment of properties, plants and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. The Statement does not apply to share-based payment transactions and inventory pricing. This Statement is effective January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). This Interpretation provides guidance on 88 recognition, classification, and disclosure concerning uncertain tax liabilities. The evaluation of a tax position will require recognition of a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination. This Interpretation is effective beginning January 1, 2007. We have completed our analysis and concluded the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an admendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158). We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of this new Statement as of December 31, 2006, and the impact from these changes is reflected in Note 23—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The requirement in SFAS No. 158 to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The measurement date for our pension plan in the United Kingdom will be changed from September 30 to December 31 in time to comply with the Statement’s 2008 required implementation date. All other plans are presently measured at December 31 of each year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2006, 89 the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,313 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $238 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 62 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 3.5 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2007 would increase by approximately $19 million. The remaining $3,615 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2006 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion is concentrated in ten major assets. Management expects less than $100 million to move to proved properties in 2007. Most of the remaining value is associated with Parsons Lake/Mackenzie, Alaska North Slope and Australia natural gas projects, on which we continue to work with partners and regulatory agencies in order to develop. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2006, total suspended well costs were $537 million, compared with $339 million at year-end 2005. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 11—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. 90 Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year-end 2006 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2005 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occur subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our 20.6 percent equity-method share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas proved reserves at year-end 2006 were estimated based on LUKOIL’s prior-year report (adjusted for known additions, license extensions, dispositions, and other related information) and included adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provided for estimated 2006 production. Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves. The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2006, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $63 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2006 was approximately $6.2 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 5.2 billion BOE at the beginning of 2006 and were 6.4 billion BOE at the end of 2006. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 251 million barrels at the beginning of 2006 and were 243 million barrels at the end of 2006. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2006 would have been increased by an estimated $324 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $215 million, $4 million and $67 million, respectively. Of these write-downs, $131 million in 2006, $1 million in 2005 and $52 million in 2004 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying 91 value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 13—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 14—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 18—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2006, we had $736 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a 92 prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 12—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. At December 31, 2006, we had $31.5 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Within our E&P segment and our R&M segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year-end 2006, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 25 percent to 69 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in an impairment. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental 93 agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $110 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moody’s Aa corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. OUTLOOK EnCana Joint Ventures In October 2006, we announced a business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana), to create an integrated North American heavy-oil business. The transaction closed on January 3, 2007. The venture consists of two 50/50 operating joint ventures, a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited liability company, WRB Refining LLC. We plan to use the equity method of accounting for our investments in both joint ventures. FCCL Oil Sands Partnership’s operating assets consist of EnCana’s Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeast Alberta. EnCana is the operator and managing partner of this joint venture. We expect to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to the joint venture over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. This interest-bearing cash contribution obligation will be recorded as a liability on our first quarter 2007 balance sheet. WRB Refining LLC’s operating assets consist of our Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. This joint venture plans to expand heavy-oil processing capacity at these facilities from 60,000 barrels per day to approximately 550,000 barrels per day by 2015. Total crude oil throughput at these two facilities is expected to increase from the current 452,000 barrels per day to approximately 600,000 barrels per day over the same time period. We are the operator and managing partner of this joint venture. EnCana is expected to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest to the joint venture over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. For the Wood River refinery, operating results will be shared 50/50 starting upon formation. For the Borger refinery, we are entitled to 85 percent of the operating results in 2007, 65 percent in 2008, and 50 percent in all years thereafter. Alaska We and our co-venturers continue to seek agreement with the state of Alaska on fiscal terms that would enable development of a pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to markets in the U.S. Lower 48 states. Alaska’s new governor has stated her administration will propose a new law in the Alaska legislature and seek new proposals for development of an Alaskan gas pipeline. We expect to be actively involved in this process throughout 2007. In June 2006, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ruled in a proceeding involving a method for compensating shippers according to the quality of crude oil they ship through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (quality bank). The rulings establish new valuation methodologies and require adjustments to quality bank payments retroactive to February 1, 2000. Based on our evaluations of the rulings, and taking into account contractual provisions with our crude oil customers regarding quality bank payments, our December 31, 2006, balance sheet contains a current 94 liability for our required retroactive payments to the quality bank, and a current receivable for amounts due from our crude oil customers. There was no impact to our 2006 results of operations related to this matter. In January 2007, we and our co-venturer jointly filed for a two-year extension of the Kenai LNG plant’s export license with the U.S. Department of Energy. This application would extend the export license through March 31, 2011. Venezuela Our operations in Venezuela include two heavy-oil projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt (Petrozuata and Hamaca) and one conventional oil development (Corocoro). Over the past several years, our operating results have been negatively impacted by developments in Venezuela, including work disruptions, currency exchange controls, royalty rate increases, tax increases, and production quotas. More recently, Venezuelan government officials have made public statements about increasing their ownership interests in heavy-oil projects required to give the national oil company of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), control and up to 60 percent ownership interests. On January 31, 2007, Venezuela’s National Assembly passed an “enabling law” allowing the president to pass laws by decree on certain matters, including those associated with heavy-oil production from the Orinoco Oil Belt. PDVSA holds a 49.9 percent interest in the Petrozuata heavy-oil project and a 30 percent interest in the Hamaca heavy-oil project. We have a 50.1 percent interest and a 40 percent interest in the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects, respectively. The impact, if any, of these statements or other potential government actions, on our Petrozuata and Hamaca projects is not determinable at this time, but could include future reductions of our operating results, production and proved reserves. The Petrozuata joint venture has received a preliminary audit report from the Venezuelan tax authorities, which if upheld, would result in additional income taxes of $245 million for 2002, plus interest and penalty. Petrozuata has also received an audit report claiming that it owes municipal sales tax and interest of $170 million for the period 2000 through 2005. Petrozuata believes, in both cases, these audit findings are not supported in law and it therefore does not owe these taxes. Accordingly, no provision has been established by Petrozuata. In addition, the Venezuelan tax authorities have announced their intention to accelerate the income tax audits of both Petrozuata and Hamaca for the years 2003 through 2006. ConocoPhillips continues to preserve all of its rights under contracts, investment treaties, and international law and will continue to evaluate its options in realizing the value of its investments and operations in Venezuela. Our total assets invested in Venezuelan operations at December 31, 2006, was approximately $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2006, we had recorded 1,088 million BOE of proved reserves related to Hamaca and Petrozuata, and these joint ventures produced 101,000 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2006. Other The U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) contained a variety of provisions designed to strengthen the funding rules for U.S. defined benefit pension plans including the imposition of certain benefit limitations on U.S. tax-qualified pensions that are less than 80 percent funded, based on the PPA’s new funding liability. While the inputs to the PPA’s new funding liability have not been completely specified at this time, we expect the PPA liability to be generally similar in concept to Current Liability as defined by section 412 (l) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is now used in pension funding calculations. On a Current Liability basis, on average our U.S. tax-qualified pensions were 95 percent funded for the plan year beginning January 1, 2006. In December 2006, we and LUKOIL reached a definitive agreement for LUKOIL to purchase 376 of our fueling stations in six countries in Europe. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007, following review by relevant authorities. 95 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: · Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business.· The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures.· Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance.· Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities.· Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance.· Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining.· Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products.· Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products.· Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance.· Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG and refinery projects and related facilities.· Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism.· International monetary conditions and exchange controls.· Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.· Liability resulting from litigation.· General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities, changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, and international monetary fluctuations. 96 · Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business.· Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes.· Our ability to successfully integrate the operations of Burlington Resources into our own operations. 97 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: · Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.· Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.· Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions.· Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2006, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those 98 instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Floating Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Year-End 2006 2007 $ 557 7.43 % $ 1,000 5.37 % 2008 32 6.96 — — 2009 307 6.43 1,250 5.47 2010 1,433 8.85 — — 2011 3,175 6.74 7,944 5.53 Remaining years 9,983 6.57 691 4.29 Total $ 15,487 $ 10,885 Fair value $ 16,856 $ 10,885 Year-End 2005 2006 $ 1,534 5.73 % $ 180 5.32 % 2007 170 7.24 — — 2008 27 6.99 — — 2009 304 6.43 — — 2010 1,280 8.73 41 4.51 Remaining years 7,830 6.45 721 3.71 Total $ 11,145 $ 942 Fair value $ 12,484 $ 942 At the beginning of 2005, we held certain interest rate swaps that converted $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate. Under SFAS No. 133, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012, but during 2005 we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps as we redeemed the associated debt. This reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to floating by the end of 2005 to $350 million. These remaining swaps continue to qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so we will not recognize any gain or loss due to ineffectiveness, if any, in the hedges. 99 Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Interest Rate Derivatives Expected Maturity Date Notional Average Pay Rate Average Receive Rate Year-End 2006 2007—variable to fixed $ — — % — % 2008 — — — 2009 — — — 2010 — — — 2011 — — — Remaining years—fixed to variable 350 5.57 4.75 Total $ 350 Fair value position $ (10 ) Year-End 2005 2006—variable to fixed $ 116 5.85 % 4.10 % 2007 — — — 2008 — — — 2009 — — — 2010 — — — Remaining years—fixed to variable 350 4.35 4.75 Total $ 466 Fair value position $ (8 ) Foreign Currency Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2006 or 2005, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as follows: 100 In Millions Foreign Currency Swaps Notional* Fair Market Value** 2006 2005 2006 2005 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 242 492 $ 5 (8 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 647 463 20 (12 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 1,367 517 (19 ) — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD 7 — — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 17 3 — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 1,145 1,210 15 (15 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 108 107 — 1 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Slovakia koruna USD 2 — — — Sell U.S. dollar, buy Hungary forint USD 4 — — — Buy U.S. dollar, sell Polish zloty USD — 3 — — Sell euro, buy Norwegian kroner EUR 10 — — — Buy euro, sell Norwegian kroner EUR — 2 — — Buy euro, sell Swedish krona EUR — 11 — — Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 125 — — — *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings. Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. /s/ James J. Mulva /s/ John A. Carrig James J.

1163165,COP,CONOCOPHILLIPS,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes, and supplemental oil and gas disclosures included elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the company’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “effort,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 63.The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips.Business Environment and Executive OverviewConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading E&P companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 13 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; LNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 9,500 people worldwide and had total assets of $94 billion.Overview In 2022, the energy landscape continued to improve with commodity prices ultimately reaching a 10-year high before decreasing in the second half of the year due to macroeconomic concerns. We expect prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile. Our view is that a successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain highly disciplined in our investment decisions and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with the conflict in Ukraine, OPEC Plus supply updates, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation, supply chain disruptions and the fluctuating global COVID-19 impacts.The macro-environment, including the energy transition, continues to evolve. We believe ConocoPhillips will continue to play an essential role by executing on three objectives: responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. We call this our Triple Mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders.Our value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles is guided by foundational principles that support our Triple Mandate. Our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance.Our actions throughout 2022 reinforced our differential value proposition. Demonstrating our commitment to maintaining and enhancing balance sheet strength, in 2022, we executed several activities focused on debt reduction, including early retiring and refinancing some of our debt. In aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. These activities facilitate our ability to achieve our previously announced $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of 2026, while also reducing the company's annual cash interest expense. See Note 9.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K32Management’s Discussion and AnalysisTable of ContentsTotal company production in 2022 was 1,738 MBOED, yielding cash provided by operating activities of $28.3 billion. We invested $10.2 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately $15.0 billion through our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our VROC. For 2022, we returned $2.4 billion from our ordinary dividend, which included an increase from 46 cents per share to 51 cents per share, effective in December. We also returned $3.3 billion to shareholders from the VROC in 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the paced monetization program of our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares and used the proceeds for a portion of our share repurchase program. See Note 5. In total for 2022, we returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $25 billion to $45 billion to support our plan for future share repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased $23.4 billion of the $45 billion authorized share repurchase program. In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. We also declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share and a VROC of $0.60 cents per share. In 2022, we took several steps to expand our global LNG business. In the first quarter, we increased our equity share in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) by 10 percent to 47.5 percent. See Note 3. We were also awarded a 25 percent interest in each of two new joint ventures with QatarEnergy that will participate in the North Field East (NFE) and North Field South (NFS) LNG projects. Formation of the NFE joint venture (QG8) closed in December 2022 and we anticipate that the formation of the NFS joint venture (QG12) will close in early 2023. Also, in 2022, we executed a 15-year regasification agreement at the recently announced German LNG Terminal at Brunsbuttel.Domestically, in November 2022, we entered into several agreements with Sempra entities in connection with the Port Arthur LNG (PALNG) facility, including a Sales and Purchase Agreement for 5 MTPA of LNG offtake at the start-up of Phase 1 of the PALNG facility, and an Equity Sale and Purchase Agreement, whereby we will acquire 30 percent of the equity in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG. Development of the PALNG facility is subject to completing required commercial agreements and resolving a number of risks and uncertainties, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors. As part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts, in the first quarter of 2022, we completed two transactions in our Asia Pacific segment, including the above-mentioned acquisition of additional interest in APLNG as well as the sale of our interests in Indonesia. In addition to those transactions, throughout 2022, we completed the sale of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment. For more information on APLNG, see Note 4 and for more information on dispositions, see Note 3.In 2022, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to demonstrate responsible and reliable ESG performance by publishing our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the 'Plan'), which is built upon our Triple Mandate. In addition, we continue to expand upon our Paris-aligned climate risk framework that we adopted in 2020. In July 2022, we joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 initiative. In October 2022, we demonstrated further evidence of our commitment by setting a new 2030 methane emissions intensity target of approximately 0.15 percent of gas produced, consistent with our commitment to OGMP 2.0. For more information on our commitment to ESG and the Plan, see ""Contingencies—Company Response to Climate-Related Risks"" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. Production increased 171 MBOED or 11 percent in 2022, compared to 2021. Production for 2022 was 1,738 MBOED. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, the conversion of previously acquired Concho-contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis and 2021 Winter Storm Uri impacts, production decreased by 16 MBOED or 1 percent. Organic growth from Lower 48 and other development programs more than offset decline; however, production was lower overall, primarily due to fourth quarter weather impacts and downtime in Lower 48.33ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KManagement’s Discussion and AnalysisTable of ContentsKey Operating and Financial SummarySignificant items during 2022 and recent announcements included the following:•Generated cash provided by operating activities of $28.3 billion; ended the year with cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6.7 billion and short-term investments of $2.8 billion;•Distributed $15 billion to shareholders through three-tier framework including $5.7 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend and VROC and $9.3 billion through share repurchases, representing 53 percent of cash provided by operating activities;•Expanded global LNG business through participation in QatarEnergy's NFE and NFS projects; executed 15-year regasification agreement at German LNG Terminal; acquired additional 10 percent interest in APLNG; signed 20-year agreement for 5 MTPA of LNG offtake and executed agreement to purchase 30 percent equity stake in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG;•Delivered full-year production of 1,738 MBOED and record Lower 48 production;•Fully integrated acquired Permian assets and executed multiple acreage swaps, coring up approximately 25,000 acres since acquisition to provide over a year's worth of additional two mile-plus long-lateral drilling inventory;•Received license extension for Norway's Greater Ekofisk area to 2048 and license adjustments for China's Bohai Penglai Fields to 2039;•Generated $3.5 billion in disposition proceeds through monetization of the company's CVE shares and noncore asset sales;•Retired $3.3 billion in debt toward the company's $5 billion debt reduction target;•Joined OGMP 2.0; published a Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition and set a new 2030 methane emissions intensity target, enhancing our commitment to ESG;•Recorded 2022 year-end proved reserves of 6.6 billion BOE, with a total reserve replacement ratio of 176 percent including closed acquisitions and dispositions.Business EnvironmentWTI crude oil prices averaged $94 per barrel in 2022, compared with $68 per barrel in 2021. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist in the future. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability, reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business and distributions to shareholders. We are guided by our Triple Mandate and our foundational principles to deliver on our differential value proposition to create value through price cycles. Our foundational principles include maintaining balance sheet strength, peer leading distributions, disciplined investments and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance, all of which support strong financial returns.•Balance sheet strength. A strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles. We strive to maintain our ‘A’-rating, and in 2021 committed to reducing gross debt by $5 billion by the end of 2026. In 2022 we executed several activities focused on debt reduction and, combined with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. This will reduce interest expense and provide resilience in periods of volatility. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6.7 billion and short-term investments of $2.8 billion, maintaining balance sheet strength.•Peer leading distributions. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our VROC. This framework is how we plan to return greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $5.7 billion to shareholders through our ordinary dividend and VROC and $9.3 billion through share repurchases partially sourced from monetization of our CVE common shares. See Note 5. Our combined dividends and share repurchases of $15 billion represented over 50 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion to support our plan for future share repurchases. In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.”•Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production. We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles. Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K34Management’s Discussion and AnalysisTable of Contents◦Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline. Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&A. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth’s sake. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders. ◦Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. ◦Optimize our portfolio. In 2022, we expanded upon our global LNG business by increasing our ownership in APLNG by 10 percent to 47.5 percent. In addition, we were also awarded interests in the NFE and NFS LNG projects in Qatar, signed agreements to purchase an interest in Port Arthur LNG in the U.S., and signed a 15-year regasification agreement with the German LNG Terminal at Brunsbuttel. See Note 4.We continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that do not compete. As such, in 2022 we completed the sale of Indonesia and certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment. See Note 3.◦Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:▪Acquire interest in existing or new fields.▪Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.▪Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. Our reserve replacement was 176 percent in 2022, reflecting a net increase from development drilling activity as well as higher prices. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes a net decrease of 6 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was 177 percent in 2022. In the three years ended December 31, 2022, our reserve replacement was 180 percent. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2022, which excludes a net increase of 1,103 MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 114 percent. See ""Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations"" for more information.Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as lower commodity price cycles can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years. 35ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KManagement’s Discussion and AnalysisTable of Contents•Environmental Social and Governance. ConocoPhillips seeks to fulfill our mission of delivering energy to the world through an integrated management system approach that assesses sustainability-related business risks and opportunities as part of our decision-making process. Recognizing the importance of ESG performance to our stakeholders and company success, we have a governance structure that extends from the board of directors through to executive leadership and business unit managers.In October 2020, we became the first U.S.-based oil and natural gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk framework that includes an ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a gross operated and net equity basis by 2050. We believe that this framework, combined with our success in meeting the business objectives set by our Triple Mandate, represents the most effective way for us to sustainably contribute to society’s transition to a low-carbon economy. In early 2022, we reaffirmed and improved our commitment to demonstrate responsible and reliable ESG performance and address climate-related risks by publishing our Plan for the Net Zero Energy Transition, which outlines our approach and progress to address risks specific to the energy transition. ConocoPhillips believes that natural gas and oil will remain essential to the energy mix throughout the energy transition, and we also recognize the need for continuous reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity of production operations. The energy transition will likely be complex, evolving over multiple decades with many possible pathways and uncertainties. By following our Triple Mandate, we intend to meet this challenge in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that creates long-term value for our stakeholders. For more information on our commitment to responsible and reliable ESG performance through the energy transition, see ""Contingencies—Company Response to Climate-Related Risks"" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.Commodity PricesOur earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. Commodity price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, global health crises and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas over the past three years:Brent crude oil prices averaged $101.19 per barrel in 2022, an increase of 43 percent compared with $70.73 per barrel in 2021. Similarly, average WTI crude oil prices increased 39 percent from $67.92 per barrel in 2021 to $94.23 per barrel in 2022. Prices were higher through 2022 due to ongoing global economic recovery following 2020's COVID impacts, supply disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions, OPEC supply restraint and supply chain bottlenecks limiting U.S. production growth.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K36Management’s Discussion and AnalysisTable of ContentsHenry Hub natural gas prices increased 73 percent from an average of $3.85 per MMBTU in 2021 to $6.65 per MMBTU in 2022. Natural gas prices increased due to modest growth in domestic production, healthy domestic demand and strong levels of feedgas demand for LNG exports to Europe and Asia.Our realized bitumen price increased 48 percent from an average of $37.52 per barrel in 2021 to $55.56 per barrel in 2022. The increase was largely driven by strength in WTI, reflective of increasing global demand and sanctions on Russian exports. The weakness of WCS to WTI differential at Hardisty was primarily caused by U.S. strategic petroleum reserve release, discounted Russian crude oil and weak heavy fuel pricing. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through optimizing diluent recover unit operation, blending and transportation strategies. Our worldwide annual average realized price increased 46 percent from $54.63 per BOE in 2021 to $79.82 per BOE in 2022 primarily due to higher commodity prices. OutlookProduction and Capital2023 operating plan capital expenditure guidance is $10.7 to $11.3 billion, which includes $1.6 to $2.0 billion for anticipated major project spending at NFE, NFS, PALNG and Willow and $9.1 to $9.3 billion for ongoing development drilling programs; exploration and appraisal activities; base maintenance; and projects to reduce the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and fund investments in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions. Production guidance is 1.76 to 1.80 MMBOED in 2023. First quarter 2023 production is expected to be 1.72 MMBOED to 1.76 MMBOED, which includes 35 MBOED of turnaround and stabilizer expansion in Eagle Ford.Operating SegmentsWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.37ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KResults of Operations Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThis section of the Form 10-K discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021.

Earnings were positively impacted by:•Higher realized commodity prices.•Higher sales volumes primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition, partly offset by assets divested. See Note 3. •Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices and volumes as well as the additional 10 percent interest in APLNG we acquired in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 3. •Absence of a $682 million after-tax impairment of our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7.•Recognition of a $515 million tax benefit related to the closing of an IRS audit. See Note 17.•Gain on dispositions primarily due to a $462 million after-tax gain related to the divestiture of our Indonesia assets, higher contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and the absence of a $137 million after-tax loss related to the divestiture of noncore assets in our Other International segment from 2021. See Note 3.•Absence of restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax related to our Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions.•Absence of realized losses on hedges of $233 million after-tax related to derivative positions acquired in our Concho acquisition. See Note 12.•Lower other expenses primarily related to an after-tax gain of $62 million associated with the extinguishment of debt from the first quarter of 2022. See Note 9.These increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:•Higher income tax provision.•Higher taxes other than income taxes, production and operating expenses and DD&A expenses due to higher prices, production volumes, primarily from our Shell Permian acquisition, and inflation. Partially offsetting the increase in DD&A expenses were lower rates from reserve revisions.•A gain of $251 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2022, as compared to a $1,040 million after-tax gain on those shares in 2021. See Note 5.•Absence of an after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a final investment decision (FID) bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture in 2020. See Note 11.•Higher exploration expenses primarily related to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells in our Canada segment and increased dry hole expenses in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. See Note 6.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K38Results of Operations Table of ContentsIncome Statement AnalysisUnless otherwise indicated, all results in Income Statement Analysis are before-tax.Sales and other operating revenues increased $32,666 million in 2022, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes, primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition, partially offset by assets divested. See Note 3. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1,249 million in 2022, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices as well as the additional 10 percent interest in APLNG which was acquired in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 3.Gain on dispositions increased $591 million in 2022, primarily due to the recognition of a gain of $534 million from our Indonesia divestiture, the absence of a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment and higher contingent payments in our Canada and Lower 48 segments than in 2021. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a $200 million gain for a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture recognized in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3.Other income (loss) decreased $699 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains associated with our CVE common shares which were fully divested in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 5. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income earned due to rising rates and investments.Purchased commodities increased $15,813 million in 2022, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes. Production and operating expenses increased $1,312 million in 2022, due to higher volumes, primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition, inflation and commodity price impacts.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $96 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.Exploration expenses increased $220 million in 2022, primarily due to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells in our Canada segment as well as increased dry hole expenses related to our 2022 exploration and appraisal campaign in Norway.DD&A increased $296 million in 2022 mainly due to higher overall production volumes primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition, partially offset by lower rates from reserve additions from development drilling and higher prices and the absence of DD&A from divested assets.Impairments decreased $686 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of an impairment of our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021. For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13. Taxes other than income taxes increased $1,730 million in 2022, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes.Other Expenses decreased $149 million primarily related to a gain of $127 million associated with the extinguishment of debt from the first quarter of 2022. See Note 9.See Note 17—Income Taxes for information regarding our income tax provision and effective tax rate.39ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KResults of Operations Table of ContentsSummary Operating Statistics202220212020Average Net ProductionCrude oil (MBD)Consolidated Operations885 816 555 Equity affiliates13 13 13 Total crude oil898 829 568 Natural gas liquids (MBD)Consolidated Operations244 134 97 Equity affiliates8 8 8 Total natural gas liquids252 142 105 Bitumen (MBD)66 69 55 Natural gas (MMCFD)Consolidated Operations1,939 2,109 1,339 Equity affiliates1,191 1,053 1,055 Total natural gas3,130 3,162 2,394 Total Production (MBOED)1,738 1,567 1,127 Dollars Per UnitAverage Sales PricesCrude oil (per bbl)Consolidated Operations$97.23 67.61 39.56 Equity affiliates97.31 69.45 39.02 Total crude oil97.23 67.64 39.54 Natural gas liquids (per bbl)Consolidated Operations35.67 31.04 12.90 Equity affiliates61.22 54.16 32.69 Total natural gas liquids36.50 32.45 14.61 Bitumen (per bbl)55.56 37.52 8.02 Natural gas (per mcf)Consolidated Operations10.56 6.00 3.17 Equity affiliates10.67 5.31 3.71 Total natural gas10.60 5.77 3.41 Millions of DollarsWorldwide Exploration ExpensesGeneral and administrative; geological and geophysical, lease rental, and other$224 300 374 Leasehold impairment89 10 868 Dry holes251 34 215 Total Exploration Expenses$564 344 1,457 ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K40Results of Operations Table of ContentsWe explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs on a worldwide basis.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillipsAsia Pacific reported earnings of $2,736 million in 2022, compared with $453 million in 2021. The increase in earnings was mainly due to:•Higher equity in earnings of affiliates reflecting higher LNG sales prices as well as our increased interest in APLNG.•Absence of a $688 million after-tax impairment on our APLNG investment. See Note 4 and Note 13.•Higher realized crude prices. •After-tax gain of $534 million associated with the divestiture of our Indonesian assets. See Note 3.•Lower DD&A expenses driven by the divestiture of our Indonesia assets. •Lower production and operating expenses primarily associated with the divestiture of our Indonesia assets and lower production costs in China.Earnings were negatively impacted by:•Absence of an after-tax gain of $200 million recognized in the first quarter of 2021 related to a contingent payment from our Australia-West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 and Note 11.•Lower sales volumes primarily due to the divestiture of our Indonesia assets.•Higher taxes other than income taxes primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices.Consolidated ProductionAverage consolidated production decreased 45 MBOED in 2022, compared with 2021. The decrease was primarily due to:•The divestiture of our Indonesia assets in the first quarter of 2022. •Normal field decline.These production decreases were partly offset by development activity at Bohai Bay in China and new wells online in Malaysia.Asset Acquisitions and DispositionsIn the first quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG increasing our ownership to 47.5 percent. Also in the first quarter, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Indonesia assets and operations. Production from the disposed assets averaged approximately 33 MBOED in the three-months ended March 31, 2022.

Earnings from our Other International operations improved $56 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $137 million after-tax loss on divestiture related to our Argentina exploration interests, partially offset by higher taxes related to legal settlements in 2022.Corporate and OtherMillions of Dollars202220212020Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillipsNet interest expense$(600)(801)(662)Corporate general and administrative expenses(244)(317)(200)Technology32 25 (26)Other income (expense)482 883 (992)$(330)(210)(1,880)Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense improved $201 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to higher interest income as well as lower interest expenses as a result of our debt reduction transactions. See Note 9.Corporate G&A expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These expenses decreased by $73 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to the absence of restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition, partially offset by mark-to-market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs. See Note 16.Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG.Other income (expense) (""Other"") includes certain corporate tax-related items, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in “Other” decreased by $401 million in 2022 compared with 2021. This was primarily due to a gain of $251 million on our CVE common shares in 2022, compared with a $1,040 million gain in 2021. Earnings in ""Other"" also decreased due to a $101 million tax impact associated with the disposition of our Indonesia assets and higher legal accruals of $81 million. Offsetting the decreases to earnings in ""Other"" include a $474 million federal tax benefit associated with the closing of the 2017 audit of our U.S. federal income tax return, the absence of a release of a $92 million deferred tax asset associated with prior dispositions and recognizing an after-tax gain of $62 million associated with the debt restructuring transactions. 47ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KCapital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsCapital Resources and LiquidityFinancial IndicatorsMillions of DollarsExcept as Indicated202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$28,314 16,996 4,802 Cash and cash equivalents6,458 5,028 2,991 Short-term investments2,785 446 3,609 Short-term debt417 1,200 619 Total debt16,643 19,934 15,369 Total equity48,003 45,406 29,849 Percent of total debt to capital*26 %31 34 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt2 %4 7 *Capital includes total debt and total equity.To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2022, the primary uses of our available cash were $10.2 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $9.3 billion to repurchase common stock, $5.7 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and VROC, $3.4 billion to reduce debt through refinancing transactions and retirements and $2.6 billion net purchases of investments. In 2022, cash and cash equivalents increased by over $1.4 billion to $6.5 billion.At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion, short-term investments of $2.8 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion, totaling approximately $14.8 billion of liquidity. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Changes in CapitalOperating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities continued to increase in 2022 totaling $28.3 billion, compared with $17.0 billion for 2021, and $4.8 billion for 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2021 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices, higher sales volumes mostly due to our acquisition of Shell Permian assets and the absence of the 2021 settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from Concho. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by foreign tax and royalty payments in Libya and foreign tax payments in Norway in addition to U.S. tax payments.The increase in cash from 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes, mostly resulting from our acquisition of Concho. The increase was partly offset by the $0.8 billion in settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from Concho and approximately $0.4 billion of transaction and restructuring costs.Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K48Capital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsThe level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged 1,738 MBOED in 2022, an increase of 171 MBOED or 11 percent compared to 2021. First quarter 2023 production is expected to be 1.72 MMBOED to 1.76 MMBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production. For information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in “Supplementary Data – Oil and Gas Operations.” See “Item 1A—Risk Factors – Unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.”As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.Investing ActivitiesIn 2022, we invested $10.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments; $2.1 billion of which was acquisition capital for the additional 10 percent interest in APLNG, certain Lower 48 assets and the payments toward our investment in QG8. The remaining $8.1 billion funded our operating capital program inclusive of growth in the Lower 48 segment through the integration of Concho and Shell Permian assets. Capital expenditures invested in 2021 and 2020 were $5.3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. See the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section. In 2022, we completed the monetization of our investment in CVE common shares that we began in May 2021. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, we fully divested of our investment, recognizing proceeds of $1.4 billion and directing proceeds toward our existing share repurchase program. Since inception, we generated total proceeds of $2.5 billion. See Note 5. Other proceeds from dispositions received in the current year include our divestitures in Asia Pacific and Lower 48 segments for approximately $1.5 billion after customary adjustments and $500 million in contingent payments associated with prior divestitures. See Note 3.In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell’s assets in the Delaware Basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments. We funded this transaction with cash on hand. We completed our acquisition of Concho on January 15, 2021 in an all-stock transaction. The assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash. The net impact of these items is recognized within “Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired” on our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 3.In 2021, total proceeds from asset dispositions were $1.7 billion. We received cash proceeds of $250 million from the sale of noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment and $1.1 billion from sales of our investment in CVE common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. See Note 3 and Note 5. In 2020, proceeds from asset sales were $1.3 billion. We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations. We also received proceeds of $359 million and $184 million from the sale of our Niobrara interests and Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, respectively. See Note 3. We invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. See Note 12 and Note 19.49ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KCapital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesIn February 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an expiration date of February 2027. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date.Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.The revolving credit facility supports ConocoPhillips Company’s ability to issue up to $5.5 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022.Our debt balance at December 31, 2022 was $16.6 billion compared with $19.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The current portion of debt, including payments for finance leases, is $0.4 billion. In 2022, we repurchased notes, retired floating rate debt, and executed a debt refinancing comprised of concurrent transactions including new debt issuances, a cash tender offer and debt exchange offers. In aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. The refinancing facilitates our ability to achieve our previously announced $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of 2026 while also reducing the company's annual cash interest expense. The current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:•Fitch: “A” with a “stable” outlook•S&P: “A-” with a “stable” outlook•Moody's: ""A2"" with a ""stable"" outlookSee Note 9 for additional information on debt, revolving credit facility and credit ratings.We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had direct bank letters of credit of $368 million and $337 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K50Capital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsCapital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section.Our debt balance at December 31, 2022, was $16.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the balance at December 31, 2021 of $19.9 billion. As part of our objective to maintain a strong balance sheet, we announced in 2021 our intention to reduce our total debt by $5 billion by the end of 2026. In 2022, we executed concurrent debt refinancing transactions, repurchased existing notes and retired floating rate notes upon natural maturity, that in aggregate reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion and progressed the achievement of our debt reduction target while also lowering our annual cash interest expense and extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio. See Note 9. In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. We plan to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend, through-cycle share repurchases and a VROC payment. The VROC provides a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. Our 2022 total capital returned was $15 billion.Consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, in 2022, we paid ordinary dividends of $1.89 per common share and VROC payments of $2.60 per common share. This was an increase over 2021 and 2020, when we paid only ordinary dividends of $1.75 and $1.69 per common share, respectively. In February 2023, we declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share and a VROC of $0.60 cents per share. The ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share is payable March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record on February 14, 2023. The VROC of $0.60 cents per share is payable April 14, 2023, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2023.The ordinary dividend and VROC are subject to numerous considerations and will be determined and approved each quarter by the Board of Directors. If approved, we expect to announce the VROC when we announce our ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payouts will be staggered from the ordinary dividend and paid in the subsequent quarter, resulting in up to eight cash distributions throughout the year. In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of our common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. Share repurchases were $9.3 billion, $3.6 billion, and $0.9 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 334.8 million shares and $23.4 billion. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.For more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see “Item 1A—Risk Factors – Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.” As of December 31, 2022, in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $19.2 billion. We expect to fulfill $8.8 billion of these obligations in 2023. These figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. Purchase obligations of $5.0 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. Purchase obligations of $12.7 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. 51ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KCapital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsMillions of Dollars202220212020Alaska1,091 982 1,038 Lower 485,630 3,129 1,881 Canada530 203 651 Europe, Middle East and North Africa998 534 600 Asia Pacific1,880 390 384 Other International— 33 121 Corporate and Other30 53 40 Capital Program*10,159 5,324 4,715 * Excludes capital related to acquisitions of businesses, net of capital acquired.Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, totaled $20.2 billion.

We accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 11 for information on contingencies. Legal and Tax MattersWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 17.EnvironmentalWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:•U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.•U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. In most cases, these regulations require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K54Capital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsThe ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the U.S. and Canada.An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, potential new laws, regulations and permitting requirements from various state environmental agencies, and others could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2022, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws.For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $705 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $669 million and $727 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $239 million in 2022 and are expected to be about $276 million and $314 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA, or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. 55ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KCapital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsRemediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.At December 31, 2022, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $182 million, compared with $187 million at December 31, 2021, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.See Item 1A—Risk Factors – We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations and Note 11 for information on environmental litigation.Climate ChangeContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:•European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2022 was approximately $22 million (net share before-tax).•U.K. Emissions Trading Scheme, the program with which the U.K. has replaced the ETS. Our cost of compliance with the U.K. ETS in 2022 was approximately $0.6 million (net share before-tax).•The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. We did not incur costs related to this regulation in 2022.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. •The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry.•The U.S. government has announced on September 17, 2021 the Global Methane Pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2022 were fees of approximately $36 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $6 million (net share before-tax).•The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, setting out a process for achieving global emissions reductions. The new administration has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced related commitments. Accordingly, the U.S. administration set a new target on April 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K56Capital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsIn the U.S., the Council on Environmental Quality's April 19, 2022 revised regulations and January 9, 2023 National Environmental Policy Act Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) require federal agencies to evaluate, among other things, the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of proposed projects subject to federal authorization, including a project's GHG emissions and potential climate change impact. The new NEPA regulations may result in longer agency review time or difficulty obtaining federal approval for development projects in our industry. Furthermore, additional regulations are forthcoming at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions, including EPA’s November 2022 supplemental proposal to strengthen methane emissions standards for new oil and gas facilities and establishing first-time presumptive standards for existing oil and gas facilities, as well as BLM’s November 2022 proposed regulations to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. Such regulations, when finalized, may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, royalty payments, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. •The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.•The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).•The GHG reductions required. •The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). •Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. See Item 1A—Risk Factors – Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products and Note 11 for information on climate change litigation.57ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KCapital Resources and LiquidityTable of ContentsCompany Response to Climate-Related RisksOur current Climate Risk Strategy and actions for our oil and gas operations are aligned with the aims of the Paris Agreement while being responsive to shareholder interests for long-term value and competitive returns and is also aligned with our Triple Mandate to responsibly meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambition.In 2020 we became the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate-risk strategy with an ambition to become a net-zero company for operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050. The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.In early 2022, we published our plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the 'Plan'), to outline how we intend to apply our strategic capabilities and resources to meet the challenges posed by climate change in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that balances the interests of our stakeholders.Key elements of our plan include:•Maintaining a resilient asset portfolio focused on resources with the low cost of supply and low greenhouse gas intensity needed to remain viable in any scenario.•Setting emissions-reduction targets over the near, medium and long terms for Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions, methane emissions intensity and flaring.•Expanding policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include demand-side policy and regulatory action such as direct federal regulation of methane, advocating for alternative transportation and power generation, and national policy recommendations on natural gas across the value chain.•Leveraging our assets and capabilities to develop low-carbon technologies and identify emerging business opportunities.•Tracking and responding to the transition through use of scenario planning to understand alternative pathways and test the resilience of our strategy.•Continuing capital discipline by incorporating scenario planning and a cost of carbon into our capital allocation decisions.Our Plan also recognizes the importance of reducing society’s end-use emissions to meet global climate goals. As an upstream producer, we do not control how the commodities we sell into global markets are converted into different energy products or selected for use by consumers. This is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy wide price on carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity energy use. We have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include regulatory action, such as support for the direct regulation of methane.In support of addressing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, in 2022, we made progress in several key areas. We continued to refine our Paris-aligned climate risk strategy, joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 Initiative and set a new near-zero 2030 methane emissions intensity target of approximately 0.15 percent of gas produced. Our emissions reduction efforts and net-zero ambition are supported by our multi-disciplinary Low-Carbon Technologies organization. See Item 1A—Risk Factors – Our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K58Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.Oil and Gas AccountingAccounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.Property Acquisition CostsFor individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.At year-end 2022, we held $6.5 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $4.7 billion is concentrated in the Delaware and Midland Basins, where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. Outside of the Delaware and Midland Basins, the remaining $1.8 billion is primarily concentrated in Canada and Alaska. Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.Exploratory CostsFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.At year-end 2022, total suspended well costs were $527 million, compared with $660 million at year-end 2021. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6.59ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KTable of ContentsProved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. See “Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations” for additional information. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2022, the net book value of productive PP&E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $55 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2022 was approximately $7.3 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2021 and 3.8 billion BOE at the end of 2022. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2022 would have increased by an estimated $808 million. Business Combination—Valuation of Oil and Gas PropertiesFor business combinations, management applies the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 – “Business Combinations” and allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimating the fair values involves making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. For significant business combinations, management generally utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engages third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates. Significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.The assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See Note 3.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K60Table of ContentsImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management’s assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 4.Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental CostsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. Estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. The carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 8.61ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KTable of ContentsProjected Benefit ObligationsThe actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $600 million. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 16.ContingenciesA number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and Note 11.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). See Note 17.We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. See Note 17.ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K62Table of ContentsCautionary Statement for the Purposes of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “effort,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “goal,” “guidance,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price RiskOur Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:•Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.•Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity contracts we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 65ConocoPhillips 2022 10-KTable of ContentsInterest Rate RiskThe following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date.

A hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our floating-rate debt. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, investments in equity securities and acquisitions.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward swap contracts. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring cash related balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2022 exchange rates.At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to buy $1.9 billion AUD at $0.715 AUD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2021, was a before-tax gain of $21 million. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2021 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $134 million. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,800 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2011 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. • Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). • Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our earnings depend largely on the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors affecting our profitability. In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced extreme volatility. As a result, in late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We have made significant progress on our three-year strategic plan through portfolio optimization, debt reduction and increased shareholder distributions. During 2011, we announced plans to sell an additional $5–$10 billion of noncore assets over the next two years, bringing the total asset divestiture program target to $15–$20 billion for the years 2010 through 2012. As of year-end 2011, we have generated approximately $10.7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward share repurchases and debt reduction. We also completed the sale of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011, which generated total proceeds of $9.5 billion in 2010 and 2011. These proceeds were largely used to fund share repurchases. In December 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. This increased the share repurchase program from $15 billion to $25 billion. Since the inception of the share repurchase programs, we have repurchased 15 percent of our shares outstanding for a total of $15 billion. During 2011, we also increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 20 percent, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.6 billion for the full year and reduced our debt by 4 percent. Our total capital program in 2012 is expected to be $15.5 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from $14.0 billion in 2011. We also expect 2012 production to be approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. Consistent with our strategy to focus on value creation for our shareholders, in July 2011, our Board approved pursuing the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment. We believe the separation will enable each company to pursue a more focused strategy, which will enable the management of each company to concentrate their resources on its particular market segments, customers and core businesses. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. Upon completion of the separation, ConocoPhillips will be a large and geographically diverse pure-play exploration and production company. Our strategy of enhancing returns on capital through developing new resources, growing reserves and production per share, continuing the asset sale program and increasing shareholder distributions will not change. Phillips 66 will be an integrated downstream company, with operations encompassing natural gas gathering and processing, crude oil refining, petroleum products marketing, transportation, power generation and petrochemicals manufacturing and marketing. We believe the execution of our strategic plan will position the two companies to be successful and competitive in the long term. Other important factors that we must continue to manage well in order to sustain our long-term competitive position include: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2011, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent, compared with 81 percent in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily resulted from the removal of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned maintenance. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 102 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and expropriations. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 1 percent in 2011, compared with 2010. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $13.3 billion in 2011, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.8 billion in 2012. The increase reflects our strategic emphasis on delivering value by investing in the most profitable opportunities. We expect competitive returns from increased investments in unconventional resource projects, such as our oil sands business in Canada, liquids-rich shale plays in the U.S. Lower 48 and the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture. As our production profile adjusts over time to reflect our increased levels of investment in liquids plays and lower levels in North American conventional natural gas, we expect higher returns in E&P, absent changes in market factors. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or otherwise disposed. As part of our $15–$20 billion asset divestiture program for 2010–2012, during 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated Flying J-branded truck and travel plazas; and several E&P properties located in the Lower 48 and western Canada. In 2011, we continued to divest low-return, noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada. We also sold WRG, Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our equity interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. East Coast refining has been under severe market pressure for several years. As a result, in September 2011, we announced our intention to sell the Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, Pennsylvania. The refinery has been idled and will permanently close by the end of the first quarter of 2012 if a sales transaction is unsuccessful. In addition, in E&P we recently entered into agreements to sell our Vietnam business, as well as certain North Sea assets. These sales are expected to close in the first half of 2012. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. In 2011, the global economic rate of growth slowed, leading to lower oil demand growth. Oil prices, however, increased in 2011, as supply concerns, including concerns over the loss of Libyan production, outweighed the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe. U.S. natural gas prices remained under pressure during 2011, as increased production from shale plays outpaced demand growth. As a result, storage inventory levels reached record highs by the end of 2011. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near- to mid-term. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; cancelation or delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities and certain natural gas pipelines. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $1.3 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Trainer Refinery, our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG) and certain Canadian natural gas properties. Before-tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4 billion and primarily related to the $1.5 billion property impairment of WRG and the $0.6 billion impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations, primarily in E&P, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Segment Analysis Earnings for the E&P segment are generally closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2011, compared with 2010, averaging $95.05 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 20 percent. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub decreased 8 percent during 2011 to an average price of $4.04 per million British thermal units. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 23 percent in 2011. Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins significantly improved during 2011, compared with 2010. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread, which is primarily WTI-based, increased 126 percent in 2011, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 20 percent. The improvement in domestic refining margins primarily resulted from increased production from shale plays and high inventory levels in the Midcontinent area, causing WTI to trade at a deeper discount relative to waterborne crudes for most of 2011. This discount, however, began to narrow toward the end of 2011. During the periods of large WTI-Brent spreads, refineries capable of processing WTI and crude oils that are WTI-based benefitted from the lower regional feedstock prices. In contrast, East Coast refining, which relies primarily on Brent-based crudes, has been under severe market pressure. Product imports, weakness in motor fuel demand, and costly regulatory requirements are key challenges in this difficult environment. The LUKOIL Investment segment consisted of our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 E&P $ 8,242 9,198 3,604 Midstream 458 306 313 R&M 3,751 192 37 LUKOIL Investment 239 2,503 1,219 Chemicals 745 498 248 Emerging Businesses (26 ) (59 ) 3 Corporate and Other (973 ) (1,280 ) (1,010 ) Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 12,436 11,358 4,414 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 9 percent in 2011. The improvement was mainly due to: • Higher commodity prices in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. • Improved results from our R&M operations, reflecting significantly higher U.S. refining margins. • Lower impairments. In 2011, impairments totaled $1,004 million after-tax, compared with 2010 impairments of $1,928 million after-tax. These items were partially offset by: • Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $1,637 million after-tax, compared with 2010 gains of $4,583 million after-tax. • The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. • Lower production volumes from our E&P segment. 2010 vs. 2009 The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of: • Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and LNG in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. • Gains of $4,583 million after-tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales. • Improved results from our domestic R&M operations, reflecting higher refining margins. These items were partially offset by: • Impairments totaling $1,928 million after-tax. • Lower production volumes from our E&P segment. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Statement Analysis 2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 29 percent in 2011, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. The increases were mainly due to significantly higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGLs. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 30 percent in 2011. The increase primarily resulted from: • Earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010. • Improved earnings from WRB Refining LP, primarily due to higher refining margins. • Improved earnings from CPChem, mainly due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. • Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment. • Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes. • Improved earnings from DCP Midstream, LLC, mainly as a result of higher NGL prices. These increases were partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. Gain on dispositions decreased 65 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, our interests in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the remaining divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent and the loss on disposition of WRG. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) decreased 12 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with our E&P segment, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011. Impairments decreased 56 percent in 2011, primarily due to the $1,514 million impairment of WRG in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by the impairment of the Trainer Refinery and various North American E&P natural gas properties in 2011. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes increased 9 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower debt levels. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Sales and other operating revenues increased 27 percent in 2010, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 24 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from: • Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. • Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes. • Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes. These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. Gain on dispositions increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $2,878 million gain realized from the Syncrude sale, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. Impairments increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the 2010 WRG impairment. Taxes other than income taxes increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt levels.

The E&P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. Total E&P production averaged 1,619,000 BOED in 2011, compared with 1,752,000 BOED in 2010. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from our E&P segment were $8,242 million in 2011, a 10 percent decrease compared with earnings of $9,198 million in 2010. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings were $3,254 million in 2011, an 18 percent increase compared with earnings of $2,768 million in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from higher crude oil and NGL prices, and, to a lesser extent, lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by higher production taxes, mainly in Alaska, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses and lower gains from asset sales in the Lower 48. U.S. E&P production averaged 653,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 5 percent from 686,000 BOED in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and asset dispositions, which was partially offset by new production, mostly from the Lower 48. International E&P International E&P earnings were $4,988 million in 2011, a 22 percent decrease compared with earnings of $6,430 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 included $316 million in additional income tax expense, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in July 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. In 2011, earnings also included impairments of our investment in NMNG and various natural gas properties located in Canada, in addition to a $279 million loss on the dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Earnings in 2010 included gains from the sale of Syncrude and certain Canadian properties and an impairment of NMNG. Excluding the impact from these items, earnings increased in 2011, primarily due to higher prices, a full year of LNG sales from QG3 and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partially offset by lower volumes and higher taxes. International E&P production averaged 966,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 9 percent from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. The decrease primarily resulted from suspended operations in Libya and in Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from our E&P segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3,604 million in 2009. U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an unfavorable tax ruling. U.S. E&P production averaged 686,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000 BOED in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International E&P International E&P earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after-tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi. International E&P production averaged 1,066,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 3 percent from 1,099,000 BOED in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGLs from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or refinery blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 50 percent in 2011, reflecting higher equity earnings from DCP Midstream and improved results from our other Midstream operations. Both DCP Midstream and our equity affiliate in Trinidad benefited from significantly higher NGL prices, which generally tracked the improved crude oil price environment in 2011. Also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for NGL fractionation services, reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts. These items were partially offset by higher costs at DCP Midstream, primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased DD&A. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate in Trinidad, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009 recognition of an $88 million after-tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease in earnings.

R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 2011 vs. 2010 R&M reported earnings of $3,751 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $192 million in 2010. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on industry refining margins. U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $3,595 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $1,022 million in 2010. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset sales of $1,577 million after-tax mainly resulted from the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company and our equity investments in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, while 2010 included the $113 million after-tax gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. These increases were partially offset by the $303 million after-tax impairment and warehouse inventory write-down associated with our Trainer Refinery in 2011. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2011, compared with 90 percent in 2010. The increase mainly resulted from lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime. International R&M International R&M reported earnings of $156 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $830 million in 2010. The increase in earnings was mostly due to the absence of the 2010 WRG impairment, in addition to higher refining volumes and foreign currency gains in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower refining margins and the $86 million after-tax loss on sale of WRG and related warehouse inventory write-downs in 2011. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2011, compared with 56 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from the removal of WRG from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity. 2010 vs. 2009 R&M reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $37 million in 2009. U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was largely due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime. International R&M International R&M reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 mainly resulted from the WRG impairment and a $29 million after-tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign currency losses. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74 percent in 2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflected run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LUKOIL Investment $00,0000 $00,0000 $00,0000 Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 239 2,503 1,219 Operating Statistics Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) - 284 388 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) - 254 295 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) - 189 240 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment. 2010 vs. 2009 LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,284 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after-tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold during 2010.

CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased 50 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher margins, volumes and equity earnings in the olefins and polyolefins business line. The specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. Higher operating costs partially offset these increases. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Emerging Businesses $00,0000 $00,0000 $00,0000 Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 115 49 105 Other (141 ) (108 ) (102 ) $ (26 ) (59 ) 3 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2011 vs. 2010 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $26 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $59 million in 2010. The increase in “Power” earnings was primarily due to the absence of 2010 impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant, which was sold in December 2010, combined with higher international power generation results. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in “Other” losses in 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3 million in 2009. The decrease in “Power” earnings was mainly due to higher operating costs and lower margins in international power generation, in addition to the impairment charges and loss on sale of the U.S. cogeneration plant. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in “Other” losses in 2010.

Net interest decreased 31 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, which resulted from lower debt levels; the absence of a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement, which occurred in 2010; and slightly higher interest income. Separation costs consist of expenses incurred for the planned separation of our downstream businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Expenses incurred in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the “Other” category primarily resulted from foreign currency transaction gains and lower environmental costs, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment. 2010 vs. 2009 Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to the $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $101 million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Changes in the “Other” category primarily reflected foreign currency transaction losses. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,646 17,045 12,479 Short-term debt 1,013 936 1,728 Total debt 22,623 23,592 28,653 Total equity 65,734 69,109 62,613 Percent of total debt to capital* 26 % 25 31 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 10 % 10 9 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. **Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2011, we received $4,820 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, the primary uses of our available cash were $13,266 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $11,123 million to repurchase common stock; $3,632 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $961 million to repay debt. During 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,674 million to $5,780 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2011, cash of $19,646 million was provided by operating activities, a 15 percent increase from cash from operations of $17,045 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices in our E&P segment and higher U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment. During 2010, cash flow from operations increased $4,566 million, compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our E&P segment and higher refining margins in our R&M segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil prices increased in 2009, 2010 and 2011, although natural gas prices remained weak. Global refining margins were under pressure during 2009 and 2010. Domestic refining margins significantly improved during the first three quarters of 2011, followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our E&P production for 2011 averaged 1.62 million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2012, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.6 million BOED. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2012 and future years’ production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2011 was 112 percent, including 117 percent from consolidated operations. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the reserve replacement was 120 percent of 2011 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 30 percent (including 64 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL, the expropriation of our assets in Venezuela and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and acquisitions, our five-year reserve replacement was 102 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In our R&M segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2011 were $4.8 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in 2010. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included $2.0 billion from the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and $1.2 billion from the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. Other asset sales primarily included mature North American natural gas assets and a products pipeline. We plan to raise an additional $5 billion to $10 billion from asset sales in 2012. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. The terms of the new revolving credit facility are similar to the terms of the replaced facility. We also have a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,128 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investors Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2011, QG3 had approximately $3.9 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including $1.2 billion owed to ConocoPhillips. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2011, was $22.6 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion during 2011, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 26 percent at year-end 2011, versus 25 percent at the end of 2010. The slight increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a decrease in total equity resulting from the share repurchase programs in 2011, partially offset by the debt reduction. Our debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $732 million was short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. During 2011, WRB Refining LP repaid $550 million of loan financing to ConocoPhillips that had been provided to assist WRB in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. No outstanding balance remained at December 31, 2011. In February 2012, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 21, 2012. On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the first quarter of 2011. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under both programs, repurchases totaled 220 million shares at a cost of $15 billion through December 31, 2011. On December 2, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2011: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years 2-3 Years 4-5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 22,592 1,005 2,799 3,933 14,855 Capital lease obligations 31 8 3 2 18 Total debt 22,623 1,013 2,802 3,935 14,873 Interest on debt and other obligations 19,798 1,319 2,567 2,227 13,685 Operating lease obligations 2,761 767 901 502 591 Purchase obligations (b) 145,114 60,105 13,142 8,101 63,766 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 4,314 732 1,586 1,762 234 Other long-term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,920 387 668 505 7,360 Accrued environmental costs 922 126 147 97 552 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 153 153 (e) (e ) (e ) Total $ 204,605 64,602 21,813 17,129 101,061 (a) Includes $449 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $71,737 million. In addition, $50,741 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas liquids over the remaining term of 88 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 14 years. Purchase obligations of $17,044 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a six-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions—for the 2012 through 2016 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $490 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $690 million for 2012 and then approximately $445 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2012 is expected to be $530 million in the United States and $220 million outside the United States. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $918 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2012 is $14.8 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $0.4 billion in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 90 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 8 percent to R&M. With the addition of principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2012 is approximately $15.5 billion. E&P Capital expenditures and investments for E&P during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, totaled $29.4 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: • Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. • Advancement of coalbed methane (CBM) projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Western North Slope and the Cook Inlet Area. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Development drilling and facilities projects in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, including the Greater Ekofisk Area, Alvheim and Statfjord, and Heidrun in the Norwegian Sea. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay. • The Kashagan Field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea offshore Kazakhstan. • In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, the development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area, the development of Clair Ridge, development drilling on Clair and in the southern and central North Sea. • The North Belut Field, as well as other projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • The QG3 Project, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. • The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. • Exploration activities in Australia’s Browse Basin, North American shale plays, Canadian oil sands projects, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. • The El Merk Project, comprised of wells, gathering lines and a shared central processing facility to develop the EMK Field Unit in Algeria. 2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget is $13.3 billion, 11 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2011. Forty-three percent of E&P’s 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to be directed toward the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields, as well as the Alpine Field and satellites on the Western North Slope. In the Lower 48, we expect to focus capital expenditures and investments on development of liquids-rich areas, such as the Eagle Ford Trend, and the Williston and Permian basins. We also expect to direct capital spending towards exploration and appraisal activities in the Eagle Ford shale formation, as well as recently acquired acreage in the Avalon, Wolfcamp, and Niobrara areas. In addition, we plan to appraise our recent deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries. E&P is directing $7.6 billion of its 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2012 are expected to be directed to developing major long-term projects including: • Liquids opportunities in the western Canada basins and Canadian oil sands projects. • Further development of CBM projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region, continued development of Bohai Bay in China, new fields offshore Malaysia, and offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • In the North Sea, the Greater Ekofisk Area, development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area, development of Clair Ridge and the Britannia Long-Term Compression Project. • The Kashagan Field in the Caspian Sea. • Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya. • Exploration and appraisal activities in Canadian shale plays and oil sands projects, Australia’s offshore Browse Basin and onshore Canning Basin, deepwater Angola, Kazakhstan’s Block N, offshore Indonesia, Nigeria and the North Sea. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $3.8 billion, which represented 11 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Installation of a 20,000-barrel-per-day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. • Installation of a 225-ton-per-day sulfur plant at the Sweeny Refinery. • Installation of facilities to reduce emissions from the Fluid Catalytic Crackers at the Alliance and Sweeny refineries. • Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new vacuum furnace at the Bayway Refinery. • Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance and Ponca City refineries. Major construction activities in progress include: • Installation, revamp and expansion of equipment at the Bayway Refinery to enable production of low benzene gasoline. • U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 21 percent increase from actual spending in 2011, with about $1.0 billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, efficiency and reliability. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for an expansion and other capital improvements at the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. Another example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2010, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 73 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2011, we had been notified of 8 new sites, settled 5 sites and closed 2 sites, bringing the number to 74 unresolved sites with potential liability. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,039 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $1,100 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Capitalized environmental costs were $573 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $875 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2011, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $922 million, compared with $994 million at December 31, 2010. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. • Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. • Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which is scheduled to take effect July 2012. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2011, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,880 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $487 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 47 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2012 would increase by approximately $22 million. The remaining $5,966 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2011 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $97 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2012. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2011, total suspended well costs were $1,037 million, compared with $1,013 million at year-end 2010. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2011, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $57 billion and the DD&A 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recorded on these assets in 2011 was approximately $6.6 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010 and 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2011 would have increased by an estimated $347 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving PP&E and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2011, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. At December 31, 2011, we had $3,332 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OUTLOOK Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses On July 14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips’ shareholders on the record date for the share distribution. In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the SEC on November 14, 2011, and an amendment on January 3, 2012. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. As part of the separation, we expect to receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66. These funds will primarily be used to repay debt, with the balance directed to share repurchases and dividends. In conjunction with the separation, we expect to incur one-time legal, information technology, audit, advisor, and deferred and cash tax costs, resulting in an estimated pre-separation earnings impact of approximately $150 million after-tax, of which $25 million was incurred in 2011. China—Bohai Bay On July 13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the People’s Republic of China instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September 2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai 19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately 2,600 barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative measure to capture any residue. The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to China’s National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012. The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by 14,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time. In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with China’s Ministry of Agriculture to resolve fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or cyber attacks. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan. • Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components. • The effect of the separation of our downstream businesses. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The senior vice president of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks related to our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demands. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to floating market prices. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year-end 2011 and 2010 effective yield rates of 1.24 percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. These adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2011, or 2010, exchange rates.

Due to the separation of the downstream businesses and our intention to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses in 2012, which are reported as discontinued operations, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips as an independent exploration and production company. The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 30 countries. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 16,900 employees worldwide and total assets of $117 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Discontinued Operations On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our “Downstream business”), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our strategic asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview As an independent E&P company, we are solely focused on our core business of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our portfolio primarily includes legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; growing North American shale and oil sands businesses; several major international developments; and a global exploration program. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver 32 Table of Contents production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve our value proposition through portfolio optimization, investments in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility. In our first year as an independent E&P company, we achieved production of 1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), including production from discontinued operations of .05 million BOED; advanced our growth and drilling programs; paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion for the full year; and repurchased 80 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $5.1 billion. In 2012, we also announced plans to raise $8–$10 billion of proceeds from asset dispositions by the end of 2013. As part of this program, we have generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions through December 31, 2012. We have also announced asset sales, expected to close by mid-2013, which will generate approximately $9.6 billion in additional proceeds. In the near-term, we will fund a portion of our capital program with these proceeds. Over the next five years, our investment in high-margin developments should position us to deliver 3–5 percent annual production volume and margin growth, enabling us to fund our capital program organically. Our total capital program is expected to be $15.8 billion in 2013, compared to $15.7 billion in 2012. Excluding Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, which are reported as discontinued operations, our 2013 capital program is expected to be $15.5 billion, compared to $14.9 billion in 2012. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will build our inventory for the future. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2012 included the following: • Completed the separation of our Downstream business on April 30, 2012, creating two independent energy companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. • Achieved annual production of 1.58 million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of .05 million BOED, and generated earnings of $7.5 billion. • Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 156 percent and year-end proved reserves of 8.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. • Repurchased 80 million ConocoPhillips shares, representing 6 percent of our outstanding shares. • Paid quarterly dividends of 66 cents per share, consistent with pre-separation dividends. • Exceeded 100,000 BOED production milestone in the Eagle Ford; continued Bakken activity ramp up. • Exceeded 100,000 BOED average production in the Canadian Oil sands in the fourth quarter of 2012. • Progressed FCCL expansion with sanction of Christina Lake Phase F and Narrows Lake Phase A. • Achieved first oil from the Gumusut Field in Malaysia. • Increased deepwater Gulf of Mexico position to 1.7 million acres; continued appraisal drilling. Expect to increase acreage position to 2.0 million acres in the first quarter of 2013. • Increased Niobrara acreage position to approximately 130,000 acres; continued drilling and testing of unconventional shale plays. • Progressed the Australia Pacific LNG Project with sanction of the second train in early July 2012; secured $8.5 billion project finance facility. • Advanced the disposition program with the announcement of agreements to sell Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria, generating approximately $8.5 billion in expected proceeds. Business Environment In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the recent financial crisis, geopolitical events or fears thereof, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, and weather-related disruptions. These factors generally influence the supply and demand of crude oil and natural gas. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our 33 Table of Contents operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices. The prices for commodity products are supply- and demand-based and can be very volatile; therefore, to navigate through the volatility, our strategy is to maintain a core portfolio of low-risk, high-return development programs associated with legacy assets, coupled with a portfolio of development opportunities which offer high-margin growth, such as unconventional plays, deepwater and arctic drilling, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: • Operating safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2012, our organic reserve replacement was 108 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on higher-margin liquids plays and limited investment in North American conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. 34 Table of Contents Our $15.8 billion capital program includes contributions to FCCL of $0.8 billion. Our capital expenditures and investment budget for 2013, excluding FCCL, is $15.0 billion, compared to actual capital expenditures and investments in 2012 of $15.0 billion. Excluding discontinued operations for Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, we estimate 2013 capital expenditures and investments will be $14.7 billion, compared to $14.2 billion in 2012. Approximately 10 percent of the 2013 capital budget is expected to be directed toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio; 40 percent is expected to be allocated to exploitation programs in our legacy asset base, which is intended to offset natural decline from these assets; 35 percent is expected to be spent on sanctioned major developments, such as Eldfisk II, Jasmine and APLNG; and 15 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays. • Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell an additional $8–$10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2012, we sold our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and we further diluted our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, our Algerian and Nigerian businesses, and certain properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana. Cedar Creek Anticline is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, and the remaining transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. Additionally, in January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. In 2011, we sold certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada, and we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 8 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily as a result of major turnaround expenses in Australia, higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with improved production as a result of increased drilling programs, the settlement of environmental claims and other costs related to Bohai Bay, China, and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. 35 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2012 2011 2010 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 94.16 95.05 79.39 Dated Brent (per barrel) 111.58 111.27 79.47 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 2.79 4.04 4.39 Global oil prices remained relatively flat in 2012, compared to 2011. In 2012, global oil demand grew at approximately the same pace as in 2011, at about 0.9 percent or 800 thousand barrels per day, as the pace of economic expansion moderated due to intentional slowing in China, coupled with fiscal uncertainties in the European Union and the United States. Global oil production rose due to an increase in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and North American production. WTI continued to trade at a discount to Brent throughout 2011 and 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels and excess crude supply in the U.S. Midcontinent market, largely as a result of limited pipeline capacity. Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased 31 percent in 2012, compared with 2011. U.S. natural gas prices were depressed in 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels, a warmer-than-normal winter and sustained production from shale plays. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices in the near- to mid-term. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 30 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Our realized bitumen price declined 14 percent in 2012. We expect bitumen prices to remain weak in the near-term, until additional heavy refining capacity comes on-line. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; continued delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of our equity 36 Table of Contents investment in NMNG and certain Canadian natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Outlook Total production for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be 1.58 million to 1.6 million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of approximately 40,000 BOED. Full-year 2013 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1.475 million to 1.525 million BOED,which is consistent with 2012 production from continuing operations adjusted for dispositions. Segment Analysis We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Alaska $ 2,276 1,984 1,727 Lower 48 and Latin America 1,029 1,288 1,029 Canada (684 ) 91 2,902 Europe 1,498 1,830 1,703 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,996 3,093 2,153 Other International 359 (377 ) (417) LUKOIL Investment - 239 2,513 Corporate and Other (993 ) (960 ) (1,305) Income from continuing operations $ 7,481 7,188 10,305 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 4 percent in 2012. The increase was mainly due to: • Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax. • Higher LNG and crude oil prices. • Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes. • The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million. • The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax. These items were partially offset by: • Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China. • Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices. • Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax. • Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 30 percent in 2011. The decrease was mainly due to: • Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $141 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2010 of $4,463 million after-tax. • The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. • Lower production volumes. 38 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: • Higher commodity prices. Commodity price benefits were partly offset by increased production taxes. • Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly as a result of lower volumes. Income Statement Analysis 2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from: • Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes. • Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment. Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea and our interest in Block 39 in Peru, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. For additional information, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes. Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48. SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project as a result of its indefinite suspension in the first quarter of 2012. Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the $213 million impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project in the first quarter of 2012, the $192 million property impairment related to the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, as well as increases in the asset retirement obligation for various properties mostly located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes. Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 14 percent in 2011, mainly due to significantly higher prices for crude oil and higher LNG prices and volumes. Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes partly offset this increase. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 10 percent in 2011. The decrease primarily resulted from the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. This decrease was partially offset by: • Earnings from QG3, primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010. • Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment. • Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 93 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, as well as the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of a portion of our LUKOIL shares, and gains on the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada. Purchased commodities increased 20 percent in 2011, mainly due to higher natural gas prices in Europe. DD&A decreased 15 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011. Impairments increased $240 million in 2011, mostly due to the impairment of various North American natural gas properties in 2011. Taxes other than income taxes increased 43 percent in 2011, mostly due to higher production taxes in Alaska as a result of higher crude oil prices. Interest and debt expense decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 40 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2012 2011 2010 Average Net Production(1) Crude oil (MBD)(2) 595 622 733 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 156 145 147 Synthetic oil (MBD) - - 12 Bitumen (MBD) 93 67 59 Natural gas (MMCFD)(3) 4,096 4,359 4,465 Total Production (MBOED)(4) 1,527 1,561 1,695 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 105.72 105.52 77.74 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 46.36 55.73 46.00 Synthetic oil (per barrel) - - 77.56 Bitumen (per barrel) 53.91 62.56 53.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 5.48 5.80 5.05 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 626 569 649 Leasehold impairment 719 159 241 Dry holes 155 310 235 $ 1,500 1,038 1,125 Excludes discontinued operations.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2012, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48. In 2011, average production decreased 8 percent compared with 2010, mostly as a result of suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and higher unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production. 41 Table of Contents Alaska 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,276 1,984 1,727 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 188 200 215 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 16 15 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) 55 61 82 Total Production (MBOED) 213 225 244 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 109.62 105.95 78.65 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.22 4.56 4.62 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2012, Alaska contributed 24 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Our Alaska operations reported earnings of $2,276 million in 2012, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,984 million in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses. Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime. 2011 vs. 2010 Alaska earnings were $1,984 million in 2011, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,727 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 benefitted from significantly higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production taxes, lower volumes, higher operating expenses, and the $54 million after-tax write-off of the Denali gas pipeline project. Production averaged 225 MBOED in 2011, a decrease of 8 percent compared with 2010. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, somewhat offset by increased drilling activity. 42 Table of Contents Lower 48 and Latin America 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 1,029 1,288 1,029 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 123 94 85 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 85 74 75 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,493 1,556 1,695 Total Production (MBOED) 457 428 442 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 91.67 92.79 73.52 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 35.45 50.55 39.92 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.67 3.99 4.25 During 2012, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 37 percent of our natural gas production. The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states. 2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America operations reported earnings of $1,029 million in 2012, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which has been reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production. 2011 vs. 2010 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings were $1,288 million in 2011, a 25 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase in 2011 earnings was mainly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, lower natural gas prices, higher dry hole expenses and impairments. Production averaged 428 MBOED in 2011, a 3 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 was mainly due to asset dispositions. Normal field decline was offset by new production, mainly from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and Barnett areas, and improved drilling and well performance. 43 Table of Contents Canada 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (684 ) 91 2,902 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 13 12 15 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 24 26 23 Synthetic oil (MBD) - - 12 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 12 10 10 Equity affiliates 81 57 49 Total bitumen 93 67 59 Natural gas (MMCFD) 857 928 984 Total Production (MBOED) 273 260 273 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 78.26 86.04 67.99 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 48.64 56.84 47.68 Synthetic oil (per barrel) - - 77.56 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 57.58 55.16 51.10 Equity affiliates 53.39 63.93 53.43 Total bitumen 53.91 62.56 53.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.13 3.46 3.74 Our Canadian operations are mainly comprised of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2012, Canada contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments. Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes. Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek, both in FCCL. 2011 vs. 2010 Canada earnings were $91 million in 2011, a reduction of $2,811 million compared with 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower gains from asset dispositions. Earnings in 2010 included the $2,679 million after-tax gain realized from the sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation. Lower volumes, mostly as a result of asset dispositions, impairments on various natural gas properties and lower 44 Table of Contents natural gas prices also contributed to the decrease in 2011 earnings. These decreases were somewhat offset by higher bitumen, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, lower DD&A and lower dry hole expenses. Production averaged 260 MBOED in 2011, a 5 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease was mainly due to asset dispositions and normal field decline, partly offset by new production from FCCL.

In 2012, our Europe operations contributed 17 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 13 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Europe operations reported earnings of $1,498 million in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The reduction in earnings was mainly due to lower volumes and higher impairments. Earnings for 2012 were also impacted by additional income tax expense due to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in 2012, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by a $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. Production averaged 228 MBOED in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease was mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for our Europe operations were $1,830 million in 2011, a 7 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,703 million in 2010. Earnings benefitted from significantly higher prices and lower DD&A, partly offset by lower volumes and the $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from a $58 million insurance settlement. 45 Table of Contents Production averaged 279 MBOED in 2011, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease mainly resulted from normal field decline, unplanned downtime and dispositions, somewhat offset by new production from Britannia and J-Block.

During 2012, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 28 percent of our natural gas production. 2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East operations reported earnings of $3,996 million in 2012, a 29 percent increase compared with 2011 earnings of $3,093 million. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 46 Table of Contents 2012 consisted of a $931 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business and a $133 million after-tax loss recognized on the further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. In 2011, we recognized a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes. Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China. 2011 vs. 2010 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 44 percent in 2011, compared with 2010 earnings. The increase was mainly due to higher prices, higher volumes, mostly as a result of a full year of LNG sales from QG3, and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partly offset by higher production taxes, higher operating expenses and the $279 million loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Production averaged 332 MBOED in 2011, a 14 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase was largely due to the ramp-up of production from QG3, partly offset by higher unplanned downtime, mainly in China, and normal field decline. Timor-Leste Arbitration ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. Between 2010 and 2012, ConocoPhillips has paid, under protest, tax assessments totaling approximately $227 million, which are primarily recorded in the “Investments and long-term receivables” line on our December 31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The arbitration will be conducted in Singapore under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste Government. The arbitration process is currently underway. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time. 47 Table of Contents Other International 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars)* $ 359 (377 ) (417) Average Net Production* Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 40 8 46 Equity affiliates 13 29 52 Total crude oil 53 37 98 Natural gas (MMCFD) 18 1 8 Total Production (MBOED) 56 37 99 Average Sales Prices* Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 110.75 98.30 79.22 Equity affiliates 96.50 101.62 74.33 Total crude oil 107.56 101.14 76.57 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 5.55 0.09 0.09 * Prior periods have been restated to exclude discontinued operations. The Other International segment includes producing operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Angola and the Caspian Sea. During 2012, Other International contributed 6 percent of our worldwide liquids production. 2012 vs. 2011 Other International operations reported earnings of $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Production averaged 56 MBOED in 2012, a 51 percent increase compared with 2011 production. The increase was mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG. 2011 vs. 2010 Other International reported a loss of $377 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $417 million in 2010. The improvement in 2011 was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A from NMNG and lower impairments. In 2011, we recorded a $395 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG, compared with a $645 million impairment to NMNG recorded in 2010. These improvements in 2011 were partly offset by considerably lower volumes, mainly from Libya and Russia, as well as the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in 2010. Production averaged 37 MBOED in 2011, a 63 percent decrease compared with 2010 production. The decrease was mostly due to suspended operations in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and field decline in Russia. 48 Table of Contents Asset Dispositions We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan and our Algerian and Nigerian businesses. The transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. In January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations $ - 239 2,513 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (648 ) (710 ) (995) Corporate general and administrative expenses (313 ) (190 ) (209) Technology (4 ) 15 (23) Separation costs (84 ) (25 ) - Other 56 (50 ) (78) $ (993 ) (960 ) (1,305) 2012 vs. 2011 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology. Technology reported a loss of $4 million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues. 49 Table of Contents Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The improvement in “Other” in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39 million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses. 2011 vs. 2010 Net interest decreased 29 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, as a result of lower average debt levels. In addition, the absence of a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and the absence of $24 million of after-tax interest expense associated with a tax settlement, both of which occurred in 2010, contributed to the decrease. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2011, mainly due to lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans, partly offset by higher advertising expenses. Technology had earnings of $15 million in 2011, as a result of higher licensing revenues, partially offset by higher project expenses. Separation costs in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs. Changes in the “Other” category primarily resulted from lower environmental costs and gains from foreign currency transactions, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment. 50 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 13,458 13,953 14,013 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 464 5,693 3,032 Short-term debt 955 1,013 936 Total debt 21,725 22,623 23,592 Total equity 48,427 65,749 69,124 Percent of total debt to capital* 31 % 26 25 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 9 % 10 10 * Capital includes total debt and total equity. ** Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2012, we received $2,132 million in proceeds from asset sales and $1,996 million for the issuance of debt. During 2012, the primary uses of our available cash were $14,172 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $5,098 million to repurchase common stock; $3,278 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $2,565 million to repay debt. During 2012, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,162 million to $3,618 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Separation of Phillips 66 On April 30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, were transferred to Phillips 66. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April 30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April 16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date. In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution. These funds will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At December 31, 2012, the unused amount of the special cash distribution was $748 million and is designated as “Restricted cash” on our consolidated balance sheet. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2012, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $13,458 million, a 4 percent decrease from 2011. During 2011, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,953 million compared with $14,013 million in 2010. 51 Table of Contents While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our 2012 production from continuing operations averaged 1.527 million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2013 is expected to be 1.475 million to 1.525 million BOED. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2012 was 142 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 156 percent of 2012 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2012, our reserve replacement was 48 percent (including 65 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 108 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. We are pursuing developments we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make development uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2012 were $2,132 million, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea. This compares with proceeds of $2,192 million in 2011, which mainly included the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL and certain properties located in the Lower 48. We have announced additional asset sales of $9.6 billion which are expected to close by mid-2013. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In May 2012, we decreased our total revolving credit facilities from $8.0 billion to $7.5 billion by terminating all commitments under the $500 million credit facility, which was due to expire in July 2012. At 52 Table of Contents December 31, 2012, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, with no letters of credit issued at December 31, 2012, and $40 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, $1,055 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2012, compared with $1,128 million at December 31, 2011. Since we had $1,055 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.4 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2012. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investors Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral. Cash is the primary source for providing collateral; however, many permit us to post letters of credit. At December 31, 2012, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $852 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 53 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2012, was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $0.9 billion during 2012. During 2012, we repaid notes totaling $2.4 billion. We incurred a before-tax loss on redemption of $79 million, consisting of make-whole premiums and unamortized issuance costs. In December 2012, we issued $2.0 billion of new low-interest notes. We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to FCCL. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007 and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $772 million was short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $733 million in 2012, is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. In February, 2013, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 1, 2013, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2013. Since our share repurchase programs began in 2010, share repurchases totaled 300 million shares at a cost of $20.1 billion through December 31, 2012. Although we have no current plans for further share repurchases, we may do so opportunistically, contingent upon commodity prices and proceeds from asset dispositions. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2012: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years 2-3 Years 4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,709 955 1,952 3,274 15,528 Capital lease obligations 16 - - - 16 Total debt 21,725 955 1,952 3,274 15,544 Interest on debt and other obligations 16,355 1,247 2,216 1,964 10,928 Operating lease obligations 2,151 477 960 424 290 Purchase obligations (b) 26,465 12,149 4,370 2,242 7,704 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 3,582 772 1,672 1,138 - Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (d) 2,579 484 1,045 1,050 - Asset retirement obligations* 9,033 387 521 413 7,712 Accrued environmental costs 364 38 65 48 213 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 116 116 (e ) (e ) (e) Total $ 82,370 16,625 12,801 10,553 42,391 *Excludes amounts related to discontinued operations: $ 131 - - - 131 (a) Includes $429 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $12,602 million. Purchase obligations of $9,629 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a five-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2013 through 2017. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2017, see Note 19—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $756 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. 55 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Program Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Alaska $ 828 774 729 Lower 48 and Latin America 5,251 3,882 1,790 Canada 2,184 1,761 1,356 Europe 2,860 2,222 1,190 Asia Pacific and Middle East 2,430 2,325 2,157 Other International 415 8 127 LUKOIL Investment - - - Corporate and Other 204 242 186 Capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations 14,172 11,214 7,535 Discontinued operations in Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria 817 1,038 1,071 Joint venture acquisition obligation (principal)—Canada 733 695 659 Capital Program $ 15,722 12,947 9,265 Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, totaled $32.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. • Further development of coalbed methane (CBM) associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Oil sands and ongoing natural gas developments in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Western North Slope and the Cook Inlet Area and initial development of the Point Thomson Unit. • Development drilling and new facilities in the Norway sector of the North Sea, including the Greater Ekofisk Area, Alvheim, Visund and Statfjord, and Heidrun in the Norwegian Sea. • The Bohai Bay development in China. • In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, the development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Area, the development of Clair Ridge and development drilling in the southern and central North Sea. • The North Belut Field, as well as other developments in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • QG3, an integrated development which produces and liquefies natural gas from Qatar’s North Field. • The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. • Exploration activities in Australia’s Browse Basin, North American shale plays, Canadian oil sands developments, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the U.K. and Norway sectors of the North Sea, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. • Leasehold acquisitions in Angola. 56 Table of Contents 2013 CAPITAL PROGRAM Our 2013 capital program of $15.8 billion is comprised of $15.0 billion for the capital expenditures and investments budget and $0.8 billion for principal contributions to fund our portion of the FCCL business venture. Of the $15.0 billion for the capital expenditures and investments budget, $0.3 billion relates to our discontinued operations in Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria and $14.7 billion relates to continuing operations. Included in the 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget is $0.6 billion in capitalized interest. Our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations of $14.7 billion is 4 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2012. We are directing approximately 60 percent of our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations to North America. These funds are expected to be directed toward: • In Alaska, further development of opportunities in Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Alpine fields, and initial development of Point Thomson Field. • In Lower 48, development of liquids-rich areas, such as the Eagle Ford trend, and the Williston and Permian basins. • Exploration and appraisal activities in the Eagle Ford shale formation, and Avalon, Wolfcamp and Niobrara areas in Lower 48. • Appraisal of deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries, wildcat wells and acreage additions. • Liquids opportunities in the western Canada basins and Canadian oil sands. • Exploration and appraisal activities in Canadian shale plays and oil sands. We are directing approximately 40 percent of our 2013 capital expenditures and investments budget for continuing operations to Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. These funds are expected to be directed toward: • Further development of CBM associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, continued development of Bohai Bay in China, new fields offshore Malaysia, and offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • In the North Sea, the Greater Ekofisk Area, development of the Jasmine discovery in the J-Block Area, development of Clair Ridge and the Britannia Long Term Compression Project. • Onshore developments in Libya. • Exploration and appraisal activities in Australia’s offshore Browse Basin and onshore Canning Basin, deepwater Angola, offshore Indonesia and Malaysia, and the North Sea. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. 57 Table of Contents Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. 58 Table of Contents These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2011, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 74 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2012, we had closed 2 sites and transferred 61 sites to Phillips 66, bringing the number to 11 unresolved sites with potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state 59 Table of Contents agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $575 million in 2012 and are expected to be about $478 million per year in 2013 and 2014. Capitalized environmental costs were $297 million in 2012 and are expected to be about $459 million per year in 2013 and 2014. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2012, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $364 million, and we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. At December 31, 2011, accrued environmental costs were $922 million, of which $542 million related to the Downstream business. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2012 was approximately $10 million (pre-tax equity share). • A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2012 was approximately $7 million. 60 Table of Contents • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2012 was approximately $20 million (equity share pre-tax). In October 2012 the Norwegian government announced a doubling of the carbon tax for oil and gas production in 2013. Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which took effect from July 2012. Our annual cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation during the initial fixed price phase is approximately $10 million (equity share pre-tax). In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. 61 Table of Contents The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2011 the Company reduced GHG emissions by 600,000 tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The Company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $8 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 62 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2012, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,915 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $517 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 46 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2013 would increase by approximately $30 million. At year-end 2012, the remaining $6,576 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. These major assets are not expected to move to proved properties in 2013. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 63 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2012, total suspended well costs were $1,038 million, compared with $1,037 million at year-end 2011. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 64 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2012, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $55 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2012 was approximately $6.4 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2012 would have increased by an estimated $336 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other 65 Table of Contents compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. 66 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen and LNG. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or cyber attacks. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG or natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan. • Inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. 67 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: — Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. — Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2012, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year-end 2012 and 2011 effective yield rates of 0.7 percent and 1.24 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. 68 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Joint VentureAcquisition Obligation Expected Maturity Date FixedRateMaturity AverageInterestRate FloatingRateMaturity AverageInterestRate FixedRateMaturity AverageInterestRate Year-End 2012 2013 $ 850 5.75 % $ 91 0.25 % $ 772 5.30 % 2014 400 4.75 - - 814 5.30 2015 1,500 4.60 - - 858 5.30 2016 1,273 5.52 964 0.25 904 5.30 2017 1,001 1.06 - - 234 5.30 Remaining years 14,918 6.25 283 0.19 - 5.30 Total $ 19,942 $ 1,338 $ 3,582 Fair value $ 25,011 $ 1,338 $ 3,968 Year-End 2011 2012 $ 918 4.80 % $ 3 0.38 % $ 732 5.30 % 2013 1,262 5.33 - - 772 5.30 2014 1,511 4.77 - - 814 5.30 2015 1,513 4.62 15 2.01 858 5.30 2016 1,287 5.54 1,128 0.51 904 5.30 Remaining years 14,008 6.52 498 0.38 234 5.30 Total $ 20,499 $ 1,644 $ 4,314 Fair value $ 25,421 $ 1,644 $ 4,820 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2012, or 2011, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: 69 Table of Contents In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2012 2011 2012 2011 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD - 219 $ - (8) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 2,573 790 31 - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD - 648 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD - 292 - (7) Buy U.S. dollar, sell euro USD 7 - - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD 90 - - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD 43 - (2 ) - Buy euro, sell Norwegian krone EUR - 3 - - Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 96 - - - Sell euro, buy British pound EUR - 64 - 5 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

Due to discontinued operations reporting, as more fully described below, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips’ earnings. The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18,400 employees worldwide and total assets of $118 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Discontinued Operations On April 30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our “Downstream business”), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and the sale of our Algeria business, and we have agreements to sell our Nigeria business. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our asset base reflects our legacy as a major company with a strategic focus on higher-margin developments. Our diverse portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve this value proposition through optimizing our portfolio, investing in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility. 35 Table of Contents We achieved several strategic milestones in 2013. We delivered on our non-core asset sales, advanced our growth programs, achieved exploration success and increased shareholder distributions. These accomplishments will position us to meet our goal of 3 to 5 percent annual production and margin growth beginning in 2014. During 2013, we generated $15.8 billion in cash from continuing operations, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion and generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from dispositions of non-core assets. This brings the total proceeds received to $12.4 billion for the 2012–2013 program, which has exceeded our goal of raising $8–$10 billion in proceeds from disposition of non-strategic assets during 2012 and 2013. Consistent with our commitment to offer our shareholders a compelling dividend, in July 2013, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent to $0.69 per share. In 2013, we achieved production of 1,545 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), including production from discontinued operations of 43 MBOED. With the startup of major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine in 2013, final preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai, and a portfolio of high-margin opportunities, we have the momentum to begin delivering our volume growth goals in 2014. We funded a $16.9 billion capital program in 2013 and fully prepaid a $2.8 billion joint venture acquisition obligation to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. Our 2013 capital program yielded a strong organic reserve replacement, as our annual organic reserve replacement ratio was 179 percent. The organic reserve additions represent a continuing portfolio shift to higher-value liquids and reflect increased levels of activity in our development programs and major projects. Our 2014 capital budget of $16.7 billion will target our diverse portfolio of global opportunities, with approximately 55 percent of the budget allocated toward North America and 45 percent toward Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will continue to build our inventory for the future. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2013 included the following: • Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 179 percent from reserve additions of approximately 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. • Achieved annual production of 1,545 MBOED, including continuing operations of 1,502 MBOED and discontinued operations of 43 MBOED, and generated earnings of $8.0 billion. • Increased quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent. • Generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions. • Announced two deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries at Coronado and Gila, adding to the existing Shenandoah and Tiber discoveries in 2009. • Eagle Ford and Bakken production increased 60 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. • Commenced production from major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine, with preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai in 2014. Business Environment The business environment for the energy industry has historically experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the global financial crisis and recession which began in 2008; supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts; environmental laws; tax regulations; governmental policies; and weather-related disruptions. Recently, North America’s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of 36 Table of Contents supply, as a result of advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of shale production, successful exploration and development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. These dynamics generally influence world energy markets and commodity prices. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices, which can be very volatile; therefore, our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a diverse portfolio of assets, which we believe will provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles. Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: • Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2013 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry’s ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in adding to our proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2013, our organic reserve replacement was 145 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on organic growth in volumes and margins through higher-margin oil, condensate and LNG projects and limited investment in North American 37 Table of Contents conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment decision to the time the asset is operational and generates financial returns. Our actual capital program for 2013 was $16.9 billion, excluding a $2.8 billion prepayment to FCCL for the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation. Our capital budget for 2014 is $16.7 billion. Approximately 13 percent of the 2014 capital budget is allocated toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio, including planned turnarounds; 39 percent is allocated to high-margin development drilling programs, mostly in North America, which is intended to offset natural field decline from our producing assets; 35 percent is focused on sanctioned major developments, such as Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) and Surmont Phase 2; and 13 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays. • Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell $8–$10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2013, we received proceeds from dispositions of approximately $10.2 billion, which primarily resulted from: o The disposition of our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, located in Kazakhstan. o The sale of our Algeria business. o The sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana. o The sale of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, located in Canada. o The disposition of our 39 percent equity investment in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago. o The disposition of a portion of our working interests in the Poseidon discovery in the Browse Basin and the Goldwyer Shale in the Canning Basin. o The disposition of certain properties located in southwest Louisiana. o The sale of our 10 percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, located in Europe. As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March 31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments. During 2012, we received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the sale of our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and the additional dilution of our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Although we are near completion of the 2012–2013 asset disposition program, we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction. We will prune the portfolio as necessary and direct our capital investments to areas which will achieve our strategic objectives. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. As managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with increased production. 38 Table of Contents • Applying technical capability. We focus on ways to leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices where they matter most. In 2013, we tested new technology as a means to provide remote monitoring capability, as well as new methods that could increase production and reduce water usage and emissions from assets, such as the oil sands and unconventional reservoirs. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. As part of our future workforce planning, we are committed to increasing student interest in energy industry professions by awarding scholarships in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting and finance, as well as providing university internships to attract the best talent. We also recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. Career development is an important investment in our employees and our future, so we focus on continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to accelerate technical and functional skills of our employees. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2013 2012 2011 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 97.90 94.16 95.05 Dated Brent (per barrel) 108.65 111.58 111.27 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 3.65 2.79 4.04 Brent crude oil prices decreased 3 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, to average $108.65 per barrel, as disruptions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supplies were more than offset by non-OPEC production growth. Global oil demand grew 1 percent, or about 1.2 million barrels per day, to 91.2 million barrels per day. The fiscal uncertainties that plagued many developed countries, while not completely resolved, subsided enough to help restore confidence and growth in real economic activity in 2013. WTI crude oil prices increased 4 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, as new infrastructure helped to alleviate the glut at Cushing, Oklahoma, by increasing the movement of physical barrels toward U.S. Gulf Coast refining centers. As a result, the WTI discount to Brent decreased by 38 percent to average $10.75. U.S. crude oil production grew 16 percent to reach an average of 7.5 million barrels per day. The growth was led by shale oil developments such as Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian. U.S. oil demand increased by 2 percent in 2013, as economic growth strengthened. Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 31 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Strong weather-driven demand growth outweighed production growth and drew down high storage inventories. U.S. natural gas consumption rose 2 percent, or 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, to an all-time high of 39 Table of Contents 71.2 billion cubic feet per day. U.S. dry gas production increased 1 percent, by 0.8 billion cubic feet per day, to reach 66.5 billion cubic feet per day, as growth from the Marcellus shale gas play more than offset declines in other areas. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 11 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Our realized bitumen price remained relatively flat in 2013. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2013 totaled $0.5 billion and mainly resulted from impairments of various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted tax legislation in both 2012 and 2011, which increased our U.K. corporate tax rate. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 40 Table of Contents Outlook Due to the ongoing shutdown of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, we intend to exclude Libya from our future production outlooks. Production from continuing operations for 2013 was 1,502 MBOED, or 1,472 MBOED adjusted for Libya. Full-year 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be approximately 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya. First-quarter 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,490 to 1,530 MBOED, excluding Libya. Our Corporate and Other segment earnings are expected to be an after-tax loss of approximately $1.0 billion for the full-year 2014. Freeport LNG Terminal We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG to terminate this agreement, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur in the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600 million. Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, will result in a one-time net cash outflow of approximately $80 million for us. When the agreement becomes effective, we also expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million. At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in operating costs over the next 19 years. For additional information, see Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Alaska $ 2,274 2,276 1,984 Lower 48 and Latin America 1,081 1,029 1,288 Canada 718 (684 ) 91 Europe 1,199 1,498 1,830 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,591 3,996 3,093 Other International (6 ) 359 (377) LUKOIL Investment - - 239 Corporate and Other (820 ) (993 ) (960) Income from continuing operations $ 8,037 7,481 7,188 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 7 percent in 2013. The increase was mainly due to: • Lower impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2013 totaled $289 million after-tax, compared with $900 million after-tax in 2012. • Higher natural gas prices. • A higher proportion of production in higher-margin areas and a continued portfolio shift toward liquids. • Lower production taxes, primarily as a result of lower production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. These items were partially offset by: • Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and China. • Lower gains from asset sales. In 2013, gains from asset dispositions were $1,132 million after-tax, compared with gains of $1,567 million after-tax in 2012. • Higher operating expenses. • Lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices. 42 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 4 percent in 2012. The increase was mainly due to: • Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax. • Higher LNG and crude oil prices. • Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes. • The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million. • The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax. These items were partially offset by: • Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China. • Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices. • Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax. • Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax. 43 Table of Contents Income Statement Analysis 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower natural gas volumes and lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 16 percent in 2013. The increase primarily resulted from higher earnings from FCCL Partnership, mainly as a result of higher bitumen volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 25 percent in 2013. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 20 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 benefit which resulted from the favorable resolution of the Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. The decrease was partly offset by a $150 million insurance settlement in 2013 associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. For information on a separate PDVSA arbitration with the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 10 percent in 2013, largely as a result of lower purchased natural gas volumes, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2013, primarily due to increased drilling activity and production volumes, mostly in the Lower 48, in addition to a charge related to a settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. These increases were partly offset by the reduction of an accrual related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). SG&A expenses decreased 23 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of separation costs, lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. For additional information on pension settlement expense, see Note 19—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration expenses decreased 18 percent in 2013, largely due to lower leasehold impairment costs. Exploration costs in 2012 included the $481 million impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, as a result of the indefinite suspension of the project. Increased 2013 exploration activity and higher dry hole costs, mostly in the Lower 48, partly offset the reduction. DD&A increased 13 percent in 2013. The increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48. Higher production volumes in China partly contributed to the increase. Impairments decreased 22 percent in 2013. Impairments in 2013 mainly consisted of increases in the asset retirement obligation (ARO) for properties located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Impairments in 2012 consisted of impairments of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline and impairments of late-life U.K. properties. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 19 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. Interest and debt expense decreased 14 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of lower interest expense from lower average debt levels. 44 Table of Contents See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from: • Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes. • Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment. Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG and the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes. Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48. SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66. Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment. Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, and impairments of various late-life properties, mostly located in the United Kingdom. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes. Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 45 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2013 2012 2011 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD)* 581 595 622 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 156 156 145 Bitumen (MBD) 109 93 67 Natural gas (MMCFD)** 3,939 4,096 4,359 Total Production (MBOED)*** 1,502 1,527 1,561 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 103.32 105.72 105.52 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 41.42 46.36 55.73 Bitumen (per barrel) 53.27 53.91 62.56 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 6.11 5.48 5.80 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 789 626 569 Leasehold impairment 175 719 159 Dry holes 268 155 310 $ 1,232 1,500 1,038 Excludes discontinued operations. *Thousands of barrels per day. **Millions of cubic feet per day.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2013, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. In 2013, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2012, mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production, due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and the impact from the closure of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012. In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48. 46 Table of Contents Alaska 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,274 2,276 1,984 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 178 188 200 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 15 16 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) 43 55 61 Total Production (MBOED) 200 213 225 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 107.83 109.62 105.95 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.35 4.22 4.56 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2013, Alaska contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Alaska earnings in 2013 were flat compared with 2012 earnings. Earnings in 2013 were mainly impacted by lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices. These decreases to earnings were mostly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from lower prices, higher 2013 capital spending and lower crude oil production volumes. Additionally, 2013 earnings benefitted from the impact of a ruling by the FERC. In 2012, the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013, the FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. Under the terms of the agreements, we paid the other remaining owners of TAPS $355 million, including interest, in the third quarter of 2013. As a result of FERC approval of these agreements, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. The FERC ruling approving these agreements has been appealed by certain parties to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Production averaged 200 MBOED in 2013, a decrease of 6 percent compared with 2012. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower planned downtime. 2012 vs. 2011 Alaska earnings in 2012 increased 15 percent compared with earnings in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses. Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime. 47 Table of Contents Lower 48 and Latin America 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 1,081 1,029 1,288 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 152 123 94 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 91 85 74 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,490 1,493 1,556 Total Production (MBOED) 491 457 428 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 93.79 91.67 92.79 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 31.48 35.45 50.55 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 3.50 2.67 3.99 During 2013, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 29 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production. The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, as well as exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia. 2013 vs. 2012 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings increased 5 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Earnings in 2013 largely benefitted from higher crude oil and NGL volumes, higher gains from asset dispositions, mostly as a result of the $288 million after-tax gain on disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park, higher natural gas and crude oil prices and lower impairments. These increases were partially offset by higher DD&A, as a result of higher crude oil production, as well as the absence of the 2012 realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million and the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration, as more fully described below. Higher operating expenses, higher exploration expenses, which mainly resulted from the Thorn and Ardennes dry holes in the Gulf of Mexico, and lower NGL prices also partially offset the increase in 2013 earnings. For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which was reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For information on a separate PDVSA ICSID arbitration, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2013, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent in the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline and the impact from dispositions. 2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings decreased 20 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil 48 Table of Contents and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. Average production increased 7 percent in 2012, while average crude oil production increased 31 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production.

In 2013, Canada contributed 17 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 20 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Canada operations reported earnings of $718 million in 2013, an increase of $1,402 million, compared with a loss of $684 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 earnings was largely due to: • The $461 million after-tax gain on disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold. • Lower impairments. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. Impairments in 2012 mainly resulted from the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated undeveloped leaseholds. • Higher bitumen volumes, primarily at Christina Lake. • The recognition of additional income of $224 million related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties in a prior year. 49 Table of Contents For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production in Canada increased 1 percent in 2013, while average liquids production increased 13 percent in the same period, primarily from the oil sands. Normal field decline was more than offset by the ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phases D and E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance from western Canada. 2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million, compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments. Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes. Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek in FCCL.

In 2013, our Europe operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 11 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Europe operations reported a 20 percent decrease in 2013 earnings compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2012 included the $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields, compared with the $83 million after-tax gain on sale of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of 50 Table of Contents the recognition of $170 million in additional income tax expense in 2012, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. Average production decreased 17 percent in 2013, primarily due to normal field decline. Major planned maintenance at Greater Ekofisk, higher unplanned downtime, mostly in the East Irish Sea, and asset dispositions also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from Jasmine and Ekofisk South. 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from Europe decreased 18 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly as a result of lower volumes, higher impairments and the U.K. tax increase. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by the gain on disposition of Statfjord and Alba and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. Production decreased 18 percent in 2012, mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom. 51 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 3,591 3,996 3,093 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 80 68 99 Equity affiliates 15 15 16 Total crude oil 95 83 115 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 12 16 12 Equity affiliates 7 8 7 Total natural gas liquids 19 24 19 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 709 672 695 Equity affiliates 481 485 492 Total natural gas 1,190 1,157 1,187 Total Production (MBOED) 312 300 332 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 104.78 108.20 109.84 Equity affiliates 105.44 108.07 106.96 Total crude oil 104.88 108.18 109.46 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 73.82 79.26 72.87 Equity affiliates 73.31 77.30 70.62 Total natural gas liquids 73.63 78.64 71.98 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 10.61 10.63 9.82 Equity affiliates 8.98 8.54 5.93 Total natural gas 9.95 9.75 8.21 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has producing operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Bangladesh and Brunei. During 2013, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 30 percent of our natural gas production. 2013 vs. 2012 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 10 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings was largely due to: • Lower gains from asset dispositions. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 included the $937 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business, in addition to the $133 million after-tax loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased production in China. • A $116 million after-tax charge associated with a settlement. 52 Table of Contents • Lower crude oil prices. • Higher operating expenses and production taxes. • The absence of a $72 million tax-related charge in 2012. These decreases to earnings were partially offset by: • Higher crude oil and LNG volumes. • A $146 million after-tax insurance settlement associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. • The absence of an $89 million after-tax charge related to the Bohai Bay settlement with the China State Oceanic Administration in 2012. • Higher equity earnings, mainly due to an $85 million tax benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Average production increased 4 percent in 2013. The improvement was largely due to: • Increased production in Bohai Bay, China. • New production from Panyu in the South China Sea. • The continued ramp-up of production in Malaysia. • Lower planned downtime, mainly from our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and the Vietnam disposition. 2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 29 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 consisted of the Vietnam gain and the APLNG loss on further dilution from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent, compared with a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent in 2011. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes. Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China. 53 Table of Contents Other International 2013 2012 2011 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (6 ) 359 (377) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 26 40 8 Equity affiliates 4 13 29 Total crude oil 30 53 37 Natural gas (MMCFD) 25 18 1 Total Production (MBOED) 34 56 37 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 107.21 110.75 98.30 Equity affiliates 72.43 96.50 101.62 Total crude oil 101.91 107.56 101.14 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 5.38 5.55 0.09 The Other International segment includes producing operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Angola, Senegal and Azerbaijan. During 2013, Other International contributed 4 percent of our worldwide liquids production. 2013 vs. 2012 Other International operations reported a loss of $6 million in 2013, compared with earnings of $359 million in 2012. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to the absence of the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. Lower volumes from Libya also contributed to the reduction. These decreases were partially offset by lower impairments. Earnings in 2012 included a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Average production decreased 39 percent in 2013, largely as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya at the end of July 2013 and the disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher production from Libya during the first six months of 2013, compared with the ramp-up of production in 2012 following their period of civil unrest. Libya production remains shut-in, as the Es Sider Terminal closure has continued into the first quarter of 2014. 2012 vs. 2011 Other International earnings were $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the NMNG disposition, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by the N Block impairment. Average production increased 51 percent in 2012, mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG. 54 Table of Contents Asset Dispositions In 2013, we sold our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan for $5.4 billion, and we sold our Algeria business for $1.65 billion. We also have agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. Results of operations related to Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Form 10-K.

LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2013 2012 2011 Income from Continuing Operations $ - - 239 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2013 2012 2011 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (530 ) (648 ) (710) Corporate general and administrative expenses (213 ) (313 ) (190) Technology (6 ) (4 ) 15 Separation costs - (84 ) (25) Other (71 ) 56 (50) $ (820 ) (993 ) (960) 2013 vs. 2012 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement in 2012 and lower interest expense on lower average debt levels. These improvements were partially offset by the absence of the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. For additional information on the ICC arbitration, see the Results of Operations for Lower 48 and Latin America. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 32 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax, compared with $87 million after-tax in 2012. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology. Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. 55 Table of Contents The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. “Other” expenses increased $127 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher tax-related adjustments, the absence of a $39 million after-tax settlement which benefitted 2012 and higher foreign currency transaction losses. 2012 vs. 2011 Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Technology reported a loss of $4 million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues. Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The improvement in “Other” in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39 million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses. 56 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 15,801 13,458 13,953 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 286 464 5,693 Cash and cash equivalents 6,246 3,618 5,780 Short-term debt 589 955 1,013 Total debt 21,662 21,725 22,623 Total equity 52,492 48,427 65,749 Percent of total debt to capital* 29 % 31 26 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 8 % 9 10 * Capital includes total debt and total equity. ** Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2013, we received $10,220 million in proceeds from asset sales. We used the remaining $748 million of our restricted cash balance, received in connection with the separation of Phillips 66, solely to pay dividends. During 2013, the primary uses of our available cash were $15,537 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $3,334 million to pay dividends on our common stock; $2,810 million to prepay the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation with our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership; and $946 million to repay debt. During 2013, cash and cash equivalents increased by $2,628 million, to $6,246 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital expenditures and investments, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2013, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $15,801 million, a 17 percent increase from 2012. The increase was primarily related to lower income taxes due to a greater proportion of volumes in areas with more favorable fiscal regimes. During 2012, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,458 million, compared with $13,953 million in 2011. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their 57 Table of Contents timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our 2013 production from continuing operations averaged 1,502 MBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2014 is expected to be 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2013 was 147 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 179 percent of 2013 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2013, our reserve replacement was 69 percent (including 95 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 145 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2013 were $10,220 million, primarily from the sale of our 8.4 percent equity interest in Kashagan, the sale of our Algeria business, the sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, the sale of our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, the sale of our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park and the sale of a portion of our working interests in Browse and Canning basins. This compares with proceeds of $2,132 million in 2012, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea. As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March 31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2013, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. 58 Table of Contents Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $961 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013, compared with $1,055 million at December 31, 2012. Since we had $961 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2013. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investors Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we had direct bank letters of credit of $827 million and $852 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our debt balance at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, was $21.7 billion. During 2013, we repaid bonds at maturity totaling $850 million. In June 2013, we incurred a capital lease obligation of $906 million. For more information, see Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007. The principal portion of these payments totaled $772 million in 2013. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 59 Table of Contents This $2,810 million prepayment substantially increases the FCCL Partnership’s ability to make distributions to its partners or fund future capital requirements without contributions from the partners. Interest accrued at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. In July 2013, we announced a 4.5 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 69 cents per share. Additionally, on February 5, 2014, we announced a dividend of 69 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 3, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2014. In February 2014, the $400 million 4.75% Notes due 2014 were repaid at maturity.

Purchase obligations of $10,538 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. 60 Table of Contents (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2014 through 2018.

Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, totaled $40.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in the Lower 48, including the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays, and the Permian Basin. • Development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Jasmine and Clair Ridge areas, and appraisal activities in the Greater Clair Area. • Oil sands development and ongoing liquids-focused plays in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, and the Western North Slope. • Exploration leases and wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Continued development of offshore fields in Malaysia and ongoing exploration and development activity onshore and offshore Indonesia and Australia. 61 Table of Contents 2014 CAPITAL BUDGET Our 2014 capital budget is $16.7 billion, essentially flat compared with our 2013 capital program. We are directing approximately 55 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to North America. These funds are expected to be directed toward: • Increased investment in the Company’s successful development drilling programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian. • Higher allocation of capital to Alaska compared to 2013, reflecting increased spending on the CD5 development and higher activity resulting from improved fiscal terms from the passage of the More Alaska Production Act. • Increased exploration and appraisal activity in several North American unconventional plays, including the Permian, Niobrara, Canol and Duvernay. • Higher levels of spending at Surmont Phase 2, in anticipation of first production in 2015. • Increased conventional exploration drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are directing approximately 45 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. These funds are expected to be directed toward: • Peak spending at the APLNG Project, in anticipation of first LNG sales. • Conventional exploration drilling offshore Angola, Senegal and the Browse Basin. • Investments in Eldfisk II, Britannia Long-term Compression and Clair Ridge. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 14—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise 63 Table of Contents to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2012, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 11 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2013, we had been notified of 4 new sites, bringing the number of unresolved sites with potential liability to 15 sites. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $546 million in 2013 and are expected to be about $580 million per year in 2014 and 2015. Capitalized environmental costs were $357 million in 2013 and are expected to be about $480 million per year in 2014 and 2015. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, 64 Table of Contents operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2013, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $348 million, compared with $364 million at December 31, 2012, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2013 was approximately $2 million (net share pre-tax). • A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2013 was approximately $6 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2013 was approximately $44 million (net share pre-tax). • Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation, which took effect in July 2012. Our cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation in 2013 was approximately $10 million (net share pre-tax). 65 Table of Contents In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2012 the Company reduced GHG emissions by approximately 1,000,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The Company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $6 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2013, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,830 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $558 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 56 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2014 would increase by approximately $39 million. At year-end 2013, the remaining $6,708 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2014. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 67 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2013, total suspended well costs were $994 million, compared with $1,038 million at year-end 2012. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 68 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2013, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $59 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2013 was approximately $7.0 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2013. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2013 would have increased by an estimated $370 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance 69 Table of Contents considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $120 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. See Note 19—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 70 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to, execute asset dispositions. • Inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. 71 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: — Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. — Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2013 and 2012, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation at year-end 2012 was estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an effective yield rate of 0.7 percent. The discount rate was based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration, adjusted for ConocoPhillips’ average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million. 72 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Joint VentureAcquisition Obligation Expected Maturity Date FixedRateMaturity AverageInterestRate FloatingRateMaturity AverageInterestRate FixedRateMaturity AverageInterestRate Year-End 2013 2014 $ 400 4.75 % $ 100 0.21 % $ - - % 2015 1,500 4.60 - - - - 2016 1,273 5.52 861 0.02 - - 2017 1,001 1.06 - - - - 2018 797 5.74 - - - - Remaining years 14,121 6.27 283 0.05 - - Total $ 19,092 $ 1,244 $ - Fair value $ 22,309 $ 1,244 $ - Year-End 2012 2013 $ 850 5.75 % $ 91 0.25 % $ 772 5.30 % 2014 400 4.75 - - 814 5.30 2015 1,500 4.60 - - 858 5.30 2016 1,273 5.52 964 0.25 904 5.30 2017 1,001 1.06 - - 234 5.30 Remaining years 14,918 6.25 283 0.19 - 5.30 Total $ 19,942 $ 1,338 $ 3,582 Fair value $ 25,011 $ 1,338 $ 3,968 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. 73 Table of Contents At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2013, or 2012, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2013 and 2012, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2013 2012 2013 2012 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD - 2,573 - 31 Buy U.S. dollar, sell euro USD - 7 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD - 90 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD 6 43 - (2) Buy euro, sell British pound EUR - 96 - - Buy British pound, sell euro GBP 17 - - - * Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD), euro (EUR), and British pound (GBP). ** Denominated in U.S. dollars.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. At December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 19,100 people worldwide and had total assets of $117 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Basis of Presentation Effective April 1, 2014, the Other International segment was restructured to focus on enhancing our capability to operate in emerging and new country business units. As a result, we moved the Latin America and Poland businesses from the historically presented Lower 48 and Latin America segment and the Europe segment to the Other International segment. Results of operations for the Lower 48, Europe and Other International segments have been revised for all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial results, and the impact on our segment presentation was immaterial. For additional information, see Note 23—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our asset base reflects our legacy as a major company with a strategic focus on higher-margin developments. Our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Since the separation of the downstream business in 2012, our value proposition to our shareholders has been to deliver 3 to 5 percent production and 3 to 5 percent cash margin growth, normalized for changes in commodity prices, pay a competitive dividend, improve financial returns, and maintain our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. This value proposition was predicated on capital expenditures of approximately $16 billion annually. 32 Table of Contents We achieved our value proposition in 2014 and met our strategic objectives; however, in response to a significant downturn in commodity prices beginning in the second half of 2014, we have elected to reduce our 2015 capital program to $11.5 billion. At this level of capital, we expect to achieve 2 to 3 percent production growth in 2015. The dividend remains our top priority, and we anticipate cash flow neutrality (cash from continuing operations sufficient to fund our dividend and capital program) in 2017. We continue to monitor the environment and will exercise additional capital reductions or balance sheet flexibility, as appropriate, to withstand this cycle. Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2014 included the following: • Achieved 4 percent full-year production growth from continuing operations, excluding Libya. • Realized 8 percent price-normalized cash margin per BOE growth. • Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 124 percent from reserve additions of approximately 0.7 billion BOE. • Completed the asset disposition program with sale of Nigerian business for $1.4 billion. • Achieved a combined 35 percent year-over-year production increase in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. • Commenced production from five major projects at Siakap North-Petai, Foster Creek Phase F, Britannia Long-Term Compression, Gumusut and Kebabangan, as well as first production from Eldfisk II in January 2015. • Discovered oil in two new plays offshore Senegal. • Ended the year with $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We accomplished several strategic milestones in 2014. Through major project startups, development drilling and increased investment in higher-margin areas, we achieved 4 percent production growth from continuing operations, excluding Libya. Our net income attributable to ConocoPhillips per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) decreased 27 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. This reduction mainly resulted from lower gains from dispositions and higher impairments. Our cash margin per BOE, normalized based on 2013 prices, increased 8 percent over the same period, which reflects an underlying portfolio shift to liquids and more favorable fiscal regimes. For additional information on the calculations for Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips per BOE and Price Normalized Cash Margin per BOE, see “Non-GAAP Reconciliation: Price Normalized Cash Margin per BOE,” beginning on page 63. In 2014 we achieved production of 1,561 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), including production from discontinued operations of 21 MBOED. Excluding Libya, our production from continuing operations was 1,532 MBOED, compared with 1,472 MBOED in 2013. The startup of several major projects in 2014 and continued success in shale plays enabled us to achieve our volume growth target. With the startup of Eldfisk II in early 2015, anticipated startups at Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) and Surmont 2 in 2015, and ongoing development program activity, we believe we can achieve production growth of 2 to 3 percent in 2015. Consistent with our commitment to offer our shareholders a competitive dividend, in July 2014 our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 5.8 percent to $0.73 per share. During 2014 we generated $16.6 billion in cash from continuing operations, which included a one-time $1.3 billion distribution from our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership, and we generated $1.6 billion in proceeds from dispositions of non-core assets. We also paid dividends on our common stock of $3.5 billion and ended the year with $5.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We funded a $17.1 billion capital program in 2014, which yielded a strong, annual organic reserve replacement ratio of 124 percent. The organic reserve additions represent a continuing portfolio shift to higher-value liquids and reflect increased levels of activity in our development programs and major projects. 33 Table of Contents In December 2014 we announced a capital budget of $13.5 billion for 2015, a reduction of 21 percent compared with actual capital spending of $17.1 billion in 2014. In January 2015 we further reduced the capital budget by $2.0 billion, due to the ongoing decline in commodity prices. The $5.6 billion reduction primarily reflects the deferral of spending on certain North American unconventional plays, lower spending on major projects, several of which are nearing completion, and the deferral of some exploration programs. Capital spending on several major projects has peaked, such as APLNG, Surmont 2 and Eldfisk II, and we will realize the benefit of production growth from these projects over the next few years. This lower level of investment associated with major projects allows us to have increasing flexibility with our capital program. Our 2015 capital budget of $11.5 billion will target our diverse portfolio of global opportunities and will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia; the completion of major projects, such as APLNG and Surmont 2; as well as exploration opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa which will continue to build our inventory for the future. Business Environment In the first half of 2014, the energy industry experienced strong prices for crude oil, driven by geopolitical tensions impacting supplies, as well as global oil demand growth. This was followed by an abrupt decline in prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 to near five-year lows, as surging production growth from U.S. shale and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain current production outweighed fears of supply disruptions. This, combined with lower forecasts for global oil demand growth, caused crude oil prices to plummet to the $60-per-barrel-range at the end of 2014. More recently, prices for WTI and Brent have continued to decrease to the mid-$40-per-barrel-range, less than half of June 2014 prices. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions, which have impacted our operations and profitability and are largely due to factors beyond our control. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Other dynamics which have influenced world energy markets and commodity prices included the global financial crisis and recession which began in 2008, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. Additionally, North America’s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, as a result of advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of shale production, successful exploration and development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. In order to navigate through a volatile market, our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a diverse and flexible portfolio of assets which will provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles. Operating and Financial Priorities Other important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: • Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2014 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry’s ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters. 34 Table of Contents • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in adding to our proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2014, our organic reserve replacement was 143 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Disciplined investment approach. We participate in a capital-intensive industry, which often experiences long lead times from the time an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on organic growth in volumes and margins through higher-margin oil, condensate and LNG projects and limited investment in North American natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we have experienced a corresponding shift in our production mix. In 2014 our average liquids production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased 7 percent compared with 2013. In 2013 our average liquids production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased 2 percent compared with 2012. Our 2015 capital budget is $11.5 billion, a reduction of 33 percent compared with our actual 2014 capital spend of $17.1 billion. The decrease mainly reflects a slower pace of development on North American unconventional plays, the elimination of peak spending on major capital projects due to their anticipated startup in 2015, and the deferral of certain exploration programs. Our capital budget will be allocated toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio; higher-margin development drilling programs, primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken; sanctioned major developments, specifically the completion of APLNG and Surmont 2; and our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target conventional activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and Nova Scotia, as well as unconventional activity in North America. In response to weakening commodity prices, we plan to slow the pace of certain investments, such as in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, as well as emerging unconventional plays in the Permian, Niobrara, Montney and Duvernay. We retain the flexibility to increase or decrease investment activity and may reassess our near-term investment decisions as necessary. • Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic assets. In 2012 we announced plans to sell $8–$10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. We completed this disposition program with the July 2014 sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates. As part of this program, we generated $14.0 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions through December 31, 2014. 35 Table of Contents Although we have completed the asset disposition program, we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction. We will optimize the portfolio as necessary and direct our capital investments to areas we expect will achieve our strategic objectives. • Controlling costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry. • Applying technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. In 2014 we tested new technology as a means to provide remote monitoring capability, as well as new methods that could increase production and reduce water usage and emissions from assets, such as the oil sands and unconventional reservoirs. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. As part of our future workforce planning, we are committed to increasing student interest in energy industry professions by awarding scholarships in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting and finance, as well as providing university internships to attract the best talent. We also recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We offer continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to accelerate technical and functional skills of our employees. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: 36 Table of Contents Brent crude oil prices averaged $76.27 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 30 percent compared with $109.27 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2013. December 2014 prices for Brent crude oil averaged $62.53 per barrel, a decline of 44 percent compared with June 2014 average prices of $111.65 per barrel. Industry crude prices for WTI averaged $73.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 25 percent compared with $97.38 in the same quarter of 2013. WTI prices in December 2014 averaged $59.50 per barrel, a 43 percent decrease compared with June 2014 average prices of $105.24 per barrel. Crude oil prices have continued to rapidly decline in the first quarter of 2015 to their lowest levels in the past six years to the mid-$40-per-barrel-range, driven downward by rising production, particularly from U.S. shale oil and reduced disruptions from Middle East production, OPEC’s decision to maintain current production and weaker-than-expected demand in Europe and Asia. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $4.04 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 12 percent compared with the same period in 2013. Average Henry Hub prices were relatively strong in 2014, as prices averaged $4.43 per MCF in 2014 compared with $3.65 in 2013. This was the result of a cold start to 2014; however, natural gas prices softened later in the year due to very strong production growth, particularly from the northeast United States, and a mild start to the 2014/2015 heating season. Domestic natural gas liquids prices experienced a similar decline to crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, as our domestic realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $24.93 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 27 percent compared with $34.33 per barrel in the same quarter of 2013. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. Declining global crude oil prices have resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price experiencing a 50 percent decline from June 2014 to December 2014, from $86.55 per barrel to $43.24 per barrel. Consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a significant decrease in the second half of 2014. Our total average realized price from continuing operations was $64.59 per BOE in 2014, a decrease of 4 percent compared with $67.62 per BOE in 2013, which reflected lower average realized prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, partly offset by higher bitumen and natural gas prices. Our total average realized prices for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $52.88 per BOE, a reduction of 19 percent compared with $65.41 per BOE in the same period of 2013. The reduction in the fourth quarter of 2014 mainly reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our Company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. 37 Table of Contents • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. For additional information on our impairments in 2014, 2013 and 2012, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended or significantly curtailed since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted tax legislation in both 2012 and 2011, which increased our U.K. corporate tax rate. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Outlook The company expects to deliver 2 to 3 percent production growth in 2015 from continuing operations, excluding Libya. First-quarter 2015 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,570 MBOED to 1,610 MBOED, excluding Libya. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the Company’s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Alaska $ 2,041 2,274 2,276 Lower 48 (22 ) 754 745 Canada 940 718 (684 ) Europe 804 1,229 1,517 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,008 3,591 3,996 Other International (90 ) 291 624 Corporate and Other (874 ) (820 ) (993 ) Income from continuing operations $ 5,807 8,037 7,481 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 28 percent in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to: • Lower crude oil prices. • Lower gains from asset sales. Gains realized in 2014 were approximately $70 million after-tax, compared with gains realized in 2013 of $1,132 million after-tax. • Higher operating expenses, which included the 2014 recognition of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. • Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2014 totaled $662 million after-tax, compared with $289 million after-tax in 2013. • Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and the United Kingdom, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada related to reserve bookings. • Higher exploration expenses. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher volumes; lower production taxes, which mainly resulted from higher capital spending, lower prices and lower production volumes in Alaska; and higher natural gas and LNG prices. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 7 percent in 2013. The increase was mainly due to: • Lower impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2013 totaled $289 million after-tax, compared with $900 million after-tax in 2012. • Higher natural gas prices. • A higher proportion of production in higher-margin areas and a continued portfolio shift toward liquids. • Lower production taxes, primarily as a result of lower production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. 39 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: • Higher DD&A expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and China. • Lower gains from asset sales. In 2013, gains from asset dispositions were $1,132 million after-tax, compared with gains of $1,567 million after-tax in 2012. • Higher operating expenses. • Lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices. Income Statement Analysis 2014 vs. 2013 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 3 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher crude oil and bitumen volumes and higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 14 percent in 2014, primarily as a result of higher earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher bitumen volumes and prices. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from APLNG, mostly as a result of higher operating expenses and DD&A. Gain on dispositions decreased $1,144 million in 2014. Gains realized in 2014 mostly resulted from the disposition of certain properties in western Canada. For additional information on gains realized in prior years, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Production and operating expenses increased 23 percent in 2014, largely due to the $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. Higher drilling and maintenance activity, mostly in the Lower 48, Australia, Alaska and Europe, in addition to the absence of the 2013 benefit of a $142 million accrual reduction related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), also contributed to the increase. These increases were partly offset by the absence of a $155 million charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay. For additional information on the Freeport LNG transaction, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 14 percent in 2014, mainly due to the absence of pension settlement expenses. Exploration expenses increased 66 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of higher impairments of undeveloped leasehold costs, primarily in the Lower 48 and Canada, and higher dry hole costs, mostly associated with the Gulf of Mexico and Angola. For additional information on the leasehold impairments, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A increased 12 percent in 2014. This increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the United Kingdom and the Lower 48, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada associated with year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes. Impairments increased 62 percent in 2014. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 28 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower production taxes, which resulted from higher capital spending, lower crude oil prices and lower production volumes in Alaska. Interest and debt expense increased 6 percent in 2014, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects, partly offset by lower interest expense from lower average debt levels and a $28 million benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. 40 Table of Contents See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower natural gas volumes and lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 16 percent in 2013. The increase primarily resulted from higher earnings from FCCL Partnership, mainly as a result of higher bitumen volumes. Gain on dispositions decreased 25 percent in 2013. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 20 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 benefit which resulted from the favorable resolution of the Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. The decrease was partly offset by a $150 million insurance settlement in 2013 associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. For information on a separate PDVSA arbitration with the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 10 percent in 2013, largely as a result of lower purchased natural gas volumes, partly offset by higher natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2013, primarily due to increased drilling activity and production volumes, mostly in the Lower 48, in addition to a charge related to a settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. These increases were partly offset by the $142 million accrual reduction associated with FERC approval of pooling agreements with the TAPS owners. SG&A expenses decreased 23 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of separation costs, lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. For additional information on pension settlement expense, see Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration expenses decreased 18 percent in 2013, largely due to lower leasehold impairment costs. Exploration costs in 2012 included the $481 million impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, as a result of the indefinite suspension of the project. Increased 2013 exploration activity and higher dry hole costs, mostly in the Lower 48, partly offset the reduction. DD&A increased 13 percent in 2013. The increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48. Higher production volumes in China partly contributed to the increase. Impairments decreased 22 percent in 2013 and mainly consisted of increases in the asset retirement obligation for properties located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 19 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska. Interest and debt expense decreased 14 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of lower interest expense from lower average debt levels. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 41 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2014 2013 2012 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD)* 595 581 595 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 159 156 156 Bitumen (MBD) 129 109 93 Natural gas (MMCFD)** 3,943 3,939 4,096 Total Production (MBOED)*** 1,540 1,502 1,527 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 92.80 103.32 105.72 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 38.99 41.42 46.36 Bitumen (per barrel) 55.13 53.27 53.91 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 6.57 6.11 5.48 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 879 789 626 Leasehold impairment 562 175 719 Dry holes 604 268 155 $ 2,045 1,232 1,500 Excludes discontinued operations. *Thousands of barrels per day. **Millions of cubic feet per day.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2014, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia. Total production from continuing operations, including Libya, increased 3 percent in 2014, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. The increase in total average production in 2014 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and the ramp up of production from Jasmine in the United Kingdom and Christina Lake in Canada, and increased drilling programs, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline, higher planned downtime, shut-in Libya production due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and unfavorable market impacts. Adjusted for Libya, production from continuing operations increased by 60 MBOED, or 4 percent, compared with 2013. In 2013 average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2012, mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012. 42 Table of Contents Alaska 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 2,041 2,274 2,276 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 162 178 188 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 13 15 16 Natural gas (MMCFD) 49 43 55 Total Production (MBOED) 183 200 213 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 97.68 107.83 109.62 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 5.42 4.35 4.22 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2014 Alaska contributed 20 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Alaska earnings decreased 10 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings. The decrease was largely due to lower crude oil prices and volumes; the absence of a $97 million after-tax benefit associated with a FERC ruling in 2013, more fully described below; higher operating expenses; and a $36 million after-tax impairment related to a cancelled project. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from higher 2014 capital spending and lower crude oil prices and volumes. Higher LNG sales volumes and prices also partially offset the decrease in 2014 earnings. In 2012 the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013 FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. As a result, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. Average production decreased 9 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly as a result of normal field decline and higher planned maintenance, partly offset by lower unplanned downtime. 2013 vs. 2012 Alaska earnings in 2013 were flat compared with 2012 earnings. Earnings in 2013 were mainly impacted by lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices. These decreases to earnings were mostly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from lower prices, higher 2013 capital spending and lower crude oil production volumes. Additionally, 2013 earnings benefitted from the FERC ruling discussed above. Average production decreased 6 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower planned downtime. 43 Table of Contents Lower 48 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (22 ) 754 745 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 188 152 123 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 97 91 85 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,491 1,490 1,493 Total Production (MBOED) 533 491 457 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 84.18 93.79 91.67 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 30.74 31.48 35.45 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.29 3.50 2.67 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2014 the Lower 48 contributed 32 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 The Lower 48 reported a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014, compared with earnings of $754 million after-tax in 2013. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to: • Higher operating expenses, which included the $545 million after-tax charge to earnings due to the Freeport LNG termination agreement. • Lower crude oil prices. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil production. • Higher impairments. Earnings in 2014 were impacted by impairments of approximately $290 million after-tax. Property impairments were not material in 2013. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Higher dry hole costs. Dry hole costs in 2014 were approximately $180 million after-tax, primarily for the nonoperated Coronado wildcat and appraisal wells, the Shenandoah appraisal well and the Deep Nansen wildcat well, all located in the Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole costs in 2013 were approximately $130 million after-tax and mainly consisted of the Ardennes and Thorn wells, also located in the Gulf of Mexico. • An $83 million after-tax loss recognized upon the release of underutilized transportation and storage capacity at rates below our contractual rates. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas prices and a benefit to earnings of approximately $150 million after-tax from marketing third-party natural gas volumes. Rising U.S. production and an increase in pipeline capacity to the Gulf Coast have put downward pressure on Gulf Coast crude oil prices. Prices for Permian Basin crude oil production have been impacted by production increases exceeding pipeline offtake additions. Our average realized prices in the Lower 48 have historically correlated with WTI prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our Lower 48 crude differential versus WTI began to widen. In 2014 our average realized crude oil price of $84.18 per barrel was 10 percent below the WTI price of $93.17 per barrel. 44 Table of Contents Total average production in the Lower 48 increased 9 percent in 2014, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and improved drilling and well performance, partially offset by normal field decline. 2013 vs. 2012 Lower 48 earnings increased 1 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Earnings in 2013 largely benefitted from higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas and crude oil prices and lower impairments. These increases were partially offset by higher DD&A, as a result of higher crude oil production, higher operating expenses, higher exploration expenses, which mainly resulted from the Thorn and Ardennes dry holes, and lower natural gas liquids prices. Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2013, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent in the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline and the impact from dispositions.

In 2014 Canada contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Canada earnings increased 31 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher natural gas and bitumen prices, lower DD&A from western Canada and higher bitumen volumes. The lower DD&A mainly resulted from lower unit-of-production rates related to year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions 45 Table of Contents and lower natural gas production volumes. Earnings in 2014 also included a $47 million tax benefit resulting from a favorable tax settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, mainly as a result of the $461 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold in 2013, as well as the 2013 recognition of a $224 million tax benefit, related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties in a prior year. Lower natural gas volumes also partially offset the increase in 2014 earnings. In addition, earnings in 2014 benefitted from lower impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $138 million after-tax and consisted primarily of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. For additional information on prior year asset sales, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, and for additional information on impairments, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total average production increased 3 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, while bitumen production increased 18 percent over the same period. The continued ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phase E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance were partly offset by normal field decline and higher royalty impacts. 2013 vs. 2012 Canada operations reported earnings of $718 million in 2013, an increase of $1,402 million, compared with a loss of $684 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 earnings was largely due to the Clyden gain on disposition and lower impairments. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada, and impairments in 2012 mainly resulted from the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated undeveloped leaseholds. Higher bitumen volumes, primarily at Christina Lake, and the $224 million favorable tax resolution also benefitted 2013 earnings. Average production in Canada increased 1 percent in 2013, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same period. Normal field decline was more than offset by the ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phases D and E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance from western Canada. 46 Table of Contents Europe 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 804 1,229 1,517 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 126 113 135 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 8 6 7 Natural gas (MMCFD) 461 416 516 Total Production (MBOED) 211 189 228 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 99.56 110.56 113.08 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 52.65 58.36 61.53 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 9.29 10.68 9.76 The Europe segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, as well as exploration activities in Greenland. In 2014 our Europe operations contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for Europe decreased 35 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was primarily due to higher DD&A, which mainly resulted from increased production volumes from Jasmine, lower crude oil and natural gas prices, higher taxes and higher impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $192 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2013 of $118 million after-tax. Lower gains from asset dispositions, mostly due to the absence of the $83 million after-tax gain on the disposition of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013, also contributed to the decrease in 2014 earnings. These decreases were partly offset by higher volumes and a $48 million after-tax benefit from a pension-related settlement. For additional information on the impairments, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production increased 12 percent in 2014, mostly due to the continued ramp-up of production from Jasmine, the Rivers Acid Plant in the East Irish Sea and Ekofisk South, improved drilling and well performance in Norway and lower planned downtime. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime. 2013 vs. 2012 Europe earnings decreased 19 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2012 included the $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields, compared with the $83 million after-tax Interconnector Pipeline gain in 2013. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of the recognition of $192 million in additional income tax expense in 2012, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. Average production decreased 17 percent in 2013, primarily due to normal field decline. Additionally, major planned maintenance at Greater Ekofisk, higher unplanned downtime, mostly in the East Irish Sea, and asset dispositions contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from Jasmine and Ekofisk South. 47 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2014 2013 2012 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 3,008 3,591 3,996 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 79 80 68 Equity affiliates 15 15 15 Total crude oil 94 95 83 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 10 12 16 Equity affiliates 8 7 8 Total natural gas liquids 18 19 24 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 723 709 672 Equity affiliates 505 481 485 Total natural gas 1,228 1,190 1,157 Total Production (MBOED) 317 312 300 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 95.32 104.78 108.20 Equity affiliates 99.01 105.44 108.07 Total crude oil 95.92 104.88 108.18 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 69.36 73.82 79.26 Equity affiliates 67.20 73.31 77.30 Total natural gas liquids 68.46 73.63 78.64 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 9.80 10.61 10.63 Equity affiliates 9.79 8.98 8.54 Total natural gas 9.80 9.95 9.75 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Bangladesh, Brunei and Myanmar. During 2014 Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 31 percent of our natural gas production. 48 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 16 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was largely due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices; higher operating expenses, mostly as a result of major planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility in Australia; lower equity earnings, mainly due to increased activity at APLNG in preparation for startup in mid-2015; and lower sales volumes, primarily crude oil and LNG. These decreases were partially offset by higher LNG prices, higher natural gas volumes and lower taxes. The 2014 benefits from the absence of the $116 million after-tax charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay and a $30 million after-tax legal settlement in 2014 were offset by the absence of a $146 million after-tax insurance settlement received in 2013, also associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. Average production increased 2 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. Increased production, mainly from Indonesia, China and Malaysia, was largely offset by normal field decline and major planned maintenance at Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG. 2013 vs. 2012 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 10 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings was largely due to: • Lower gains from asset dispositions. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 included the $937 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business, in addition to the $133 million after-tax loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased production in China. • A $116 million after-tax charge associated with Bohai Bay. • Lower crude oil prices. • Higher operating expenses and production taxes. • The absence of a $72 million tax-related charge in 2012. These decreases to earnings were partially offset by: • Higher crude oil and LNG volumes. • A $146 million after-tax insurance settlement associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. • The absence of an $89 million after-tax charge related to the Bohai Bay settlement with the China State Oceanic Administration in 2012. • Higher equity earnings, mainly due to an $85 million tax benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Average production increased 4 percent in 2013. The improvement was largely due to increased production in Bohai Bay, China, new production from Panyu in the South China Sea, the continued ramp-up of production in Malaysia and lower planned downtime, mainly from our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and the Vietnam disposition. 49 Table of Contents Other International 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (90 ) 291 624 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 8 26 40 Equity affiliates 4 4 13 Total crude oil 12 30 53 Natural gas (MMCFD) 3 25 18 Total Production (MBOED) 12 34 56 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 86.71 107.21 110.75 Equity affiliates 64.14 72.43 96.50 Total crude oil 77.36 101.91 107.56 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) 3.40 5.38 5.55 The Other International segment includes operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Colombia, Poland, Angola, Senegal and Azerbaijan.

The decrease was primarily due to the lower gains from asset dispositions, mainly from the absence of the $288 million after-tax gain recognized on the 2013 disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago; higher dry hole expenses, mostly due to the $136 million after-tax charge for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola; and lower volumes from Libya. These reductions were partially offset by the recognition of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability. Average production decreased 65 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya, which began at the end of July 2013. The Es Sider Terminal briefly reopened in the third quarter of 2014 and production and liftings resumed temporarily; however, further disruptions occurred in December 2014, and production is shut in again. The 2015 drilling program remains uncertain as a result of the ongoing civil unrest. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings from Other International decreased 53 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 earnings. The reduction was mainly due to the absence of the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration, more fully described, below, and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2013 primarily included the $288 million after-tax Phoenix Park disposition, and gains realized in 2012 mostly consisted of the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia. Additionally, lower volumes from Libya contributed to the reduction in earnings. These decreases were partially offset by lower impairments. Earnings in 2012 included a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea. 50 Table of Contents In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which was reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. Average production decreased 39 percent in 2013, largely as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya at the end of July 2013 and the disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher production from Libya during the first six months of 2013, compared with the ramp-up of production in 2012 following their period of civil unrest. Venezuela Arbitration In October 2014 we filed for arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA, the Venezuela state oil company, for contractual compensation related to the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects. The ICC arbitration is a separate and independent legal action from the investment treaty arbitration against the government of Venezuela, which is pending before an arbitral tribunal under ICSID. For additional information, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Dispositions In July 2014 we sold our Nigeria upstream affiliates, and we transferred our 17 percent interest in the Brass LNG Project to the remaining shareholders in Brass LNG Limited. In 2013 we sold our Algeria business and our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan). Results of operations related to Nigeria, Algeria and Kashagan have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2014 2013 2012 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (502) (530) (648) Corporate general and administrative expenses (194) (213) (313) Technology (93) (6) (4) Separation costs - - (84) Other (85) (71) 56 $ (874) (820) (993) 2014 vs. 2013 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 5 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of a $93 million tax benefit associated with the election of the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States, as well as a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. These improvements were largely offset by lower capitalized interest on projects sold or completed. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense, partly offset by higher benefit-related expenses. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax. We did not incur pension settlement expense in 2014. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands, unconventional reservoirs, LNG, and subsurface, arctic and deepwater technologies, with an underlying commitment to environmental responsibility. Losses from Technology were $93 million in 2014, compared with losses of $6 million in 2013. The reduction in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues and higher research and development expenses. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. 2013 vs. 2012 Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement in 2012 and lower interest expense on lower average debt levels. These improvements were partially offset by the absence of the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. For additional information on the arbitration, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 32 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax, compared with $87 million after-tax in 2012. Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. “Other” expenses increased $127 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher tax-related adjustments, the absence of a $39 million after-tax settlement which benefitted 2012 and higher foreign currency transaction losses. 52 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 16,592 15,801 13,458 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 143 286 464 Cash and cash equivalents 5,062 6,246 3,618 Short-term debt 182 589 955 Total debt 22,565 21,662 21,725 Total equity 52,273 52,492 48,427 Percent of total debt to capital* 30 % 29 31 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 5 % 8 9 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. **Includes effect of interest rate swaps in 2013 and 2012. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2014 we received $1,603 million in proceeds from asset sales and issued $2,994 million of new low-interest notes. The primary uses of our available cash were $17,085 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $3,525 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $2,014 million to repay debt. During 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,184 million, to $5,062 million. In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital expenditures and investments, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2014 cash provided by continuing operating activities was $16,592 million, a 5 percent increase from 2013. Cash flows from operating activities benefited from the $1.3 billion distribution from FCCL in the first quarter of 2014. The distribution from FCCL resulted from our $2.8 billion prepayment of the remaining joint venture acquisition obligation in 2013, which substantially increased the financial flexibility of our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. We do not expect this individually significant distribution to recur in the future under current economic conditions. Cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the $0.5 billion payment of the fee resulting from our termination agreement with Freeport LNG, which was largely offset by the receipt of the Freeport LNG loan repayment. During 2013 cash provided by continuing operations was $15,801 million, compared with $13,458 million in 2012. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. During 2014 and 2013 we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 53 Table of Contents The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2014 production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, averaged 1,532 MBOED. We expect 2015 production to grow 2 to 3 percent, excluding Libya. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2014 was 97 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 124 percent of 2014 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2014, our reserve replacement was 55 percent (including 78 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 138 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2014 were $1.6 billion, primarily from the sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, after customary adjustments, inclusive of deposits previously received. This compares with proceeds of $10.2 billion in 2013, primarily from the sale of our 8.4 percent equity interest in Kashagan, the sale of our Algeria business, the sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, the sale of our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, the sale of our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park and the sale of a portion of our working interest in Browse and Canning basins. For additional information, see Note 2—Discontinued Operations and Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In June 2014 we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total of $7.5 billion to $7.0 billion, with a new expiration date of June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, for the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. 54 Table of Contents Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $900 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $860 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014, compared with $961 million at December 31, 2013. Since we had $860 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.1 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investors Service and “A” by both Standard and Poor’s Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had direct bank letters of credit of $802 million and $827 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 11—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2014, was $22.6 billion, an increase of $903 million from the balance at December 31, 2013. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2014, decreased $407 million compared with December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. During 2014 we repaid notes at maturity totaling $400 million. In November 2014 we redeemed the outstanding $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due January 2015 and issued $3.0 billion of new low-interest notes. For more information, see Note 10—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. In December 2013 we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 55 Table of Contents In October 2014 we announced a dividend of 73 cents per share. The dividend was paid December 1, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2014. Additionally, on February 4, 2015, we announced a dividend of 73 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March 2, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2015. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2014: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to 1 Years Years After Total Year 2–3 4–5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,707 123 2,309 3,843 15,432 Capital lease obligations (b) 858 59 95 102 602 Total debt 22,565 182 2,404 3,945 16,034 Interest on debt and other obligations 16,007 1,169 2,216 1,943 10,679 Operating lease obligations (c) 2,949 568 1,235 515 631 Purchase obligations (d) 17,450 7,099 3,119 1,878 5,354 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,690 294 558 838 - Asset retirement obligations (f) 10,939 592 1,506 1,529 7,312 Accrued environmental costs (g) 344 48 59 34 203 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 53 53 (h ) (h ) (h) Total $ 71,997 10,005 11,097 10,682 40,213 (a) Includes $372 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 10—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $6,573 million. Purchase obligations of $7,778 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2015 through 2019. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2019, see Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Table of Contents (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $389 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, totaled $46.8 billion. The 2014 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale plays, and the Permian Basin. • Development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Oil sands development and ongoing liquids-rich plays in Canada. • In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Aasta Hansteen, Clair Ridge and Jasmine areas, and appraisal activities in the Greater Clair Area. • Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area, as well as exploration and development activities in the Western North Slope. • Exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Continued development in Malaysia and Indonesia and ongoing exploration, appraisal and development activity offshore Australia and China. • Exploration activities in Angola and Senegal. 57 Table of Contents 2015 CAPITAL BUDGET In anticipation of weak commodity prices in 2015, our capital budget was further reduced in January 2015 from the previously announced $13.5 billion to $11.5 billion, a decrease of 33 percent, compared with our actual 2014 capital spend of $17.1 billion. The reduction in capital relative to 2014 primarily reflects deferral of spending on North American unconventional plays, as well as lower spending on major projects, several of which are nearing completion. We are planning to allocate approximately: • 30 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. The 2015 Lower 48 development program capital will continue to target the Eagle Ford and Bakken, with investments being deferred in emerging plays like the Permian and Niobrara. We retain the flexibility to ramp up or down activity in the unconventionals. • 40 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on completion of APLNG and Surmont 2, as well as multiple projects in Alaska, Europe and Malaysia. • 15 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal. This spending will focus on conventional activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and Nova Scotia, as well as unconventional activity in North America. • 15 percent of our 2015 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. 58 Table of Contents Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. 59 Table of Contents The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2013, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 15 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2014, there was no change in the number of sites. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $573 million in 2014 and are expected to be about $560 million per year in 2015 and 2016. Capitalized environmental costs were $497 million in 2014 and are expected to be about $450 million per year in 2015 and 2016. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). 60 Table of Contents Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2014, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $344 million, compared with $348 million at December 31, 2013, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2014 was approximately $3 million (net share pre-tax). • A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July 1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2014 was approximately $6 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. 61 Table of Contents • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The current U.S. administration has established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2014 was approximately $41 million (net share pre-tax). Our cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation carbon tax (repealed in July 2014) in 2014 was approximately $3 million (net share pre-tax). In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2013 the Company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 1,200,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The Company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $7 to $47 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. 62 Table of Contents Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income. NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION: PRICE NORMALIZED CASH MARGIN PER BOE Our financial information includes information prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as non-GAAP information. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it enhances understanding of our consolidated financial information by facilitating comparisons of Company operating performance across time periods. This non-GAAP measure should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure in order not to imply more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. Cash margin is a performance measure we calculate as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income adjusted for the special items included in the following reconciliation; depreciation, depletion and amortization; dry hole costs; impairments; and corporate and other segment earnings. The denominator is production for the stated time period. This performance measure represents the amount of cash generated per BOE of production. Normalized for changes in commodity prices across time periods, changes in this performance measure demonstrate an underlying portfolio shift to liquids and more favorable fiscal regimes.

See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2014, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,275 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $433 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2015 would increase by approximately $22 million. At year-end 2014, the remaining $6,612 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $4 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2015. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 66 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2014, total suspended well costs were $1,299 million, compared with $994 million at year-end 2013. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7—Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. 67 Table of Contents The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2014, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $64 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2014 was approximately $7.9 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2013 and 4.6 billion BOE at the end of 2014. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax DD&A in 2014 would have increased by an estimated $420 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal 68 Table of Contents costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,400 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. See Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 69 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations, use of competing energy sources or the development of alternative energy sources. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. 70 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2014, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was also immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 71 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity AverageInterestRate Floating Rate Maturity AverageInterestRate Year-End 2014 2015 $ - - % $ 107 0.18 % 2016 1,273 5.52 - - 2017 1,001 1.06 - - 2018 797 5.74 - - 2019 2,250 5.75 753 0.18 Remaining years 14,871 5.81 283 0.04 Total $ 20,192 $ 1,143 Fair value $ 24,048 $ 1,143 Year-End 2013 2014 $ 400 4.75 % $ 100 0.21 % 2015 1,500 4.60 - - 2016 1,273 5.52 861 0.02 2017 1,001 1.06 - - 2018 797 5.74 - - Remaining years 14,121 6.27 283 0.05 Total $ 19,092 $ 1,244 Fair value $ 22,309 $ 1,244 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2014, or 2013, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2014 and 2013, were as follows: 72 Table of Contents In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2014 2013 2014 2013 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 7 - (1 ) - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD 44 - - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD - 6 - - Buy British pound, sell euro GBP 20 17 1 - *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and British pound (GBP). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 21 countries. At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $97.5 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Basis of Presentation Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial. For additional information, see Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich North American unconventional assets and oil sands assets in Canada; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. The energy landscape changed dramatically in the past year. Increased supply caused commodity prices to decline substantially. In December 2015, we announced a 2016 operating plan based on $7.7 billion of capital expenditures. This represented a reduction of 24 percent, compared to 2015 actual expenditures, sourced from the completion of several major projects, as well as deferrals, deflation capture and efficiencies across the portfolio. 34 Table of Contents In response to an outlook of lower prices in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as credit tightening across the industry, we revised our 2016 operating plan in February 2016, reducing our capital expenditures guidance by 17 percent, from $7.7 billion to $6.4 billion. We also reduced our quarterly dividend by 66 percent, to $0.25 per share. These actions, taken to maintain a strong balance sheet, will enable us to continue to deliver an investment offering of a competitive dividend, disciplined growth and financial strength. We also believe these actions position the company for success in a lower, more volatile price environment, with the flexibility to adjust to commodity price movements in the future. Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2015 included the following: • Achieved full-year production of 1,589 MBOED; 5 percent production growth from continuing operations, adjusted for Libya, downtime and dispositions. • Lowered operating costs year over year. • Reduced 2015 capital by 41 percent compared with 2014. • Achieved major project startups at APLNG and Surmont 2. • Completed additional startups at Eldfisk II, CD5, Drill Site 2S, Enochdhu and the Brodgar H3 subsea tie-back. • Announced phased exit from deepwater exploration. • Completed approximately $2 billion of non-core asset dispositions across the portfolio. • Ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We accomplished several strategic milestones in 2015. Excluding Libya, our production from continuing operations was 1,589 MBOED, compared with 1,532 MBOED in 2014, a 57 MBOED increase. The production increase was driven by growth from major projects and development programs, as well as improved well performance, partially offset by normal field decline. In 2015, we generated $2 billion from the disposition of certain non-core assets in our portfolio. The full-year 2015 production impact of completed dispositions was 64 MBOED. In 2015, we reviewed our cost structure and took decisive actions to achieve sustainable operating cost reductions across the company. We targeted a $1 billion reduction in operating costs in 2016, compared with 2014. We reduced headcount, including management positions, to streamline decision-making, increased the autonomy in our business units, captured deflation and adjusted our activity levels, which resulted in achieving our stated target in 2015, a year ahead of schedule. Operating costs include production and operating expense; selling, general and administrative expense; and exploration expense excluding dry hole and leasehold impairment expense. We generated $7.6 billion in cash from continuing operations in 2015, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.7 billion and ended the year with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Business Environment In the first half of 2014, strong crude oil prices were supported by geopolitical tensions impacting supplies, as well as global oil demand growth. This was followed by an abrupt decline in prices during the fourth quarter of 2014, as surging production growth from U.S. tight oil and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain production outweighed fears of supply disruptions. These developments, combined with slowing global oil demand growth, caused crude oil prices to plummet to near five-year lows at the end of 2014. Prices remained significantly lower throughout 2015, reaching a ten-year quarterly low of $43.67 for Brent crude oil, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Lower 2015 prices contributed to higher demand growth which was overwhelmed by continued production increase and supply surplus. Brent crude oil was $30.69 in January 2016, reflecting an ongoing decline in prices. 35 Table of Contents The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Among other dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices are global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. North America’s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, primarily due to advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production, successful exploration and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. Our strategy is to sustainably lower our cost structure and maintain a strong balance sheet and a diverse low cost-of-supply portfolio that can provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles. Operating and Financial Priorities Other important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include: • Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2015 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and operational performance. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry’s ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters. • Exercising our capital flexibility. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. Given our view of greater price volatility, we see benefit in having an inventory of value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply opportunities in our resource base. In response to weakening commodity prices, we have slowed the pace of certain discretionary investments, including the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, as well as emerging unconventional plays in the Permian, Niobrara and Montney, and plan to fund additional cash calls in our equity affiliates. We retain the flexibility to increase or decrease investment activity without loss of opportunity, and will reassess our near-term investment decisions as necessary. We use a disciplined approach, focused on value maximization, to set our capital plans. In February 2016, we announced a revised capital budget of $6.4 billion for 2016, a reduction of 37 percent compared with actual capital expenditures of $10.1 billion in 2015. The $3.7 billion reduction primarily reflects lower spending on major projects, deferral of activity primarily in the Lower 48, deflation capture and efficiencies across the portfolio. 36 Table of Contents • Portfolio optimization. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets which strategically fit our development plans. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced plans to reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program. As a result, we terminated our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco and impaired certain Gulf of Mexico leases where we decided not to conduct further activity. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded dry hole expense and impaired additional leases in the Canada segment due to streamlined capital plans. In 2015, we generated approximately $2 billion in proceeds from non-core asset dispositions, including the sales of certain western Canadian properties, producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, producing properties in South Texas, a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas, and our 50 percent equity method investment in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights Company. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives. • Controlling costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: ¡ Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. ¡ Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. ¡ Acquisition of existing fields. Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Additionally, as we undertake cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. Low commodity prices and reduced capital expenditures in 2015 adversely affected our reported year-end proved reserves. In 2015, our organic reserve replacement excluding the impact of sales and purchases was 10 percent. In the five years ended December 31, 2015, our organic reserve replacement was 117 percent, excluding the impact of sales and purchases. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Applying technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the 37 Table of Contents best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas, the prices of which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Crude oil prices have remained under pressure throughout 2015 due to continued global production increase that has outpaced demand growth, leading to a large observed rise in global inventory. Brent crude oil prices averaged $43.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 43 percent compared with $76.27 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices declined 43 percent from $73.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $42.10 per barrel in the same period of 2015. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $2.27 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 44 percent compared with $4.04 per MMBTU in the fourth quarter of 2014. Natural gas prices remained under pressure as production growth continued and U.S. underground gas storage inventories rose to the top of the five-year range in late 2015. Natural gas liquids prices were also lower in 2015. Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $16.42 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $31.07 per barrel in the same quarter of 2014. The expansion in tight oil production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in continued downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. Declining global crude oil prices have resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price experiencing a 52 percent decline, from $73.60 per barrel in 2014 to $35.21 per barrel in 2015. Consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a decrease relative to 2014 price levels. Our realized bitumen price was $18.72 per barrel in 2015, a decrease of 66 percent compared with $55.13 in the same period of 2014. 38 Table of Contents Our total average realized price from continuing operations was $34.34 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $64.59 per BOE in 2014. Our total average realized price was $28.54 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 46 percent compared with $52.88 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2014. The reduction in the prices reflects lower average realized prices across all commodities. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible. Going forward, domestic crude prices should reach a market equilibrium with global crude prices due to the recent overturn of the U.S. crude export bans. • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. In 2015, we recorded pre-tax impairments of $2.2 billion for proved properties and an equity method investment and $1.9 billion for unproved properties, compared with $856 million and $562 million in 2014. For additional information on our impairments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended or significantly curtailed since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. In 2015, the United Kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K. corporate tax rate by 12 percent, while the Alberta provincial government enacted legislation increasing our overall Canadian corporate tax rate by 2 percent. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 39 Table of Contents Outlook Consistent with our revised 2016 operating plan announced in February 2016, our full-year 2016 production from continuing operations is expected to be flat with 2015 production of 1,525 MBOED, which excludes 64 MBOED for the full-year impact of completed dispositions. First-quarter 2016 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,540 MBOED to 1,580 MBOED. Marketing Activities In line with our objective to continuously optimize our portfolio, we are currently marketing certain non-core assets. We expect to generate up to $1 billion in proceeds annually from asset sales. Impairments As a result of lower commodity prices, and as we optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we may incur future impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of future impairment charges at this time, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected for the period in which impairment charges are incurred. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Alaska $ 4 2,041 2,274 Lower 48 (1,932 ) (22 ) 754 Canada (1,044 ) 940 718 Europe and North Africa 409 814 1,297 Asia Pacific and Middle East (406 ) 3,008 3,591 Other International (593 ) (100 ) 223 Corporate and Other (809 ) (874 ) (820 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (4,371 ) 5,807 8,037 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 175 percent in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower commodity prices. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by: • Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. • Higher exploration expenses. Exploration expenses increased mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. The increase included after-tax unproved property impairments of $368 million for our Alaska Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest, $310 million for our Angola Block 36 and 37 Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), $154 million for multiple Gulf of Mexico leases, and $100 million for various Gila Prospect blocks. Additional after-tax dry hole costs and other expenses resulted from a $185 million charge for several properties in Canada, $137 million for two dry holes in Angola, $111 million for a dry hole in the Gila Prospect in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and $246 million related to the termination of our drilling contract with Ensco. • Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), mainly from increased production and commodity price-driven reserve revisions. • Higher restructuring charges and pension settlement expense. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by higher sales volumes, lower production taxes due to reduced commodity prices, lower operating expenses, a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, the absence of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement, gain on sale of assets, and higher licensing revenue. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 28 percent in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to: • Lower crude oil prices. • Lower gains from asset sales. Gains realized in 2014 were approximately $70 million after-tax, compared with gains realized in 2013 of $1,132 million after-tax. • Higher operating expenses, which included the 2014 recognition of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. 41 Table of Contents • Higher impairments. Noncash impairments in 2014 totaled $662 million after-tax, compared with $289 million after-tax in 2013. • Higher DD&A expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and the United Kingdom, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada related to reserve bookings. • Higher exploration expenses. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher volumes; lower production taxes, which mainly resulted from higher capital spending, lower prices and lower production volumes in Alaska; and higher natural gas and LNG prices. Income Statement Analysis 2015 vs. 2014 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 44 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. Lower prices were partly offset by higher crude oil and LNG sales volumes. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 74 percent in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from FCCL Partnership and Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), given lower commodity prices, partly offset by higher volumes and lower operational costs. Gain on dispositions increased by $493 million in 2015. The increase resulted from a $583 million gain from the sales of producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, South Texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas. Gains realized were partly offset by a net loss from the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 66 percent in 2015, mainly due to the absence of 2014 income related to the resolution of a contingent liability in the Other International segment and a legal arbitration settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East, respectively. Purchased commodities decreased 44 percent in 2015, largely as a result of lower natural gas prices and the absence of a $130 million loss in the Lower 48 related to transportation and storage capacity agreements recognized in 2014. Production and operating expenses decreased 21 percent in 2015, largely due to lower operating expense activity, including reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility, favorable foreign exchange-related impacts, and the absence of an $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement in 2014. The decrease in expense was partially offset by restructuring expenses of $206 million in 2015. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 30 percent in 2015, primarily due to $407 million in restructuring and pension settlement expenses in 2015, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs. Exploration expenses increased 105 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, primarily in Alaska, Angola and the Lower 48. Higher dry hole and other exploration costs, including a $253 million pre-tax expense for wells charged to dry hole in Canada, a $383 million expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, and a $176 million charge for two wells charged to dry hole in the Gila prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, also contributed to the increase in exploration expenses. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents DD&A increased 9 percent in 2015. The increase was mainly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48 and Asia Pacific and Middle East and commodity price-related reserve revisions. The increase was partly offset by reserve additions in the Lower 48. Impairments increased 162 percent in 2015. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 57 percent in 2015, mainly due to lower production taxes from reduced commodity prices in the Lower 48, Alaska and Asia Pacific and Middle East. Interest and debt expense increased 42 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased average debt levels in 2015. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 2014 vs. 2013 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 3 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher crude oil and bitumen volumes and higher natural gas prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 14 percent in 2014, primarily as a result of higher earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher bitumen volumes and prices. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from APLNG, mostly as a result of higher operating expenses and DD&A. Gain on dispositions decreased $1,144 million in 2014. Gains realized in 2014 mostly resulted from the disposition of certain properties in western Canada. For additional information on gains realized in prior years, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Production and operating expenses increased 23 percent in 2014, largely due to the $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement. Higher drilling and maintenance activity, mostly in the Lower 48, Australia, Alaska and Europe, in addition to the absence of the 2013 benefit of a $142 million accrual reduction related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), also contributed to the increase. These increases were partly offset by the absence of a $155 million charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay. For additional information on the Freeport LNG transaction, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SG&A expenses decreased 14 percent in 2014, mainly due to the absence of pension settlement expenses. Exploration expenses increased 66 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of higher impairments of undeveloped leasehold costs, primarily in the Lower 48 and Canada, and higher dry hole costs, mostly associated with the Gulf of Mexico and Angola. For additional information on the leasehold impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A increased 12 percent in 2014. This increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the United Kingdom and the Lower 48, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada associated with year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes. Impairments increased 62 percent in 2014. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Taxes other than income taxes decreased 28 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower production taxes, which resulted from higher capital spending, lower crude oil prices and lower production volumes in Alaska. Interest and debt expense increased 6 percent in 2014, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects, partly offset by lower interest expense from lower average debt levels and a $28 million benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 44 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2015 2014 2013 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD)* 605 595 581 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 156 159 156 Bitumen (MBD) 151 129 109 Natural gas (MMCFD)** 4,060 3,943 3,939 Total Production (MBOED)*** 1,589 1,540 1,502 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 48.26 92.80 103.32 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 17.79 38.99 41.42 Bitumen (per barrel) 18.72 55.13 53.27 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 3.96 6.57 6.11 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 1,127 879 789 Leasehold impairment 1,924 562 175 Dry holes 1,141 604 268 $ 4,192 2,045 1,232 Excludes discontinued operations. *Thousands of barrels per day. **Millions of cubic feet per day.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2015, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Qatar. Total production from continuing operations, including Libya, increased 3 percent in 2015. The increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Adjusted for downtime and dispositions of 13 MBOED, our production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased by 70 MBOED, or 5 percent, compared with 2014. Full-year 2015 production from assets sold or under agreement was 64 MBOED. In 2014, average production from continuing operations increased 3 percent compared with 2013, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. The increase in total average production in 2014 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, mainly from tight oil plays in the Lower 48 and the ramp up of production from Jasmine in the United Kingdom and Christina Lake in Canada, and increased drilling programs, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline, higher planned downtime, shut-in Libya production due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and unfavorable market impacts. Adjusted for Libya, production from continuing operations increased by 60 MBOED, or 4 percent, compared with 2013. 45 Table of Contents Alaska 2015 2014 2013 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 4 2,041 2,274 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 158 162 178 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 13 13 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) 42 49 43 Total Production (MBOED) 178 183 200 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 51.61 97.68 107.83 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.33 5.42 4.35 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2015, Alaska contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2015 vs. 2014 Alaska reported earnings of $4 million in 2015, compared with earnings of $2,041 million in 2014, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a $368 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the impairment of our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest. The earnings decrease was partly offset by reduced production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices. Average production decreased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by lower planned downtime activity and new production from the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas. 2014 vs. 2013 Alaska earnings decreased 10 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings. The decrease was largely due to lower crude oil prices and volumes; the absence of a $97 million after-tax benefit associated with a FERC ruling in 2013, more fully described below; higher operating expenses; and a $36 million after-tax impairment related to a cancelled project. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from higher 2014 capital spending and lower crude oil prices and volumes. Higher LNG sales volumes and prices also partially offset the decrease in 2014 earnings. In 2012, the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013, FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. As a result, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. Average production decreased 9 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly as a result of normal field decline and higher planned maintenance, partly offset by lower unplanned downtime. 46 Table of Contents Lower 48 2015 2014 2013 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (1,932) (22) 754 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 206 188 152 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 94 97 91 Natural gas (MMCFD) 1,472 1,491 1,490 Total Production (MBOED) 545 533 491 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 42.62 84.18 93.79 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 14.01 30.74 31.48 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.43 4.29 3.50 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2015, the Lower 48 contributed 33 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our natural gas production. 2015 vs. 2014 Lower 48 reported a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015, compared with a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: • Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased crude oil production. • Higher exploration expenses ¡ Increased impairment expense in 2015, including after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the Gila Prospect, where we ceased further activity. ¡ A $246 million charge to exploration expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco. ¡ Higher dry hole costs, including $111 million associated with two wells in the Gila Prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of a $545 million after-tax charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement in 2014; a $368 million after-tax gain from the disposition of certain properties in South Texas, East Texas and Northern Louisiana; higher volumes; lower production taxes; and the absence of a $151 million after-tax impairment charge resulting from reduced volume forecasts on proved properties and the associated undeveloped leasehold costs. Our average realized prices in the Lower 48 have historically correlated with WTI prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our Lower 48 crude differential versus WTI began to widen. Our 2015 average realized crude oil price of $42.62 per barrel was 13 percent less than WTI of $48.72 per barrel. The differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast, Bakken and the Permian Basin, and may remain relatively wide in the near-term. Total average production increased 2 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while average crude oil production increased 10 percent across the same period. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, partially offset by normal field decline. 47 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 The Lower 48 reported a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014, compared with earnings of $754 million after-tax in 2013. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to: • Higher operating expenses, which included the $545 million after-tax charge to earnings due to the Freeport LNG termination agreement. • Lower crude oil prices. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil production. • Higher impairments. Earnings in 2014 were impacted by impairments of approximately $290 million after-tax. Property impairments were not material in 2013. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Higher dry hole costs. Dry hole costs in 2014 were approximately $180 million after-tax, primarily for the nonoperated Coronado wildcat and appraisal wells, the Shenandoah appraisal well and the Deep Nansen wildcat well, all located in the Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole costs in 2013 were approximately $130 million after-tax and mainly consisted of the Ardennes and Thorn wells, also located in the Gulf of Mexico. • An $83 million after-tax loss recognized upon the release of underutilized transportation and storage capacity at rates below our contractual rates. These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas prices and a benefit to earnings of approximately $150 million after-tax from marketing third-party natural gas volumes. Total average production in the Lower 48 increased 9 percent in 2014, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and improved drilling and well performance, partially offset by normal field decline. 48 Table of Contents Canada 2015 2014 2013 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (1,044) 940 718 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 12 13 13 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 26 23 25 Bitumen (MBD) 13 12 13 Consolidated operations Equity affiliates 138 117 96 Total bitumen 151 129 109 Natural gas (MMCFD) 715 711 775 Total Production (MBOED) 308 284 276 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 39.52 77.87 79.73 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 17.02 46.23 47.19 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) 20.13 60.03 55.25 Consolidated operations Equity affiliates 18.58 54.62 53.00 Total bitumen 18.72 55.13 53.27 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 1.91 4.13 2.92 Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2015, Canada contributed 21 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our worldwide natural gas production. 2015 vs. 2014 Canada operations reported a loss of $1,044 million in 2015, a reduction of $1,984 million compared with 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: • Lower bitumen and natural gas prices. • Higher exploration expenses ¡ Higher dry hole costs, including an after-tax charge of $185 million associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties. ¡ An after-tax impairment charge of $75 million for undeveloped leasehold in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas. • A 2 percent increase in Alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes. • A $103 million net after-tax loss realized on the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. The earnings decrease was partly offset by higher bitumen production volumes; lower operating expenses and DD&A, both primarily from favorable foreign currency impacts; and the absence of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties in 2014. Total average production increased 8 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same periods. The increases in total production were mainly attributable to strong well performance in western Canada, lower royalty impacts, strong plant performance at Foster Creek 49 Table of Contents and Christina Lake and the continued ramp-up of production from Foster Creek Phase F. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and increased unplanned downtime, including the precautionary shut down of Foster Creek for nearby forest fires in the second quarter of 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 Canada earnings increased 31 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher natural gas and bitumen prices, lower DD&A from western Canada and higher bitumen volumes. The lower DD&A mainly resulted from lower unit-of-production rates related to year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes. Earnings in 2014 also included a $47 million tax benefit resulting from a favorable tax settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, mainly as a result of the $461 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold in 2013, as well as the 2013 recognition of a $224 million tax benefit, related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties. Lower natural gas volumes also partially offset the increase in 2014 earnings. In addition, earnings in 2014 benefitted from lower impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $138 million after-tax and consisted primarily of the $109 million after-tax impairment of unproved properties associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, and for additional information on impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total average production increased 3 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, while bitumen production increased 18 percent over the same period. The continued ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phase E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance were partly offset by normal field decline and higher royalty impacts.

In 2015, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production. 50 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations decreased 50 percent in 2015. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Earnings further decreased due to higher property impairments in the U.K., given lower natural gas prices and increases to asset retirement obligations. The earnings decrease was partly offset by a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the U.K. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015, and an after-tax gain of $49 million realized on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled). For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production decreased 5 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in production was mostly due to normal field decline and lower volumes from Libya, partly offset by the new production from the Greater Britannia Area, the J-Area and the Greater Ekofisk Area, as well as improved well performance in Norway. The Es Sider Terminal in Libya remained shut in throughout 2015. The 2016 operating and drilling activity in Libya is uncertain as a result of the ongoing civil unrest. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for Europe and North Africa decreased 37 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was primarily due to higher DD&A, which mainly resulted from increased production volumes from Jasmine, lower crude oil and natural gas prices, higher taxes, higher impairments, and lower volumes from Libya. Impairments in 2014 were $192 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2013 of $118 million after-tax. Lower gains from asset dispositions, mostly due to the absence of the $83 million after-tax gain on the disposition of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013, also contributed to the decrease in 2014 earnings. These decreases were partly offset by higher volumes, primarily in the U.K., and a $48 million after-tax benefit from a pension-related settlement. For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production was flat in 2014 compared with 2013, as the continued ramp-up of production from Jasmine, the Rivers Acid Plant in the East Irish Sea and Ekofisk South, improved drilling and well performance in Norway and lower planned downtime, were equally offset by normal field decline and the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya. 51 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2015 2014 2013 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (406) 3,008 3,591 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 91 79 80 Equity affiliates 14 15 15 Total crude oil 105 94 95 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 9 10 12 Equity affiliates 7 8 7 Total natural gas liquids 16 18 19 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 717 723 709 Equity affiliates 638 505 481 Total natural gas 1,355 1,228 1,190 Total Production (MBOED) 347 317 312 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 49.70 95.32 104.78 Equity affiliates 53.12 99.01 105.44 Total crude oil 50.16 95.92 104.88 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 37.78 69.36 73.82 Equity affiliates 35.79 67.20 73.31 Total natural gas liquids 36.88 68.46 73.63 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 6.23 9.80 10.61 Equity affiliates 4.83 9.79 8.98 Total natural gas 5.58 9.80 9.95 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Brunei. During 2015, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 33 percent of our natural gas production. 2015 vs. 2014 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a loss of $406 million in 2015, compared with income of $3,008 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower prices across all commodities. Earnings in 2015 were further decreased by a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment, higher DD&A expense from increased volumes, primarily in Malaysia, and a $41 million after-tax charge for the impairment of our relinquished Palangkaraya PSC. The earnings decrease was partially offset by lower production taxes, increased volumes, as well as lower feedstock costs and reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility. 52 Table of Contents See the “APLNG” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the impairment of our APLNG investment included within the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. Average production increased 9 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The production increase was mainly attributable to new production from Gumusut, in Malaysia, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2014; the ramp-up of APLNG production due to additional gas processing facilities online; and infill drilling in China. Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline. 2014 vs. 2013 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings decreased 16 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was largely due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices; higher operating expenses, mostly as a result of major planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility in Australia; lower equity earnings, mainly due to increased activity at APLNG in preparation for startup in 2015; and lower sales volumes, primarily crude oil and LNG. These decreases were partially offset by higher LNG prices, higher natural gas volumes and lower taxes. The 2014 benefits from the absence of the $116 million after-tax charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay and a $30 million after-tax legal settlement in 2014 were offset by the absence of a $146 million after-tax insurance settlement received in 2013, also associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. Average production increased 2 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. Increased production, mainly from Indonesia, China and Malaysia, was largely offset by normal field decline and major planned maintenance at Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG.

In 2015, Other International contributed less than 1 percent of our worldwide liquids production. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our 50 percent interest in the Polar Lights Company. 2015 vs. 2014 Other International operations reported a loss of $593 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $100 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to after-tax charges of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our Angola Block 36, Angola Block 37 and Poland leasehold, respectively. Earnings were also reduced due to increased dry hole expenses for the Omosi-1 and Vali-1 wells in Angola and the absence of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of 53 Table of Contents a contingent liability. The reduction in earnings was partly offset by the absence of the $136 million after-tax charge in 2014 for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola; and a $53 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our interest in the Polar Lights Company. For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production was flat in 2015 compared with 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 Other International operations reported a loss of $100 million in 2014, compared with earnings of $223 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the lower gains from asset dispositions, mainly from the absence of the $288 million after-tax gain recognized on the 2013 disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago and higher dry hole expenses, mostly due to the $136 million after-tax charge for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola. These reductions were partially offset by the recognition of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability. Average production was flat in 2014 compared with 2013. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2015 2014 2013 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (518) (502) (530) Corporate general and administrative expenses (246) (194) (213) Technology 122 (93) (6) Other (167) (85) (71) $ (809) (874) (820) 2015 vs. 2014 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily as a result of lower capitalized interest on projects completed or sold and increased debt. The 2015 net interest expense increase was largely offset by a $148 million net tax benefit for electing the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States for prior years. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 27 percent in 2015, mainly due to $143 million in after-tax pension settlement expense, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands, unconventional reservoirs, LNG, and subsurface, arctic and deepwater technologies, with an underlying commitment to environmental responsibility. Earnings from Technology were $122 million in 2015, compared with losses of $93 million in 2014. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher licensing revenues. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. “Other” expenses increased by $82 million in 2015, mainly due to $142 million after-tax in restructuring charges and foreign currency translation impacts, partially offset by lower environmental expenses. 54 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Net interest decreased 5 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of a $93 million tax benefit associated with the election of the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States, as well as a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. These improvements were largely offset by lower capitalized interest on projects sold or completed. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense, partly offset by higher benefit-related expenses. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax. We did not incur pension settlement expense in 2014. Losses from Technology were $93 million in 2014, compared with losses of $6 million in 2013. The reduction in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues and higher research and development expenses. 55 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2015 2014 2013 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 7,572 16,412 15,856 Net cash provided by discontinued operations - 157 285 Cash and cash equivalents 2,368 5,062 6,246 Short-term debt 1,427 182 589 Total debt 24,880 22,565 21,662 Total equity 40,082 52,273 52,492 Percent of total debt to capital* 38 % 30 29 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 7 % 5 8 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. **Includes effect of interest rate swaps in 2013. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2015 we received $1,952 million in proceeds from asset sales and issued $2,498 million of new fixed and floating rate notes. The primary uses of our available cash were $10,050 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $3,664 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $103 million to repay debt. During 2015, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,694 million, to $2,368 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2015, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $7,572 million, a 54 percent decrease from 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices across all commodities and the absence of the $1.3 billion distribution from FCCL in the first quarter of 2014, partly offset by year-over-year production growth. The distribution from FCCL resulted from our $2.8 billion prepayment of the remaining joint venture acquisition obligation in 2013, which substantially increased the financial flexibility of our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. We do not expect this individually significant distribution to recur in the future under current economic conditions. During 2014, cash provided by continuing operations was $16,412 million, compared with $15,856 million in 2013. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2015 production averaged 1,589 MBOED. We expect 2016 production to be flat with 2015 production of 1,525 MBOED, which excludes 64 MBOED for the full-year impact of completed dispositions. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas 56 Table of Contents price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2015 was negative 19 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 10 percent of 2015 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2015, our reserve replacement was 96 percent (including 54 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 117 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. In the event we undertake any cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. For additional information about our 2016 capital budget, see the “2016 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2015, revisions decreased reserves, while in 2014 and 2013, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities Proceeds from asset sales in 2015 were $2.0 billion, primarily from the sales of certain western Canadian properties; producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana and in South Texas; a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas; and our 50 percent equity method investment in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights Company. This compares with proceeds of $1.6 billion in 2014, primarily from the sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, after customary adjustments, inclusive of deposits previously received. For additional information, see Note 3—Discontinued Operations, and Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling non-core assets. For additional information regarding marketing activities, see the “Outlook” section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis. In May 2015, we liquidated certain deferred compensation investments for proceeds of $267 million, which is included in the “Other” line within “Cash Flows From Investing Activities” on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We do not expect further material liquidations associated with deferred compensation investments. For additional information, see Note 15—Fair Value Measurement, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows from investing activities in 2014 were impacted by the $454 million receipt of the Freeport LNG loan repayment. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities During 2015, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.0 billion expiring in June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, for the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. 57 Table of Contents Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $900 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no direct borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. Under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper programs, $803 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2015, compared with $860 million at December 31, 2014. Since we had $803 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.2 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015. In August 2015, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to “A2” from “A1”, with a stable outlook. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s placed our long-term and short-term corporate credit ratings on CreditWatch with Negative Implications. Due to the recent significant decline in commodity prices and the expectation these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies have indicated they will be conducting a review of the oil and gas industry. During the first quarter of 2016, the credit ratings for several companies in the oil and gas industry were downgraded, and we expect further downgrades may broadly impact the industry during the first half of 2016. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a further downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had direct bank letters of credit of $340 million and $802 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2015, was $24.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the balance at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the May 2015 issuance of $2.5 billion in new fixed and floating rate notes. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2015, increased $1.2 billion compared with 58 Table of Contents December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. We expect to pursue financing options in 2016 to provide additional capital to finance our operations and to partially refinance some of our long-term borrowings, which may include offerings of additional notes from time to time depending on market conditions. For more information, see Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. In October 2015, we announced a dividend of 74 cents per share. The dividend was paid December 1, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 19, 2015. On February 4, 2016, we announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of 74 cents per share. We believe this effort will allow us to preserve our balance sheet strength and provide financial flexibility through the current downturn. The dividend will be paid March 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing operations as of December 31, 2015: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years2–3 Years4–5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 24,062 1,365 2,841 4,484 15,372 Capital lease obligations (b) 818 62 99 106 551 Total debt 24,880 1,427 2,940 4,590 15,923 Interest on debt and other obligations 15,120 1,185 2,209 1,792 9,934 Operating lease obligations (c) 2,157 671 575 530 381 Purchase obligations (d) 12,359 5,043 2,040 1,324 3,952 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,999 414 892 693 - Asset retirement obligations (f) 9,911 553 1,101 1,006 7,251 Accrued environmental costs (g) 258 39 51 35 133 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 46 46 (h) (h) (h) Total $ 66,730 9,378 9,808 9,970 37,574 (a) Includes $284 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. 59 Table of Contents (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $3,986 million. Purchase obligations of $6,664 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2016 through 2020. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2020, see Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $413 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Working capital changes associated with investing activities increased cash used in investing activities by $968 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with a decrease of $180 million for the corresponding period of 2014, and an increase of $55 million for the corresponding period of 2013. The increase in cash used in investing activities as of December 31, 2015, is attributable to reduced capital accruals, as compared with December 31, 2014, from lower activity levels in 2015, primarily in the Lower 48 and Canada. 60 Table of Contents Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, totaled $42.7 billion. The 2015 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Permian Basin. • Major project expenditures associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Oil sands development, notably at Surmont 2, and ongoing liquids-rich plays in Canada. • Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Greater Prudhoe Area and the Western North Slope. • In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Aasta Hansteen, Clair Ridge, Jasmine and Greater Britannia areas, and exploration and appraisal activities in the Jasmine and Greater Clair areas. • Exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Continued development in Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Timor-Leste and offshore Australia, and exploration and appraisal activity in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and offshore Australia. • Exploration activities in Angola and Senegal. 2016 CAPITAL BUDGET In anticipation of ongoing weak commodity prices in 2016, our capital budget was reduced in February 2016 from the previously announced $7.7 billion to $6.4 billion, a decrease of 37 percent compared with 2015 capital expenditures of $10.1 billion. The reduction in capital relative to 2015 primarily reflects lower major project spending, deflation capture, deferral of activity and efficiency improvements. We are planning to allocate approximately: • 34 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford and Bakken, as well as development drilling in Canada, Alaska, the Greater Ekofisk Area, and in legacy assets within Asia Pacific and Middle East. • 31 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on startup of APLNG Train 2, as well as major projects in Alaska, Europe, Malaysia and China. • 18 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal activity. These funds will primarily target the Gulf of Mexico, Senegal, Nova Scotia, and Alaska. • 17 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. 61 Table of Contents Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the 62 Table of Contents application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2015, there were 14 sites around the United States in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 63 Table of Contents Expensed environmental costs were $485 million in 2015 and are expected to be about $478 million per year in 2016 and 2017. Capitalized environmental costs were $303 million in 2015 and are expected to be about $250 million per year in 2016 and 2017. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2015, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $258 million, compared with $344 million at December 31, 2014, for remediation activities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2015 was approximately $0.4 million (net share pre-tax). • In Canada during 2015, the Alberta government amended the regulations of the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulations now require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. The reduction is increasing from the current 12 percent in 2015, to 15 percent in 2016 and to 20 percent in 2017. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these regulations in 2015 was approximately $4.7 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. 64 Table of Contents • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The current U.S. administration has established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2015 was approximately $31 million (net share pre-tax). • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. 65 Table of Contents The company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2014, the company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 900,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $8 to $35 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income. 66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2015, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $515 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $191 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 74 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2016 would increase by approximately $7 million. At year-end 2015, the remaining $4,501 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 12 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2016. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 67 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2015, total suspended well costs were $1,260 million, compared with $1,299 million at year-end 2014. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. 68 Table of Contents Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2015, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $58 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2015 was approximately $8.7 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.6 billion BOE at the end of 2014 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2015. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, pre-tax DD&A in 2015 would have increased by an estimated $960 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. 69 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,100 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $100 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of 70 Table of Contents unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingences, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” 71 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth in 2016 and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. • The impact of recent, significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Inability to maintain reserves replacement rates consistent with prior periods, whether as a result of the recent, significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations, use of competing energy sources or the development of alternative energy sources. 72 Table of Contents • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Volatility in the commodity futures markets. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Delays in, or our inability to, execute asset dispositions. • Inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us. • Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. 73 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was also immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 74 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Fixed Average Floating Average Rate Interest Rate Interest Expected Maturity Date Maturity Rate Maturity Rate Year-End 2015 2016 $ 1,250 5.63 % $ 108 0.35 % 2017 1,024 1.03 - - 2018 1,547 3.68 250 0.69 2019 2,250 5.75 695 0.35 2020 1,500 4.73 - - Remaining years 14,371 5.72 783 0.81 Total $ 21,942 $ 1,836 Fair value $ 22,949 $ 1,836 Year-End 2014 2015 $ - - % $ 107 0.18 % 2016 1,273 5.52 - - 2017 1,001 1.06 - - 2018 797 5.74 - - 2019 2,250 5.75 753 0.18 Remaining years 14,871 5.81 283 0.04 Total $ 20,192 $ 1,143 Fair value $ 24,048 $ 1,143 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2015, or 2014, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows: 75 Table of Contents In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2015 2014 2015 2014 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 200 - (3 ) - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD - 7 - (1 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD 147 - (2 ) - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD - 44 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD 20 - 2 - Buy British pound, sell Canadian dollar GBP 564 - 44 - Buy British pound, sell euro GBP 3 20 (1 ) 1 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and British pound (GBP). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

1163165,COP,CONOCOPHILLIPS,2017,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes, and supplemental oil and gas disclosures included elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the company’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 72. Due to discontinued operations reporting, we believe income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips’ earnings than overall net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. For additional information, see Note 3—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 17 countries. Our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich North American unconventional assets and oil sands assets in Canada; lower-risk conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 13,300 people worldwide and had total assets of $90 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Overview The energy landscape remained challenged throughout 2016. Global production oversupply caused continued weakness in commodity prices in 2016 following a year of weak prices in 2015. Ongoing uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a price recovery, coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry, caused us to take actions early in the year to mitigate the impacts of possible prolonged weak prices. We reduced our quarterly dividend by 66 percent, to $0.25 per share, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, obtained a $1.6 billion three-year term loan, reduced capital expenditures and production and operating expenses, and further streamlined our portfolio. Our capital expenditures in 2016 were $4.9 billion, a 52 percent reduction compared with 2015 and a 72 percent reduction compared with 2014. Production and operating expenses in 2016 were $5.7 billion, down 19 percent compared with 2015 and down 36 percent compared with 2014. We also progressed our efforts to high-grade our portfolio. In 2016, we generated $1.3 billion from the disposition of certain non-core assets in our portfolio, including the offshore South Natuna Sea Block B in Indonesia and ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal. The full-year 2016 production impact of completed dispositions was 27 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). 34 Table of Contents During 2016, we expanded our value proposition to position the company for long-term success in light of our view that commodity prices, specifically oil prices, are likely to remain lower and be more volatile in the future. Our value proposition principles, namely to maintain a strong balance sheet, grow our dividend and pursue disciplined growth, remain essentially unchanged. However, we took steps to improve our competitiveness and resilience by establishing clear priorities for allocating future cash flows. In order, these priorities are: invest capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes and pays our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; reduce debt to a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade rating through price cycles; repurchase shares; and invest capital to grow absolute production. We outlined a 2017 to 2019 operating plan that achieves these priorities at Brent prices at or above $50 per barrel with asset sales of $5 billion to $8 billion. We believe we have taken prudent actions to position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility, while accomplishing significant milestones in a challenged business environment throughout 2016. Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2016 included the following: • Achieved full-year production excluding Libya of 1,567 MBOED; 3 percent production growth adjusted for downtime and dispositions. • Capital expenditures of $4.9 billion, a more than 50 percent reduction compared with 2015. • Reduced production and operating expenses by 19 percent year over year. • Achieved project startups at APLNG Train 2 in Australia, Foster Creek Phase G and Christina Lake Phase F in Canada, Alder in Europe, Malikai in Malaysia, and Bohai wellhead platform J in China. • Significant discovery at Willow prospect in Alaska. • Generated proceeds of $1.3 billion from asset dispositions. • Announced preliminary year-end proved reserves of 6.4 billion BOE. • Initiated $3 billion share buyback program in mid-November. Business Environment Global oil market conditions in 2016 were challenging as the excess of supply relative to global demand led to another year of global inventory builds. Global oil prices experienced elevated levels of volatility throughout 2016 with first quarter Brent crude oil prices reaching a 10-year quarterly average low of $33.89 per barrel. Prices recovered slightly in the second and third quarters of 2016 as production growth slowed while demand continued to increase. In the fourth quarter, prices continued to trend higher, with Brent crude oil averaging $49.46 per barrel, as OPEC members and key non-OPEC producers agreed to cut production in 2017. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Among other dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices are global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. North America’s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, primarily due to advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production, successful exploration and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial and operational priorities that underpin our value proposition. 35 Table of Contents Financial Priorities The financial priorities we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include: • Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe financial strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. In early 2016, ongoing uncertainty around the timing of a price recovery, coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry, caused us to take actions to preserve our balance sheet strength and mitigate the impacts of possible weak prices in 2016 and 2017. During the first quarter of 2016, we reduced our quarterly dividend and issued additional debt to secure liquidity. Realized commodity prices improved subsequent to the first quarter of 2016, and we paid down approximately $2.3 billion of debt during the second half of the year. In November 2016, we announced our plan to reduce debt to $20 billion by year-end 2019. We expect to retire outstanding debt as it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our term loan, which is due in 2019. • Return capital to shareholders. In 2016, we paid dividends on our common stock of $1.3 billion. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through the price cycles. As a result, we have set a priority to increase our dividend rate annually and purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock over the next three years. We began repurchasing shares in November 2016, and in January 2017, we announced a 6 percent increase to our quarterly dividend, from $0.25 per share to $0.265 per share. • Focus on financial returns. This is a core aspect of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by controlling our costs, high-grading our portfolio, shifting our production mix, and exercising capital discipline. Operational Priorities The operational priorities we must manage well to be successful include: • Maintain capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. Given our view of greater price volatility, we have shifted our capital allocation to focus on value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply unconventional programs in our resource base. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend. Additional allocations of capital toward absolute growth will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial priorities. We use a disciplined approach, focused on value maximization, to set our capital plans. In November 2016, we announced a 2017 capital budget of $5 billion. • Optimize our portfolio. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets which strategically fit our development plans. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced plans to reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program. Subsequently, in 2016, we sold our interests in several exploration areas, including offshore Senegal, and terminated our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. Additionally, during the year, we sold our 40 percent working interest in the offshore South Natuna Sea Block B Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in Indonesia and our 30 percent interest in an exploration license offshore Newfoundland. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds from non-core asset dispositions in 2016. 36 Table of Contents In November 2016, we announced our plan to divest between $5 billion and $8 billion of assets, primarily associated with North American natural gas, over the next two years. Proceeds from the sale of assets will be directed toward the achievement of our financial priorities. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives. • Maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2016 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and operational performance. • Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in two ways: ¡ Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. ¡ Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Additionally, as we continue cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. Low commodity prices and reduced capital expenditures in 2016 adversely affected our reported year-end proved reserves. In 2016, our reserve replacement was negative 194 percent. In the five years ended December 31, 2016, our reserve replacement was 35 percent. We expect our proved reserves to increase if prices rise. Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. • Develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. 37 Table of Contents Other Factors Affecting Profitability Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas, the prices of which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Brent crude oil prices averaged $49.46 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 13 percent compared with $43.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices increased 17 percent from $42.10 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $49.18 per barrel in the same period of 2016. Despite the fourth quarter increase, crude oil prices were under pressure throughout 2016 due to a continued global production increase that outpaced demand growth, leading to a large observed rise in global inventory. The average Brent crude oil price decreased 17 percent, from $52.46 per barrel in 2015 to $43.69 per barrel in 2016. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $2.98 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 31 percent compared with $2.27 per MMBTU in the fourth quarter of 2015. Natural gas prices increased in the fourth quarter due to growth in demand, coupled with declining production. On average, Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased 8 percent from $2.67 per MMBTU in 2015 to $2.46 per MMBTU in 2016, mainly due to strong production levels and a warmer-than expected winter reducing demand below expectations. In 2016, U.S. underground gas storage inventories reached their highest levels in five years. Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $21.82 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 33 percent compared with $16.42 per barrel in the same quarter of 2015. Similar to natural gas and crude oil, our natural gas liquids prices also declined on average in 2016. Our average realized natural gas liquids prices decreased 6 percent, from $17.79 per barrel in 2015 to $16.68 per barrel in 2016, as the expansion in tight oil production boosted supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in continued downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. 38 Table of Contents Declining global crude oil prices resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price experiencing a 17 percent decline, from $35.21 per barrel in 2015 to $29.36 per barrel in 2016. Consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a decrease relative to 2015 price levels. Our realized bitumen price was $15.27 per barrel in 2016, a decrease of 18 percent compared with $18.72 per barrel in the same period of 2015. Our worldwide annual average realized price was $28.35 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2016, a decrease of 17 percent compared with $34.34 per BOE in 2015. The reduction in the prices reflects lower average realized prices across all commodities. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible. • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in a capital-intensive industry. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. In 2016, we recorded before-tax impairments of $139 million for proved properties and $466 million for unproved properties. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For additional information on our impairments in 2016, 2015 and 2014, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were suspended or significantly curtailed from July 2013 to October 2016 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. In 2016, the United Kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K. corporate tax rate by 10 percent. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 39 Table of Contents Outlook Full-year 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,570 MBOED. This results in flat to 2 percent growth compared with full-year 2016 production of 1,540 MBOED when adjusted for 2016 dispositions of 27 MBOED. First-quarter 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,580 MBOED. Production guidance for 2017 excludes Libya and the impact of future dispositions. Marketing Activities In line with our strategic objectives, we are currently marketing certain non-core assets primarily associated with North American natural gas. We expect to generate $5 billion to $8 billion in proceeds over the next two years from asset sales. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Alaska $ 319 4 2,041 Lower 48 (2,257 ) (1,932 ) (22 ) Canada (935 ) (1,044 ) 940 Europe and North Africa 394 409 814 Asia Pacific and Middle East 265 (406 ) 3,008 Other International (16 ) (593 ) (100 ) Corporate and Other (1,329 ) (809 ) (874 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (3,559 ) (4,371 ) 5,807 2016 vs. 2015 Losses for ConocoPhillips decreased 19 percent in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to: • Lower exploration expenses. Exploration expenses decreased mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense and dry hole costs. • Lower proved property and equity investment impairments, including the absence of a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG) in 2015. • Lower production and operating expenses. • A $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in September 2016 and effective January 1, 2016. • The absence of a $129 million deferred tax charge from increased corporate tax rates in Canada in 2015. The decrease in losses was partly offset by: • Lower commodity prices. • The absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate in 2015. • Lower crude oil, natural gas liquids, and gas sales volumes. • Lower equity earnings, primarily driven by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, as well as a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for APLNG to U.S. dollar. • Higher interest and debt expense. • Lower gain on dispositions, mainly due to the absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in our Lower 48 segment. 41 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 175 percent in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower commodity prices. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by: • Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. • Higher exploration expenses. Exploration expenses increased mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. The increase included after-tax unproved property impairments of $368 million for our Alaska Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest, $310 million for our Angola Block 36 and 37 PSCs, $154 million for multiple Gulf of Mexico leases, and $100 million for various Gila Prospect blocks. Additional after-tax dry hole costs and other expenses resulted from a $185 million charge for several properties in Canada, $140 million for two dry holes in Angola, $111 million for a dry hole in the Gila Prospect in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and $246 million related to the termination of our drilling contract with Ensco. • Higher DD&A, mainly from increased production and commodity price-driven reserve revisions. • Higher restructuring charges and pension settlement expense. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by higher sales volumes, lower production taxes due to reduced commodity prices, lower operating expenses, a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, the absence of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement, gain on sale of assets, and higher licensing revenue. Income Statement Analysis 2016 vs. 2015 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. Additionally, sales and other operating revenues decreased due to lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes, mainly from dispositions and field decline, partly offset by increased bitumen sales volumes. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 92 percent in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower commodity prices, increased DD&A mainly from Trains 1 and 2 being placed in service at APLNG, and a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax functional currency change. The decrease in earnings was partly offset by higher sales volumes at APLNG and FCCL Partnership, as well as lower production taxes at Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3). Gain on dispositions decreased 39 percent in 2016. The decrease resulted from the absence of a $583 million before-tax gain in 2015 from the sales of producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, South Texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas, as well as a $26 million before-tax loss on the sale of our interest in the Block B PSC in Indonesia in 2016. The decrease was partly offset by the absence of a $149 million before-tax loss on the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada in the fourth quarter of 2015; and gains on the 2016 dispositions of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interests in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field, and non-core assets in the Lower 48. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents Other income increased 104 percent in 2016, mainly due to a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties and active leases from the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other income was further increased $76 million before-tax for a damage claim settlement in our Lower 48 segment. Purchased commodities decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses decreased 19 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower operating expense activity, reduced headcount and dispositions of non-core assets, as well as favorable foreign currency impacts. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 24 percent in 2016, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower headcount and reduced activity. The decrease was partly offset by increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs. Exploration expenses decreased 54 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs, and other exploration expenses. Leasehold impairment expense was reduced, mainly due to the absence of 2015 before-tax charges of $575 million for our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest; $493 million for Angola Blocks 36 and 37; and $447 million for certain Gulf of Mexico leases, partly offset by 2016 impairments of our Melmar, Gibson, Tiber and other Gulf of Mexico leaseholds. Dry hole costs were reduced due to the absence of before-tax charges of $1,141 million in 2015, mainly from wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Horn River and Northwest Territories in Canada, Angola Blocks 36 and 37, and Malaysia. The reduction in costs was partly offset by before-tax charges in 2016, including $434 million from several wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and $256 million for two wells in Nova Scotia. Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $335 million before-tax charge in 2015 related to the termination of our Ensco Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, partly offset by before-tax rig cancellation charges and third-party costs of $146 million for our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract in 2016. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments decreased 94 percent in 2016. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 18 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower production taxes, mainly in our Alaska and Lower 48 segments, given reduced commodity prices and the absence of the impact of a transportation cost ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the fourth quarter of 2015 in Alaska. Taxes other than income taxes were additionally decreased due to lower property taxes in 2016 in our Alaska and Lower 48 segments. Interest and debt expense increased 35 percent in 2016, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased debt. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate. 43 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 44 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. Lower prices were partly offset by higher crude oil and LNG sales volumes. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 74 percent in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from FCCL and QG3, given lower commodity prices, partly offset by higher volumes and lower operational costs. Gain on dispositions increased by $493 million in 2015. The increase resulted from a $583 million gain from the sales of producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, South Texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas. Gains realized were partly offset by a net loss from the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 66 percent in 2015, mainly due to the absence of 2014 income related to the resolution of a contingent liability in the Other International segment and a legal arbitration settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. Purchased commodities decreased 44 percent in 2015, largely as a result of lower natural gas prices and the absence of a $130 million loss in the Lower 48 related to transportation and storage capacity agreements recognized in 2014. Production and operating expenses decreased 21 percent in 2015, largely due to lower operating expense activity, including reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility, favorable foreign exchange-related impacts, and the absence of an $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement in 2014. The decrease in expense was partially offset by restructuring expenses of $206 million in 2015. SG&A expenses increased 30 percent in 2015, primarily due to $407 million in restructuring and pension settlement expenses, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs. Exploration expenses increased 105 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, primarily in Alaska, Angola and the Lower 48. Higher dry hole and other exploration costs, including a $253 million before-tax expense for wells charged to dry hole in Canada, a $383 million expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, and a $176 million charge for two wells charged to dry hole in the Gila prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, also contributed to the increase in exploration expenses. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A increased 9 percent in 2015. The increase was mainly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48 and Asia Pacific and Middle East and commodity price-related reserve revisions, partly offset by reserve additions in the Lower 48. Impairments increased 162 percent in 2015. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 57 percent in 2015, mainly due to lower production taxes from reduced commodity prices in the Lower 48, Alaska and Asia Pacific and Middle East. Interest and debt expense increased 42 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased average debt levels in 2015. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate. 44 Table of Contents Summary Operating Statistics 2016 2015 2014 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD)* 598 605 595 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 145 156 159 Bitumen (MBD) 183 151 129 Natural gas (MMCFD)** 3,857 4,060 3,943 Total Production (MBOED)*** 1,569 1,589 1,540 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 40.86 48.26 92.80 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 16.68 17.79 38.99 Bitumen (per barrel) 15.27 18.72 55.13 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 3.00 3.96 6.57 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical, lease rental, and other $ 731 1,127 879 Leasehold impairment 466 1,924 562 Dry holes 718 1,141 604 $ 1,915 4,192 2,045 Excludes discontinued operations. * Thousands of barrels per day. ** Millions of cubic feet per day.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2016, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. Total production, including Libya, of 1,569 MBOED decreased 1 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from normal field decline and the loss of 72 MBOED mainly attributable to the 2015 dispositions of several non-core assets in the Lower 48, western Canada and the sale of our interest in the Polar Lights Company in Russia. The decrease in production was partly offset by additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; APLNG in Australia; the Western North Slope in Alaska; the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia; and the Greater Ekofisk Area in Norway. Improved drilling and well performance in Canada, Norway, the Lower 48, and China, as well as lower unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 also partly offset the decrease in production. Adjusted for downtime and dispositions of 66 MBOED, our production, excluding Libya, increased by 44 MBOED, or 3 percent, compared with 2015. Assets sold in 2016 produced 27 MBOED and 36 MBOED in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, average production from continuing operations, including Libya, increased 3 percent compared with 2014, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. The increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Adjusted for downtime and dispositions of 13 MBOED, 45 Table of Contents our production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased by 70 MBOED, or 5 percent, compared with 2014. Full-year 2015 production from assets sold or under agreement was 64 MBOED.

In 2016, Alaska contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2016 vs. 2015 Alaska reported earnings of $319 million in 2016, compared with earnings of $4 million in 2015. The increase in earnings was mainly due to: • Lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment charge for our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest. For additional information on our impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Reduced production and operating expense, mainly from lower maintenance costs and general and administrative expenses. • Enhanced oil recovery tax credits. • Higher crude oil sales volumes, partly offset by the absence of LNG sales volumes. • A $57 million after-tax impact for the recognition of state deferred tax assets. • A $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field. The increase in earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil prices and higher DD&A expense, mainly due to capital additions. Average production increased 1 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to new production from the Alpine CD5 drill site and strong well performance in the Greater Prudhoe Area. The production increase was partly offset by normal field decline. 2015 vs. 2014 Alaska reported earnings of $4 million in 2015, compared with earnings of $2,041 million in 2014, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a $368 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the impairment of our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest. The earnings decrease was partly offset by reduced production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices. 46 Table of Contents Average production decreased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by lower planned downtime activity and new production from the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas.

During 2016, the Lower 48 contributed 30 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 32 percent of our natural gas production. 2016 vs. 2015 Lower 48 reported a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016, compared with a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015. The increase in losses was primarily due to: • The absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in South Texas, East Texas and North Louisiana. • Lower crude oil and natural gas prices. • Lower sales volumes across all commodities due to dispositions and field decline. • Higher proved property impairments, including a $49 million after-tax impairment associated with changes to development plans for Eagle Ford infrastructure. The increase in losses was partly offset by: • Lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced activity and cost efficiencies. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Reduced other exploration costs, mainly due to the absence of a $216 million after-tax charge related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco in 2015, partly offset by 2016 rig cancellation and related third party costs of $95 million after-tax for our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. ¡ Lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses. ¡ Lower leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the Gila Prospect. The decrease in leasehold impairment was partly offset by 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds and $62 million for the Melmar Prospect, all in the Gulf of Mexico. 47 Table of Contents ¡ Lower exploration expenses were partly offset by slightly increased dry hole costs in 2016, including after-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $162 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells and $83 million associated with our Melmar well. Dry hole costs in 2016 were partly offset by the absence of a $111 million after-tax charge in 2015 associated with two wells in the Gila Prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • An $88 million gain associated with our receipt of Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. • A $48 million after-tax benefit from a damage claim settlement. • A $38 million after-tax gain from the disposition of non-core assets and lease exchanges. • Lower DD&A, mainly due to 2016 reserve additions and reduced volumes, partly offset by price-related reserve revisions. Our average realized prices in the Lower 48 have historically correlated with WTI prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our Lower 48 crude differential versus WTI began to widen. Our 2016 average realized crude oil price of $37.49 per barrel was 13 percent less than WTI of $43.20 per barrel. The differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast, Bakken and the Permian Basin, and may remain relatively wide in the near term. Total average production decreased 11 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and the 2015 disposition of non-core properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, as well as South Texas. The reduction was partly offset by new production and well performance, primarily from Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, as well as lower unplanned downtime. 2015 vs. 2014 Lower 48 reported a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015, compared with a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: • Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. • Higher DD&A, mostly due to increased crude oil production. • Higher exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Increased impairment expense in 2015, including after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the Gila Prospect, where we ceased further activity. ¡ A $246 million after-tax charge to exploration expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco. ¡ Higher dry hole costs, including $111 million after-tax, associated with two wells in the Gila Prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of a $545 million after-tax charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement in 2014; a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in South Texas, East Texas and North Louisiana; higher volumes; lower production taxes; and the absence of a $151 million after-tax impairment charge resulting from reduced volume forecasts on proved properties and the associated undeveloped leasehold costs. Total average production increased 2 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while average crude oil production increased 10 percent across the same period. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, partially offset by normal field decline. 48 Table of Contents Canada 2016 2015 2014 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ (935) (1,044) 940 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 7 12 13 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 23 26 23 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 35 13 12 Equity affiliates 148 138 117 Total bitumen 183 151 129 Natural gas (MMCFD) 524 715 711 Total Production (MBOED) 300 308 284 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 35.25 39.52 77.87 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 14.82 17.02 46.23 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 12.91 20.13 60.03 Equity affiliates 15.80 18.58 54.62 Total bitumen 15.27 18.72 55.13 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 1.49 1.91 4.13 Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2016, Canada contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 14 percent of our worldwide natural gas production. 2016 vs. 2015 Canada operations reported a loss of $935 million in 2016, a decrease in loss of $109 million compared with 2015. The decrease in loss was primarily due to: • The absence of a $136 million impact of a 2 percent increase in Alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes in 2015. • Lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced headcount and the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Reduced leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of an impairment charge for undeveloped leasehold in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas. The reduction in leasehold impairment expense was partly offset by a $23 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to decisions to discontinue further testing on undeveloped leaseholds. ¡ Lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses. ¡ Lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2015 charges associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties, partly offset by dry hole costs in 2016, including total after-tax charges in offshore Nova Scotia of $187 million for our Cheshire and Monterey Jack wells. 49 Table of Contents • Higher gains on dispositions, including the absence of a $103 million net after-tax loss on the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada in 2015. The decrease in loss was partly offset by lower commodity prices; higher DD&A expense, mainly from price-related reserve revisions; and a $42 million after-tax impairment charge related to certain developed properties in central Alberta, which were classified as held for sale, being written down to fair value less costs to sell. Total average production decreased 3 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, while bitumen production increased 21 percent over the same periods. The decrease in total production was mainly attributable to the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada and normal field decline. The production decrease was partly offset by strong well performance in western Canada, Surmont and FCCL. Surmont has fully recovered from the forest fire impacts. 2015 vs. 2014 Canada operations reported a loss of $1,044 million in 2015, a reduction in earnings of $1,984 million compared with 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: • Lower bitumen and natural gas prices. • Higher exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Higher dry hole costs, including an after-tax charge of $185 million associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties. ¡ An after-tax impairment charge of $75 million for undeveloped leaseholds in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas. • A 2 percent increase in Alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes. • A $103 million net after-tax loss realized on the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. The earnings decrease was partly offset by higher bitumen production volumes; lower operating expenses and DD&A, both primarily from favorable foreign currency impacts; and the absence of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties in 2014. Total average production increased 8 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same periods. The increases in total production were mainly attributable to strong well performance in western Canada, lower royalty impacts, strong plant performance at Foster Creek and Christina Lake and the continued ramp-up of production from Foster Creek Phase F. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and increased unplanned downtime, including the precautionary shut down of Foster Creek for nearby forest fires in the second quarter of 2015. 50 Table of Contents Europe and North Africa 2016 2015 2014 Income from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 394 409 814 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 122 120 134 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 7 7 8 Natural gas (MMCFD) 460 476 464 Total Production (MBOED) 205 207 219 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 43.66 52.75 98.98 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 22.62 27.56 52.65 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 4.71 7.14 9.28 The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and Libya. In 2016, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production. 2016 vs. 2015 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $394 million decreased 4 percent in 2016. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the U.K. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015; lower crude oil and natural gas prices; lower sales volumes; and the absence of a 2015 after-tax gain of $49 million on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled). The decrease in earnings was partly offset by: • Lower property impairments, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $317 million in the U.K. due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices, and a $180 million credit to impairment in 2016 due to decreased asset retirement obligation estimates on fields that are nearing the end of life and were impaired in prior years. The reduction in property impairments was partly offset by a $59 million after-tax charge associated with our Calder Field and Rivers terminal in the U.K. For additional information on our impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Lower DD&A expense in the U.K. driven by reduced rate, as a result of completed depreciation on the Brodgar H3 tie-back well in 2015, and lower volumes. • A $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in September 2016 and effective January 1, 2016. • Reduced operating expenses across the segment. Average production decreased 1 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease in production was mainly due to normal field decline, partly offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from the Greater Ekofisk and Greater Britannia areas. Libya production remained largely shut in, as the Es Sider crude oil export terminal closure continued throughout the third quarter of 2016. Production resumed in Libya in October 2016, with three crude liftings from Es Sider in January 2017. We expect a gradual ramp-up in activity. 51 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations decreased 50 percent in 2015. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Earnings further decreased due to higher property impairments in the U.K., given lower natural gas prices and increases to asset retirement obligations. The earnings decrease was partly offset by a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the U.K. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015, and an after-tax gain of $49 million on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled). For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production decreased 5 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in production was mostly due to normal field decline and lower volumes from Libya, partly offset by the new production from the Greater Britannia Area, the J-Area and the Greater Ekofisk Area, as well as improved well performance in Norway. The Es Sider Terminal in Libya remained shut in throughout 2015 as a result of civil unrest. 52 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2016 2015 2014 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (millions of dollars) $ 265 (406) 3,008 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 97 91 79 Equity affiliates 14 14 15 Total crude oil 111 105 94 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 7 9 10 Equity affiliates 8 7 8 Total natural gas liquids 15 16 18 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 730 717 723 Equity affiliates 899 638 505 Total natural gas 1,629 1,355 1,228 Total Production (MBOED) 399 347 317 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 42.23 49.70 95.32 Equity affiliates 44.11 53.12 99.01 Total crude oil 42.47 50.16 95.92 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 29.00 37.78 69.36 Equity affiliates 31.13 35.79 67.20 Total natural gas liquids 30.11 36.88 68.46 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 4.31 6.23 9.80 Equity affiliates 2.97 4.83 9.79 Total natural gas 3.57 5.58 9.80 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Brunei. During 2016, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 42 percent of our natural gas production. 2016 vs. 2015 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported earnings of $265 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $406 million in 2015. The earnings increase was mainly due to: • The absence of a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in 2015. For additional information on our APLNG impairment, see the “APLNG” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Higher LNG sales volumes. 53 Table of Contents • Lower production taxes. • Reduced feedstock costs at Darwin LNG. • Lower operating expenses, mainly due to lower general and administrative spend, maintenance costs and transportation expenses across the segment. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to lower dry hole costs, as well as the absence of a $41 million after-tax charge in 2015 for the impairment of our relinquished Palangkaraya PSC, and reduced exploration general and administrative expense. The earnings increase was partly offset by lower prices across all commodities; lower equity earnings from APLNG, mainly as a result of higher DD&A expense from APLNG Trains 1 and 2 coming online; and a third-quarter 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from APLNG’s tax functional currency change. Average production increased 15 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. The production increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to new production from the ramp-up of APLNG in Australia and the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia, improved drilling and well performance in China and Malaysia, and increased recoveries from production sharing contracts in Indonesia. The production increase was partially offset by normal field decline across the segment. 2015 vs. 2014 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a loss of $406 million in 2015, compared with income of $3,008 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower prices across all commodities. Earnings in 2015 were further decreased by a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment, higher DD&A expense from increased volumes, primarily in Malaysia, and a $41 million after-tax charge for the impairment of our relinquished Palangkaraya PSC. The earnings decrease was partially offset by lower production taxes, increased volumes, as well as lower feedstock costs and reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility. Average production increased 9 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The production increase was mainly attributable to new production from Gumusut, in Malaysia, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2014; the ramp-up of APLNG production due to additional gas processing facilities online; and infill drilling in China. Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.

The decrease in losses was primarily due to the absence of after-tax charges in 2015 of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our Angola Block 36, Angola Block 37 and Poland leasehold, respectively. Additionally, losses decreased due to the absence of the 2015 after-tax dry hole expenses offshore Angola of $81 million for the Omosi-1 well and $59 million for the Vali-1 well, combined with a $138 million gain on the disposition of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal. 2015 vs. 2014 Other International operations reported a loss of $593 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $100 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to after-tax charges of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our Angola Block 36, Angola Block 37 and Poland leasehold, respectively. Earnings were also reduced due to increased dry hole expenses for the Omosi-1 and Vali-1 wells offshore Angola and the absence of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability. The reduction in earnings was partly offset by the absence of the $136 million after-tax charge in 2014 for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola; and a $53 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our interest in the Polar Lights Company. For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Average production was flat in 2015 compared with 2014.

Net interest increased 89 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the 2015 impacts from the fair market value of apportioning interest expense in the United States, lower capitalized interest on projects, and increased debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 17 percent in 2016, mainly due to increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs, partly offset by lower staff expenses. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on tight oil reservoirs, heavy oil and oil sands, as well as LNG. Earnings from Technology were $50 million in 2016, compared with $122 million in 2015. The decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset by reduced technology program spend. 55 Table of Contents The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. “Other” expenses decreased 34 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower restructuring costs and favorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by the absence of a 2015 tax benefit. 2015 vs. 2014 Net interest increased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily as a result of lower capitalized interest on projects completed or sold and increased debt. The 2015 net interest expense increase was largely offset by a $148 million net tax benefit for electing the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States for prior years. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 27 percent in 2015, mainly due to $143 million in after-tax pension settlement expense, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs. Earnings from Technology were $122 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $93 million in 2014. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher licensing revenues. Other expenses increased by $82 million in 2015, mainly due to $142 million after-tax in restructuring charges and foreign currency translation impacts, partially offset by lower environmental expenses. 56 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 4,403 7,572 16,412 Net cash provided by discontinued operations - - 157 Cash and cash equivalents 3,610 2,368 5,062 Short-term debt 1,089 1,427 182 Total debt 27,275 24,880 22,565 Total equity 35,226 40,082 52,273 Percent of total debt to capital* 44 % 38 30 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 9 % 7 5 *Capital includes total debt and total equity.

The primary uses of our available cash were $4,869 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $2,251 million to repay debt; $1,253 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $126 million to repurchase common stock. During 2016, cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,242 million, to $3,610 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $4,403 million, a 42 percent decrease from 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices across all commodities. Cash flows from operating activities were positively impacted by the $585 million and $642 million tax refunds received from the Internal Revenue Service during 2016 and 2015, respectively. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2016 production averaged 1,569 MBOED. Full-year 2017 production is expected to be 1,540 to 1,570 MBOED, which results in flat to 2 percent growth compared with full-year 2016 production, excluding Libya, of 1,540 MBOED when adjusted for 2016 dispositions of 27 MBOED. Production guidance for 2017 excludes Libya and the impact of future dispositions. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; 57 Table of Contents timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2016 was negative 194 percent. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2016, our reserve replacement was 35 percent (including 11 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the impact of lower prices and asset dispositions. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our 2017 capital budget, see the “2017 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2016 and 2015, revisions decreased reserves, while in 2014, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities Proceeds from asset sales in 2016 were $1.3 billion, primarily from the sales of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our 35 percent interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal; our 40 percent interest in South Natuna Sea Block B in Indonesia; our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet; and certain mineral and non-mineral fee lands in northeastern Minnesota. This compares with proceeds of $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily from the sales of certain western Canadian properties; producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana and in South Texas; a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas; and our 50 percent equity method investment in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights Company. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Outlook section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities On March 28, 2016, we reduced our revolving credit facility, expiring in June 2019, from $7.0 billion to $6.75 billion. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.25 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $500 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no direct borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. Under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper programs, no commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2016, compared with $803 million at December 31, 2015. Since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.75 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. 58 Table of Contents Due to the significant decline in commodity prices during 2015, and the expectation these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies conducted a review of the oil and gas industry. As a result of this review, our credit ratings, along with several other companies in the oil and gas industry, were downgraded. In the first quarter of 2016, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to “Baa2” from “A2,” with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to “Prime 2” from “Prime 1” and Fitch downgraded our long-term debt ratings to “A-” from “A” with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to “F2” from “F1.” In the second quarter of 2016, Standard and Poor’s downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to “A-” from “A,” with a negative outlook and our short-term commercial paper ratings to “A-2” from “A-1.” We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a further downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were downgraded further, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to commercial paper. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had direct bank letters of credit of $304 million and $340 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of further credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2016, was $27.3 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from the balance at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of obtaining a $1.6 billion three-year term loan and the issuance of $3.0 billion in new fixed rate notes, both in March 2016, partly offset by the retirement in October 2016 of the $1,250 million of 5.625% Notes at maturity, the $803 million repayment of outstanding commercial paper, and early repayment of $150 million of our term loan. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2016, decreased $338 million compared with December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. For more information, see Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To preserve our balance sheet strength and provide financial flexibility through the recent downturn, in the first quarter of 2016, we announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. The dividend was paid March 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016. In July 2016, we announced a dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend was paid September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 25, 2016. In October 2016, we announced a dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend was paid December 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 17, 2016. 59 Table of Contents Additionally, on January 31, 2017, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 6 percent, from $0.25 per share to $0.265 per share. The dividend will be paid March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2017. On November 10, 2016, we announced plans to purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock over the next three years. Repurchase of shares began in November and totaled 2,579,098 shares at a cost of $126 million, through December 31, 2016. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2016: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years 2–3 Years 4–5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 26,423 1,005 5,542 3,689 16,187 Capital lease obligations (b) 852 84 136 139 493 Total debt 27,275 1,089 5,678 3,828 16,680 Interest on debt and other obligations 15,765 1,318 2,371 1,964 10,112 Operating lease obligations (c) 1,626 277 410 504 435 Purchase obligations (d) 22,791 15,581 2,259 1,304 3,647 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,628 430 635 563 – Asset retirement obligations (f) 8,405 202 546 697 6,960 Accrued environmental costs (g) 247 25 46 42 134 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 42 42 (h) (h) (h) Total $ 77,779 18,964 11,945 8,902 37,968 (a) Includes $248 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $4,673 million. Purchase obligations of $6,232 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. 60 Table of Contents (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2017 through 2021. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2021, see Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $341 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars 2016 2015 2014 Alaska $ 883 1,352 1,564 Lower 48 1,262 3,765 6,054 Canada 698 1,255 2,340 Europe and North Africa 1,020 1,573 2,540 Asia Pacific and Middle East 838 1,812 3,877 Other International 104 173 520 Corporate and Other 64 120 190 Capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations 4,869 10,050 17,085 Discontinued operations in Nigeria - - 59 Capital Program $ 4,869 10,050 17,144 Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, totaled $32 billion. The 2016 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Permian Basin. • In Europe, development activities in the Clair Ridge, Greater Ekofisk, Aasta Hansteen, and Greater Britannia areas, and exploration and appraisal activities in the North Sea. • Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Greater Prudhoe Area and the Western North Slope, and exploration activities in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. • Major project expenditures associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. • Oil sands development in Canada. • Exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Exploration activities in offshore Nova Scotia and appraisal activities in western Canada. • Continued development in China, Malaysia and Indonesia, and exploration and appraisal activity in Senegal and Chile. 61 Table of Contents 2017 CAPITAL BUDGET In 2016, given our view of greater price volatility, we announced a plan for allocating cash across the business which sets annual capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes. Our 2017 capital budget of $5 billion reaffirms this strategy. We have shifted our capital allocation to focus on value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply unconventional programs in our resource base. We are planning to allocate approximately: • 46 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford and Bakken, as well as development drilling in Norway, Alaska and Canada. • 26 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on major projects in Alaska, China, Europe and Malaysia, as well as APLNG in Australia. • 15 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures. • 13 percent of our 2017 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal activity. These funds will primarily target the Permian and Niobrara, Colombia, Chile, Australia and Canada. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies. 62 Table of Contents Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. 63 Table of Contents Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2016, there were 14 sites around the United States in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $435 million in 2016 and are expected to be about $470 million per year in 2017 and 2018. Capitalized environmental costs were $192 million in 2016 and are expected to be about $275 million per year in 2017 and 2018. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. 64 Table of Contents Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2016, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $247 million, compared with $258 million at December 31, 2015, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2016 was approximately $1.4 million (net share before-tax). • The Alberta Specified Gas Emitter regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. The reduction requirement increased from 12 percent in 2015, to 15 percent in 2016 and will increase again to 20 percent in 2017. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these regulations in 2016 was approximately $8 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former U.S. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2016 was approximately $28 million (net share before-tax). • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. 65 Table of Contents We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2015, the company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 566,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances, the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $9 to $43 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income. 66 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASU No. 2016-02), which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. This ASU supersedes the existing requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, “Leases,” and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. While we continue to evaluate the ASU, we expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. For additional information, see Note 25—New Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2016, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $404 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $197 million. 67 Table of Contents The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately two years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, before-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2017 would increase by approximately $5 million. At year-end 2016, the remaining $3,659 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $2.5 billion is concentrated in nine major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2017. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2016, total suspended well costs were $1,063 million, compared with $1,260 million at year-end 2015. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” 68 Table of Contents Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2016, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $60 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2016 was approximately $8.6 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2015 and 3.7 billion BOE at the end of 2016. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2016 would have increased by an estimated $955 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. 69 Table of Contents When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two 70 Table of Contents purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,100 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $90 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” 71 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. • The impact of recent, significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Inability to maintain reserves replacement rates consistent with prior periods, whether as a result of the recent, significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions. • Changes in international monetary conditions and exchange controls, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates. • Reduced demand for our products or the use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources. 72 Table of Contents • Substantial investment in and development of alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments. • Volatility in the commodity futures markets. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. • Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Our inability to execute asset dispositions or delays in the completion of any asset dispositions we elect to pursue. • Our inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us. • Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this report. 73 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President of Finance, Commercial, and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 74 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed RateMaturity AverageInterestRate FloatingRateMaturity AverageInterestRate Year-End 2016 2017 $ 1,001 1.06 % $ - - % 2018 1,570 3.63 250 1.24 2019 2,250 5.75 1,450 2.31 2020 1,500 4.73 - - 2021 2,150 4.08 - - Remaining years 15,221 5.77 783 1.43 Total $ 23,692 $ 2,483 Fair value $ 26,824 $ 2,483 Year-End 2015 2016 $ 1,250 5.63 % $ 108 0.35 % 2017 1,024 1.03 - - 2018 1,547 3.68 250 0.69 2019 2,250 5.75 695 0.35 2020 1,500 4.73 - - Remaining years 14,371 5.72 783 0.81 Total $ 21,942 $ 1,836 Fair value $ 22,949 $ 1,836 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2016, or 2015, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2016 and 2015, were as follows: 75 Table of Contents In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2016 2015 2016 2015 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD - 200 $ - (3 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 13 - - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD - 147 - (2 ) Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD - 20 - 2 Buy U.S. dollar, sell British pound USD 25 - - - Buy British pound, sell Canadian dollar GBP 1,069 564 (168 ) 44 Buy British pound, sell Euro GBP - 3 - (1 ) Sell British pound, buy Norwegian krone GBP 51 - 1 - *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and British pound (GBP). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

1163165,COP,CONOCOPHILLIPS,2018,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes, and supplemental oil and gas disclosures included elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the company’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 70. The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 17 countries. Our diverse portfolio primarily includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets in Canada; lower-risk conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 11,400 people worldwide and had total assets of $73 billion. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Overview The global oil market is rebalancing. Crude oil prices improved in 2017, particularly during the latter half of the year; however, we believe prices are likely to remain cyclical in the future. In 2016, we updated our value proposition to position the company for long-term success, given our expectations. Our value proposition principles, namely to maintain financial strength, grow our distributions and pursue disciplined growth, remain essentially unchanged. However, we took steps to improve our competitiveness and resilience by establishing clear priorities for cash allocation. In order, the cash allocation priorities are: invest capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes and pays our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; reduce debt to a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade rating through price cycles; repurchase shares to provide value to our shareholders; and strategically invest capital to grow our cash from operations. In 2017, we took significant actions that allowed us to make substantial progress on our stated priorities. We believe that our commitment to our value proposition, as evidenced by the results discussed below, position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility. 30 Table of Contents Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2017 included the following: • Achieved full-year production excluding Libya of 1,356 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED); underlying production excluding the impact of closed and planned dispositions grew 19 percent on a production per debt-adjusted share basis and 3 percent overall. • Cash provided by operating activities exceeded capital expenditures by $2.5 billion, and exceeded capital expenditures and dividends by $1.2 billion. • Paid down $7.6 billion of balance sheet debt, ending the year with debt of $19.7 billion. • Generated approximately $16 billion from asset dispositions. • Announced year-end proved reserves of 5.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). • Repurchased $3 billion of shares; reduced ending share count by 5 percent year over year. • Reached settlement on Ecuador arbitration for $337 million. Operationally, we continue to focus on safely executing our capital program and remaining attentive to our costs. Production excluding Libya was 1,356 MBOED in 2017 compared with 1,567 MBOED in 2016. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191 MBOED in 2017 and 434 MBOED in 2016 and Libya, increased 32 MBOED, or 3 percent year over year. Underlying production on a per debt-adjusted share basis grew by 19 percent compared to 2016. Production per debt-adjusted share is calculated on an underlying production basis using ending period debt divided by ending share price plus ending shares outstanding. We believe production per debt-adjusted share is useful to investors as it provides a consistent view of production on a total equity basis by converting debt to equity and allows for comparisons across peer companies. We accomplished several strategic milestones in 2017, including progressing our efforts to optimize our portfolio. Our asset dispositions are in line with our strategy, announced in November 2016, to focus on low cost-of-supply projects in our portfolio that strategically fit our development plans. We generated approximately $16 billion in total consideration from the disposition of certain noncore assets which were directed to our stated cash priorities and general corporate purposes. For additional information on our dispositions, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2017, we reduced debt by $7.6 billion to $19.7 billion at year-end and repurchased 64 million shares of our common stock totaling $3 billion. Consistent with our commitment to grow our distributions, in the first quarter of 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend by 6 percent to $0.265 per share. We are managing our business to optimize and deliver on our value propositions and cash priorities in a demanding business environment. Business Environment After elevated levels of volatility in 2016, global market fundamentals trended towards a firmer balance in 2017. Crude oil prices improved in 2017 as a result of slower growth in global oil production, strong global oil demand and lower global inventory levels. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the disciplined financial and operational priorities that underpin our value proposition. 31 Table of Contents Priorities The priorities we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include: • Focus on financial returns. This is a core aspect of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by controlling our costs, exercising capital discipline and continually optimizing our portfolio. ¡ Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. In 2017, including asset disposition impacts, we reduced our production and operating expenses by 9 percent as compared to 2016. ¡ Maintain capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. Given our view of greater price volatility, we have shifted our capital allocation to focus on shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply, unconventional programs in our resource base. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend. Additional allocations of capital toward growth projects will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial priorities. We use a disciplined approach, focused on value maximization and cash flow expansion, to set our capital plans. In November 2017, we announced a 2018 capital budget of $5.5 billion, including $3.5 billion of sustaining capital and $2 billion in accretive, short-cycle unconventional programs, future major projects and exploration activities. ¡ Optimize our portfolio. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets which strategically fit our development plans. In 2017, we generated approximately $16 billion in total consideration from dispositions of certain noncore assets in our portfolio, including our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets; our interests in the San Juan Basin; and our interest in the Panhandle assets. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives. • Maintain financial strength. We believe financial strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. In 2017, using proceeds from asset dispositions and cash flow from operations, we reduced our debt by $7.6 billion to $19.7 billion at year-end. On a longer-term basis, in November 2017, we announced our plan to reduce debt to $15 billion by year-end 2019, a significant acceleration from the previously stated expectation of $20 billion in the same timeframe. We expect to retire outstanding debt as it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our other debt instruments. • Return capital to shareholders. In 2017, we paid dividends on our common stock of $1.3 billion and repurchased $3 billion of our common stock. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through the price cycles. As a result, we set a priority to increase our dividend rate annually and purchase up to approximately $3 billion of our common stock evenly from 2018 through 2019. 32 Table of Contents On February 1, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. Additionally, we announced the acceleration of our previously stated 2018 share repurchases from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. In addition to our previously announced share repurchase program above, we are currently planning to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our common stock through 2020. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including Board authorization, market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” • Maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2017 focused on implementing our action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions. To demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on November 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2030. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and Environment and operational performance. • Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in two ways: ¡ Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. ¡ Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Asset dispositions in 2017 reduced our reported year-end proved reserves, but were partly offset by increased commodity prices. In 2017, our reserve replacement, which included a reduction of 1.9 billion BOE from dispositions, was negative 168 percent. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 200 percent in 2017. In the five years ended December 31, 2017, our reserve replacement was negative 24 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices. Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Additionally, as we continue cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. • Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. • Develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. 33 Table of Contents Other Factors Affecting Profitability Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. Industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Brent crude oil prices averaged $61.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 24 percent compared with $49.46 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices increased 13 percent from $49.18 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $55.35 per barrel in the same period of 2017. Global oil prices began to improve at the end of 2016 and continued trending upward in response to stronger global demand and slower production growth. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $2.93 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 2 percent compared with $2.98 per MMBTU in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, on an annual basis, Henry Hub natural gas prices improved 26 percent from $2.46 per MMBTU in 2016, to $3.11 per MMBTU in 2017. The price improvement was as a result of growth in domestic demand, increased exports and lower U.S. inventories. Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $32.79 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 50 percent compared with $21.82 per barrel in the same quarter of 2016. Improving global crude oil prices resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price experiencing a 33 percent increase, from $29.36 per barrel in 2016 to $38.92 per barrel in 2017. The WCS benchmark price improvement, coupled with changes in costs per barrel resulting from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership, caused our realized bitumen price to increase relative to 2016. Our realized bitumen price was $22.66 per barrel in 2017, an increase of 48 percent compared with $15.27 per barrel in the same period of 2016. 34 Table of Contents Our worldwide annual average realized price was $46.10 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 40 percent compared with $32.93 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2016. Similarly, our worldwide annual average realized price was $39.19 per BOE in 2017, an increase of 38 percent compared with $28.35 per BOE in 2016, reflecting higher average realized prices across all commodities. North America’s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible. • Impairments. As mentioned earlier, we participate in a capital-intensive industry. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. In 2017, we recorded before-tax impairments of $6,601 million for proved properties and $136 million for unproved properties. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For additional information on our impairments in 2017, 2016 and 2015, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. Recent changes in the U.S. corporate income tax law, further discussed below, additionally impacted our effective tax rate in 2017. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were suspended or significantly curtailed from July 2013 to October 2016 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libya’s period of civil unrest. In 2016, the United Kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K. corporate tax rate by 10 percent. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Legislation”) was enacted, significantly revising the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings. We recognized a provisional, noncash tax benefit of $852 million, which is included as a component of our 2017 income tax expense, primarily related to the revaluation of deferred taxes at the lower 21 percent federal statutory rate. We did not incur nor expect to incur a tax cost related to the one-time repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings. While we anticipate the Tax Legislation will provide a positive impact 35 Table of Contents to our U.S. operations in the future primarily because of the reduced U.S. federal statutory rate, we do not expect to realize cash tax benefits from the Tax Legislation until we move into a U.S. tax paying position. The ultimate impact of the Tax Legislation may differ from our current expectations, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made or additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the Tax Legislation. For additional information, see Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity. Outlook Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED. This results in approximately 5 percent growth compared with full-year 2017 underlying production, which excludes the impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191 MBOED. First-quarter 2018 production is expected to be 1,180 to 1,220 MBOED. Production guidance for 2018 excludes Libya. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net loss attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Alaska $ 1,466 319 4 Lower 48 (2,371 ) (2,257 ) (1,932 ) Canada 2,564 (935 ) (1,044 ) Europe and North Africa 553 394 409 Asia Pacific and Middle East (1,098 ) 209 (463 ) Other International 167 (16 ) (593 ) Corporate and Other (2,136 ) (1,329 ) (809 ) Net loss attributable to ConocoPhillips $ (855 ) (3,615 ) (4,428 ) 2017 vs. 2016 Loss attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased $2,760 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to: • Higher commodity prices. • Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts. • Higher gains on dispositions, primarily due to a $1.6 billion after-tax gain in 2017 on the sale of certain Canadian assets. • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $996 million, primarily related to the disposition of certain Canadian assets. • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $852 million related to the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017. • Improved equity earnings, mainly due to higher realized prices, lower DD&A from asset disposition impacts, and the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for APLNG to the U.S. dollar. These increases were partly offset by lower volumes from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership. • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. • A $337 million award from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador. • Lower production and operating expenses, primarily due to asset disposition impacts. • Lower net interest expense, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and reduced debt. The reduction in loss was partly offset by: • Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and the ongoing marketing of the Barnett, as well as a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. • Lower volumes primarily due to asset dispositions in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments, as well as normal field decline. • A $238 million after-tax charge associated with our early retirements of debt in 2017. 37 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Loss attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased $813 million in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to: • Lower exploration expenses. Exploration expenses decreased mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense and dry hole costs. • Lower proved property and equity investment impairments, including the absence of a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG in 2015. • Lower production and operating expenses. • A $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in September 2016 and effective January 1, 2016. • The absence of a $129 million deferred tax charge from increased corporate tax rates in Canada in 2015. The decrease in loss was partly offset by: • Lower commodity prices. • The absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate in 2015. • Lower crude oil, natural gas liquids, and gas sales volumes. • Lower equity earnings, primarily driven by increased DD&A expense, as well as a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for APLNG to U.S. dollar. • Higher interest and debt expense. • Lower gain on dispositions, mainly due to the absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in our Lower 48 segment. Income Statement Analysis 2017 vs. 2016 Sales and other operating revenues increased 23 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher realized prices across all commodities, partly offset by lower sales volumes, primarily in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments as a result of dispositions. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $720 million in 2017. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices at QG3, APLNG and FCCL; the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax functional currency change; and reduced costs mainly from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership. The increase in earnings was partly offset by lower volumes as a result of our FCCL disposition. Gain on dispositions increased 505 percent in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a before-tax gain of $2.1 billion on the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased 107 percent in 2017, mainly due to a $337 million before- and after-tax International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration award from The Republic of Ecuador. The increase was partly offset by the absence of a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties and active leases from the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust and a $76 million before-tax damage claim settlement, both in our Lower 48 segment in 2016. Purchased commodities increased 25 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher commodity prices and increased activity. 38 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 22 percent in 2017, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower headcount and reduced activity. Exploration expenses decreased 51 percent in 2017, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. Leasehold impairment expense was reduced mainly due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges of $203 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds. The expense was further reduced by the absence of before-tax charges of $95 million for our Melmar leasehold and $79 million for various Gulf of Mexico leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset by a before-tax charge of $51 million for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and a before-tax charge of $38 million for certain mineral assets in our Lower 48 segment, both in 2017. Dry hole costs were reduced primarily due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $249 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $128 million for our Melmar well. The absence of a $256 million before-tax charge in 2016 for two dry holes in Nova Scotia further reduced costs. The reduction in dry hole costs was partly offset by 2017 before-tax charges of $288 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah, including wells previously suspended, and $63 million for several wells in the Powder River Basin. Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $146 million before-tax expense in 2016 related to the cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, as well as lower rig stacking costs in Angola. The decrease in expense was partly offset by a $43 million net before-tax charge in 2017 for the settlement of our drilling rig contract in Angola. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A decreased 24 percent in 2017, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts in our Canada and Lower 48 segments. Impairments increased $6,462 million in 2017. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased 12 percent in 2017, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and lower interest on debt. Other expense included before-tax charges of $302 million in 2017 for premiums on early debt retirements. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax benefit and effective tax rate. 2016 vs. 2015 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. Additionally, sales and other operating revenues decreased due to lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes, mainly from dispositions and field decline, partly offset by increased bitumen sales volumes. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 92 percent in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower commodity prices, increased DD&A mainly from Trains 1 and 2 being placed in service at APLNG, and a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax functional currency change. The decrease in earnings was partly offset by higher sales volumes at APLNG and FCCL Partnership, as well as lower production taxes at QG3. 39 Table of Contents Gain on dispositions decreased 39 percent in 2016. The decrease resulted from the absence of a $583 million before-tax gain in 2015 from the sales of producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, South Texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas, as well as a $26 million before-tax loss on the sale of our interest in the Block B PSC in Indonesia in 2016. The decrease was partly offset by the absence of a $149 million before-tax loss on the disposition of noncore assets in western Canada in the fourth quarter of 2015; and gains on the 2016 dispositions of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interests in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field, and noncore assets in the Lower 48. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased 104 percent in 2016, mainly due to a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties and active leases from the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other income was further increased $76 million before-tax for a damage claim settlement in our Lower 48 segment. Purchased commodities decreased 20 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower natural gas prices. Production and operating expenses decreased 19 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower operating expense activity, reduced headcount and dispositions of noncore assets, as well as favorable foreign currency impacts. SG&A expenses decreased 24 percent in 2016, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower headcount and reduced activity. The decrease was partly offset by increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs. Exploration expenses decreased 54 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs, and other exploration expenses. Leasehold impairment expense was reduced, mainly due to the absence of 2015 before-tax charges of $575 million for our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest; $493 million for Angola Blocks 36 and 37; and $447 million for certain Gulf of Mexico leases, partly offset by 2016 impairments of our Melmar, Gibson, Tiber and other Gulf of Mexico leaseholds. Dry hole costs were reduced due to the absence of before-tax charges of $1,141 million in 2015, mainly from wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Horn River and Northwest Territories in Canada, Angola Blocks 36 and 37, and Malaysia. The reduction in costs was partly offset by before-tax charges in 2016, including $434 million from several wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and $256 million for two wells in Nova Scotia. Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $335 million before-tax charge in 2015 related to the termination of our Ensco Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, partly offset by before-tax rig cancellation charges and third-party costs of $146 million for our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract in 2016. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments decreased 94 percent in 2016. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 18 percent in 2016, primarily as a result of lower production taxes, mainly in our Alaska and Lower 48 segments, given reduced commodity prices and the absence of the impact of a transportation cost ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the fourth quarter of 2015 in Alaska. Taxes other than income taxes were additionally decreased due to lower property taxes in 2016 in our Alaska and Lower 48 segments. 40 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense increased 35 percent in 2016, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects and increased debt. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax benefit and effective tax rate.

Represents quantities available for sale and excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. ***Thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day. We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2017, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. Total production, including Libya, of 1,377 MBOED decreased 12 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from noncore asset dispositions, including our Canada and San Juan transactions in 2017 and the sale of our interest in the Block B production sharing contract (PSC) in Indonesia in 2016, and normal field decline. The decrease in production was partly offset by production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Malikai and the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia; Surmont in Canada; and APLNG in Australia. Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway and China also partly offset the decrease in production. Excluding Libya, our 2017 production was 1,356 MBOED. Adjusted for the impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191 MBOED in 2017 and 434 MBOED in 2016 and Libya, our underlying production increased 32 MBOED, or 3 percent, compared with 2016. In 2016, total production, including Libya, of 1,569 MBOED decreased 1 percent compared with 2015. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from normal field decline and the loss of 72 MBOED 41 Table of Contents mainly attributable to the 2015 dispositions of several noncore assets in the Lower 48, western Canada and the sale of our interest in the Polar Lights Company in Russia. The decrease in production was partly offset by additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; APLNG in Australia; the Western North Slope in Alaska; the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia; and the Greater Ekofisk Area in Norway. Improved drilling and well performance in Canada, Norway, the Lower 48, and China, as well as lower unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 also partly offset the decrease in production. Assets sold in 2016 produced 27 MBOED and 36 MBOED in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Alaska 2017 2016 2015 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 1,466 319 4 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 167 163 158 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 14 12 13 Natural gas (MMCFD) 7 25 42 Total Production (MBOED) 182 179 178 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 53.33 41.93 51.61 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.72 5.22 4.33 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2017, Alaska contributed 22 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2017 vs. 2016 Alaska reported earnings of $1,466 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $319 million in 2016. The increase in earnings was mainly due to an $892 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the newly enacted Tax Legislation. Earnings were additionally improved due to higher crude oil prices in 2017. The earnings increase was partly offset by a $110 million after-tax impairment charge for the associated properties, plants and equipment of our small interest in the Point Thomson unit. Average production increased 2 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, as the impact of normal field decline was more than offset by well performance in the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas and lower unplanned downtime. 2016 vs. 2015 Alaska reported earnings of $319 million in 2016, compared with earnings of $4 million in 2015. The increase in earnings was mainly due to: • Lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment charge for our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest. For additional information on our impairments, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Reduced production and operating expense, mainly from lower maintenance costs and general and administrative expenses. • Enhanced oil recovery tax credits. 42 Table of Contents • Higher crude oil sales volumes, partly offset by the absence of LNG sales volumes. • A $57 million after-tax impact for the recognition of state deferred tax assets. • A $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field. The increase in earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil prices and higher DD&A expense, mainly due to capital additions. Average production increased 1 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to new production from the Alpine CD5 drill site and strong well performance in the Greater Prudhoe Area. The production increase was partly offset by normal field decline. Acquisition In January 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire certain oil and gas assets in Alaska for $400 million, subject to customary adjustments. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. We will have a 100 percent interest in approximately 1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery. Lower 48 2017 2016 2015 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (2,371 ) (2,257 ) (1,932 ) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 180 195 206 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 69 88 94 Natural gas (MMCFD) 898 1,219 1,472 Total Production (MBOED) 399 486 545 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 47.36 37.49 42.62 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 22.20 14.34 14.01 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.73 2.20 2.43 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2017, the Lower 48 contributed 30 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 27 percent of our natural gas production. 2017 vs. 2016 Lower 48 reported a loss of $2,371 million after-tax in 2017, compared with a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016. The increase in loss was primarily due to proved property impairments in 2017, totaling $2.5 billion after-tax, for our interests in the San Juan Basin and the Barnett which were written down to fair value less costs to sell. Lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes from asset dispositions and normal field decline further increased losses during the year. 43 Table of Contents The increase in losses was partly offset by: • Lower DD&A expense, mainly resulting from a lower unit-of-production rate from reserve revisions, disposition impacts and lower volumes. • A $689 million tax benefit, primarily related to the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the newly enacted Tax Legislation. • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to: ¡ Lower leasehold impairment expense, primarily the absence of 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds; $62 million for our Melmar leasehold and $52 million for various Gulf of Mexico leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset by an after-tax charge of $33 million for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and an after-tax charge of $24 million for certain mineral assets, both in 2017. ¡ Lower other exploration expenses, mainly due to the absence of a $95 million after-tax expense in 2016 related to the cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. ¡ Lower dry hole costs primarily due to the absence of 2016 after-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $162 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $83 million for our Melmar well, partly offset by 2017 after-tax charges of $187 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah and $41 million for several wells in the Powder River Basin. In 2017, our average realized crude oil price of $47.36 per barrel was 7 percent less than WTI of $50.90 per barrel. The differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast and Bakken. Total average production decreased 18 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin, partly offset by new production, primarily from Eagle Ford and Bakken. Asset Disposition On July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin for total proceeds comprised of $2.5 billion in cash after customary adjustments and a contingent payment of up to $300 million. The six-year contingent payment, effective beginning January 1, 2018, is due annually for the periods in which the monthly U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per million British thermal units. On September 29, 2017, we completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary adjustments. For additional information on our asset sales in the Lower 48, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2016 vs. 2015 Lower 48 reported a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016, compared with a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015. The increase in losses was primarily due to: • The absence of a $368 million after-tax gain on the disposition of certain properties in South Texas, East Texas and North Louisiana. • Lower crude oil and natural gas prices. • Lower sales volumes across all commodities due to dispositions and field decline. • Higher proved property impairments, including a $49 million after-tax impairment associated with changes to development plans for Eagle Ford infrastructure. 44 Table of Contents The increase in losses was partly offset by: • Lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced activity and cost efficiencies. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Reduced other exploration costs, mainly due to the absence of a $216 million after-tax charge related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco in 2015, partly offset by 2016 rig cancellation and related third party costs of $95 million after-tax for our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. ¡ Lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses. ¡ Lower leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the Gila Prospect. The decrease in leasehold impairment was partly offset by 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds and $62 million for the Melmar Prospect, all in the Gulf of Mexico. ¡ Lower exploration expenses were partly offset by slightly increased dry hole costs in 2016, including after-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $162 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells and $83 million associated with our Melmar well. Dry hole costs in 2016 were partly offset by the absence of a $111 million after-tax charge in 2015 associated with two wells in the Gila Prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • An $88 million gain associated with our receipt of Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. • A $48 million after-tax benefit from a damage claim settlement. • A $38 million after-tax gain from the disposition of noncore assets and lease exchanges. • Lower DD&A, mainly due to 2016 reserve additions and reduced volumes, partly offset by price-related reserve revisions. Total average production decreased 11 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and the 2015 disposition of noncore properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, as well as South Texas. The reduction was partly offset by new production and well performance, primarily from Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, as well as lower unplanned downtime. 45 Table of Contents Canada 2017 2016 2015 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 2,564 (935) (1,044) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 3 7 12 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 9 23 26 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 59 35 13 Equity affiliates 63 148 138 Total bitumen 122 183 151 Natural gas (MMCFD) 187 524 715 Total Production (MBOED) 165 300 308 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 43.69 35.25 39.52 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 21.51 14.82 17.02 Bitumen (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 21.43 12.91 20.13 Equity affiliates 23.83 15.80 18.58 Total bitumen 22.66 15.27 18.72 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 1.93 1.49 1.91 Our Canadian operations mainly consist of an oil sands development in the Athabasca region of northeastern Alberta and a liquids-rich unconventional play in western Canada. In 2017, Canada contributed 16 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 6 percent of our worldwide natural gas production. 2017 vs. 2016 Canada operations reported earnings of $2,564 million in 2017, an increase of $3,499 million compared with 2016. The earnings increase was mainly due to an after-tax gain of $1.6 billion on the sale of certain Canadian assets, further discussed below, as well as the recognition of $996 million in deferred tax benefits related to the capital gains component of our disposition and the recognition of previously unrealizable Canadian tax basis. In addition to the items discussed above, earnings were further increased due to: • Lower DD&A, mainly from disposition impacts. • Lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2016 combined after-tax charges in offshore Nova Scotia of $187 million for our Cheshire and Monterey Jack wells. • Higher realized prices across all commodities. • A $114 million tax benefit related to our prior decision to exit Nova Scotia deepwater exploration. • Lower production and operating expenses. • Improved equity earnings, as improved prices and reduced DD&A more than offset the volume loss from our Canada disposition. 46 Table of Contents The earnings increase was partly offset by additional volume reductions from the disposition of our western Canada gas assets. Total average production decreased 45 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The production decrease was primarily due to the Canada disposition, partly offset by production ramp-up at Surmont. Asset Disposition On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction was $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments, 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares and a five-year uncapped contingent payment. The contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million Canadian dollars (CAD) for every $1 CAD by which the Western Canada Select (WCS) quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. See Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Note 6—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our Canada disposition. 2016 vs. 2015 Canada operations reported a loss of $935 million in 2016, a decrease in loss of $109 million compared with 2015. The decrease in loss was primarily due to: • The absence of a $136 million impact of a 2 percent increase in Alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes in 2015. • Lower production and operating expenses, mainly due to reduced headcount and the disposition of noncore assets in western Canada. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to: ¡ Reduced leasehold impairment expense, including the absence of an impairment charge for undeveloped leasehold in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas. The reduction in leasehold impairment expense was partly offset by a $23 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to decisions to discontinue further testing on undeveloped leaseholds. ¡ Lower general and administrative, and geological and geophysical expenses. ¡ Lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2015 charges associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties, partly offset by dry hole costs in 2016, including total after-tax charges in offshore Nova Scotia of $187 million for our Cheshire and Monterey Jack wells. • Higher gains on dispositions, including the absence of a $103 million net after-tax loss on the disposition of noncore assets in western Canada in 2015. The decrease in loss was partly offset by lower commodity prices; higher DD&A expense, mainly from price-related reserve revisions; and a $42 million after-tax impairment charge related to certain developed properties in central Alberta, which were classified as held for sale, being written down to fair value less costs to sell. Total average production decreased 3 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, while bitumen production increased 21 percent over the same periods. The decrease in total production was mainly attributable to the disposition of noncore assets in western Canada and normal field decline. The production decrease was partly offset by strong well performance in western Canada, Surmont and FCCL. 47 Table of Contents Europe and North Africa 2017 2016 2015 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 553 394 409 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 142 122 120 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 8 7 7 Natural gas (MMCFD) 484 460 476 Total Production (MBOED) 230 205 207 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 54.21 43.66 52.75 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 34.07 22.62 27.56 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 5.70 4.71 7.14 The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and Libya. In 2017, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 18 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 15 percent of our natural gas production. 2017 vs. 2016 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $553 million increased 40 percent in 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher realized crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Earnings were additionally improved by lower DD&A, mainly due to reserve revisions; a $60 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the newly enacted Tax Legislation; and a $41 million tax benefit in Norway. The increase in earnings was partly offset by the absence of a 2016 net deferred tax benefit of $161 million resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate and a lower credit to impairment in 2017, compared to 2016, reflecting the annual updates to asset retirement obligations (ARO) on fields at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years. The earnings improvement was further reduced by a net deferred tax charge of $65 million in the U.K. resulting from updated assumptions regarding applicable tax rates. Average production increased 12 percent in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was mainly due to the resumption and ramp-up of production in Libya; improved drilling and well performance in Norway; new production from the Greater Britannia Area and Norway; and higher Norway gas offtake, partly offset by normal field decline. 2016 vs. 2015 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $394 million decreased 4 percent in 2016. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in the U.K. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015; lower crude oil and natural gas prices; lower sales volumes; and the absence of a 2015 after-tax gain of $49 million on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled). 48 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings was partly offset by: • Lower property impairments, including the absence of 2015 after-tax charges of $317 million in the U.K. due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices, and a $180 million credit to impairment in 2016 due to decreased ARO estimates on fields at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years. The reduction in property impairments was partly offset by a $59 million after-tax charge associated with our Calder Field and Rivers terminal in the U.K. For additional information on our impairments, see Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Lower DD&A expense in the U.K. driven by reduced rate, as a result of completed depreciation on the Brodgar H3 tie-back well in 2015, and lower volumes. • A $161 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in September 2016 and effective January 1, 2016. • Reduced operating expenses across the segment. Average production decreased 1 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease in production was mainly due to normal field decline, partly offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from the Greater Ekofisk and Greater Britannia areas. Libya production remained largely shut in, as the Es Sider crude oil export terminal closure continued throughout the third quarter of 2016. Production resumed in Libya in October 2016. 49 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2017 2016 2015 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (1,098) 209 (463) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 93 97 91 Equity affiliates 14 14 14 Total crude oil 107 111 105 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 4 7 9 Equity affiliates 7 8 7 Total natural gas liquids 11 15 16 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 687 730 717 Equity affiliates 1,007 899 638 Total natural gas 1,694 1,629 1,355 Total Production (MBOED) 401 399 347 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 54.38 42.23 49.70 Equity affiliates 54.76 44.11 53.12 Total crude oil 54.43 42.47 50.16 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 41.37 29.00 37.78 Equity affiliates 38.74 31.13 35.79 Total natural gas liquids 39.75 30.11 36.88 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 4.98 4.31 6.23 Equity affiliates 4.27 2.97 4.83 Total natural gas 4.55 3.57 5.58 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as well as exploration activities in Brunei. During 2017, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 52 percent of our natural gas production. 2017 vs. 2016 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a loss of $1,098 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $209 million in 2016. The increase in loss was mainly due to a $2,384 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in 2017. For additional information on our APLNG impairment, see the “APLNG” section of Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, lower sales volumes in Indonesia, Australia and China further increased losses. 50 Table of Contents The increase in losses was partly offset by higher equity earnings, mainly as a result of higher commodity prices, increased sales volumes at APLNG and the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of our APLNG tax functional currency. Higher realized crude oil and natural gas prices on non-equity volumes further reduced the loss. Average production was essentially flat in 2017. 2016 vs. 2015 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported earnings of $209 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $463 million in 2015. The earnings increase was mainly due to: • The absence of a $1,502 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in 2015. For additional information on our APLNG impairment, see the “APLNG” section of Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Higher LNG sales volumes. • Lower production taxes. • Reduced feedstock costs at Darwin LNG. • Lower operating expenses, mainly due to lower general and administrative spend, maintenance costs and transportation expenses across the segment. • Lower exploration expenses, mainly due to lower dry hole costs, as well as the absence of a $41 million after-tax charge in 2015 for the impairment of our relinquished Palangkaraya PSC, and reduced exploration general and administrative expense. The earnings increase was partly offset by lower prices across all commodities; lower equity earnings from APLNG, mainly as a result of higher DD&A expense from APLNG Trains 1 and 2 coming online; and a third-quarter 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from APLNG’s tax functional currency change. Average production increased 15 percent in 2016, compared with 2015. The production increase in 2016 was mainly attributable to new production from the ramp-up of APLNG in Australia and the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia, improved drilling and well performance in China and Malaysia, and increased recoveries from production sharing contracts in Indonesia. The production increase was partially offset by normal field decline across the segment.

The increase in earnings was primarily due to a $320 million before- and after-tax ICSID award from an arbitration with The Republic of Ecuador. Earnings were additionally increased due to lower rig stacking costs in Angola. The increase in earnings was partly offset by the absence of a $138 million gain in 2016 on the disposition of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, and a $45 million tax charge from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the newly enacted Tax Legislation. 2016 vs. 2015 Other International operations reported a loss of $16 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $593 million in 2015. The decrease in losses was primarily due to the absence of after-tax charges in 2015 of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our Angola Block 36, Angola Block 37 and Poland leasehold, respectively. Additionally, losses decreased due to the absence of the 2015 after-tax dry hole expenses offshore Angola of $81 million for the Omosi-1 well and $59 million for the Vali-1 well, combined with a $138 million gain on the 2016 disposition of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2017 2016 2015 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (739 ) (980 ) (518 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (284 ) (289 ) (246 ) Technology 20 50 122 Other (1,133 ) (110 ) (167 ) $ (2,136 ) (1,329 ) (809 ) 2017 vs. 2016 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased 25 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and lower interest as a result of reduced debt. Higher interest income further drove the decrease in net interest, which was partly offset by lower capitalized interest on projects. Corporate general and administrative expenses which include pension settlement expenses and compensation program costs was essentially flat in 2017. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on tight oil reservoirs, LNG, oil sands and other production operations. Earnings from Technology were $20 million in 2017, compared with $50 million in 2016. The decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset by reduced technology program spend. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment and premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. “Other” expenses increased $1,023 million in 2017, mainly due to an $813 million tax charge from the revaluation of deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the newly enacted Tax Legislation and premiums on our early retirement of debt. 52 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Net interest increased 89 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of the absence of the 2015 impacts from the fair market value of apportioning interest expense in the United States, lower capitalized interest on projects, and increased debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 17 percent in 2016, mainly due to increases from market impacts on certain compensation programs, partly offset by lower staff expenses. Earnings from Technology were $50 million in 2016, compared with $122 million in 2015. The decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset by reduced technology program spend. “Other” expenses decreased 34 percent in 2016, mainly due to lower restructuring costs and favorable foreign currency impacts, partly offset by the absence of a 2015 tax benefit. 53 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,077 4,403 7,572 Cash and cash equivalents 6,325 3,610 2,368 Short-term debt 2,575 1,089 1,427 Total debt 19,703 27,275 24,880 Total equity 30,801 35,226 40,082 Percent of total debt to capital* 39 % 44 38 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 5 % 9 7 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement. In 2017, the primary uses of our available cash were $7,876 million to reduce debt; $4,591 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $1,305 million to pay dividends on our common stock; $1,790 million net purchases of short-term investments; $3,000 million to repurchase our common stock; and a $600 million contribution to our domestic qualified pension plan. During 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased by $2,715 million to $6,325 million. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $7,077 million, a 61 percent increase from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher prices across all commodities. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2017 production averaged 1,377 MBOED. Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED. This results in approximately 5 percent growth compared with full-year 2017 underlying production, which excludes the impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191 MBOED. Production guidance for 2018 excludes Libya. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. 54 Table of Contents To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2017 was negative 168 percent. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 200 percent in 2017. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2017, our reserve replacement was a negative 24 percent (including 3 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our 2018 capital budget, see the “2018 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2017, revisions increased reserves, while in 2016 and 2015, revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities Proceeds from asset sales in 2017 were $13.9 billion. We completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments and 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares. We completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin to an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. Total proceeds for the sale was $2.5 billion in cash after customary adjustments. We also completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary adjustments. Proceeds from asset dispositions in 2016 were $1.3 billion, primarily from the sales of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our 35 percent interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal; our 40 percent interest in South Natuna Sea Block B in Indonesia; our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet; and certain mineral and non-mineral fee lands in northeastern Minnesota. For additional information on our dispositions and investment in Cenovus common shares, see Note 4—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Note 6—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Results of Operations section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities We have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.75 billion, expiring in June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. We have two commercial paper programs. The ConocoPhillips $6.25 billion commercial paper program is available to fund short-term working capital needs. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $500 million commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016, under either the ConocoPhillips or the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper 55 Table of Contents program. We had no direct borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. Since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.75 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s reflected an improvement in their outlook for our debt from “negative” to “stable” and affirmed our long-term debt rating at “A-.” In January 2018, Fitch further improved their outlook for our debt from “stable” to “positive.” After improving their outlook for our debt from “negative” to “positive” in the first quarter of 2017, Moody’s Investor Services upgraded our long-term debt rating from “Baa2” to “Baa1” with a stable outlook in the third quarter of 2017 in response to our debt reduction. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had direct bank letters of credit of $338 million and $304 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 11—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 56 Table of Contents Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2017, was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $7.6 billion from the balance at December 31, 2016. In 2017, two notes totaling $1,001 million were paid at maturity, including the $1.0 billion 1.05% Notes due 2017. Also in 2017, we prepaid the $1,450 million term loan facility due in 2019. We also redeemed a total $5.0 billion of debt, described below, incurring $301 million in premiums above book value, which are reported in the “Other expense” line on our consolidated income statement. • 6.65% Debentures due 2018 with principal of $297 million. • 5.20% Notes due 2018 with principal of $500 million. • 1.5% Notes due 2018 with principal of $750 million. • 5.75% Notes due 2019 with principal of $2.25 billion. • 6.00% Notes due 2020 with principal of $1.0 billion. • 4.20% Notes due 2021 with principal of $1.25 billion (partial redemption of $250 million). In the fourth quarter of 2017, we gave notice to redeem the following debt instruments totaling $2.25 billion. • 2.2% Notes due 2020 with principal of $500 million. • 4.20% Notes due 2021 with remaining principal of $1.0 billion. • 2.875% Notes due 2021 with principal of $750 million. The prepayments occurred on January 22, 2018, and we incurred premiums above book value of $75 million. On a longer-term basis our debt target is $15 billion by year-end 2019. In the future, we may redeem other debt instruments or purchase debt instruments in the open market or otherwise, as we seek to achieve this target. Any such redemptions or purchases would be subject to market conditions and other factors, and may be conducted or discontinued at any time without prior notice. For more information on Debt, see Note 10—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 31, 2017, we announced a 6 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.265 per share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2017. On May 5, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. The dividend was paid on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2017. On July 12, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. The dividend was paid on September 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 24, 2017. On October 6, 2017, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share which was paid on December 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 16, 2017. Additionally, on February 1, 2018, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 12, 2018. On November 10, 2016, we announced plans to purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock through 2019. On March 29, 2017, we announced plans to double our share repurchase program to $6 billion of common stock through 2019, with $3 billion allocated and purchased in 2017, and the remainder allocated evenly to 2018 and 2019. On February 1, 2018, we announced the acceleration of our previously stated 2018 share repurchases from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, with the remaining balance to be repurchased in 2019. Since our share repurchase program began in November 2016, we have repurchased 66 million shares at a cost of $3.1 billion through December 31, 2017. In addition to our previously announced share repurchase program above, we are currently planning to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our common stock through 2020. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including Board authorization, market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” During the third quarter of 2017, we made a $600 million contribution to our domestic qualified pension plan, which is included in the “Other” line in the “Cash Flows From Operating Activities” section of our 57 Table of Contents consolidated statement of cash flows. This additional contribution significantly lowers our domestic pension deficit which will reduce future premiums charged by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It also mitigates the need for contributions in future quarters. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2017: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years2–3 Years4–5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 18,929 2,508 63 1,706 14,652 Capital lease obligations (b) 774 67 147 132 428 Total debt 19,703 2,575 210 1,838 15,080 Interest on debt and other obligations 13,884 955 1,881 1,834 9,214 Operating lease obligations (c) 1,548 278 628 433 209 Purchase obligations (d) 10,102 4,210 1,833 945 3,114 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,312 210 491 611 – Asset retirement obligations (f) 7,798 251 687 575 6,285 Accrued environmental costs (g) 180 25 36 29 90 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 51 51 (h) (h) (h) Total $ 54,578 8,555 5,766 6,265 33,992 (a) Includes $252 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 10—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis. (c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $3,487 million. Purchase obligations of $5,443 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2018 through 2022. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2022, see Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 58 Table of Contents (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $831 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars 2017 2016 2015 Alaska $ 815 883 1,352 Lower 48 2,136 1,262 3,765 Canada 202 698 1,255 Europe and North Africa 872 1,020 1,573 Asia Pacific and Middle East 482 838 1,812 Other International 21 104 173 Corporate and Other 63 64 120 Capital Program $ 4,591 4,869 10,050 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, totaled $19.5 billion. The 2017 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Oil and natural gas development and exploration and appraisal activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken, the Permian Basin, the Niobrara in the Denver-Julesburg Basin and several emerging plays. • Alaska activities related to development in the Western North Slope, Greater Kuparuk Area, and the Greater Prudhoe Area. • Development activities in Europe, including the Greater Ekofisk Area, Clair Ridge, Aasta Hansteen, and Heidrun. • Continued oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in Canada. • Continued development in Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and Australia; appraisal activity in Australia and exploration activity in Malaysia. 2018 CAPITAL BUDGET In November 2017, we announced a 2018 capital budget of $5.5 billion, including $3.5 billion of sustaining capital and $2 billion in accretive, short-cycle unconventional programs, future major projects and exploration activities. We are planning to allocate approximately: • 51 percent of our 2018 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, as well as development drilling in Australia/Timor-Leste, Norway and Alaska. 59 Table of Contents • 18 percent of our 2018 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures. • 17 percent of our 2018 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on major projects in China, Alaska, Europe and Malaysia. • 8 percent of our 2018 capital expenditures budget to new exploration activity, primarily in Alaska and the Lower 48. • 6 percent of our 2018 capital expenditures budget to development appraisal, including the Lower 48, Canada and Alaska. For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies. 60 Table of Contents Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas 61 Table of Contents resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2017, there were 14 sites around the United States in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $398 million in 2017 and are expected to be about $451 million per year in 2018 and 2019. Capitalized environmental costs were $170 million in 2017 and are expected to be about $223 million per year in 2018 and 2019. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. 62 Table of Contents At December 31, 2017, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $180 million, compared with $247 million at December 31, 2016, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2017 was approximately $1.5 million (net share before-tax). • The Alberta Specified Gas Emitter regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. The reduction requirement increased from 15 percent in 2016 to 20 percent in 2017. The total cost of compliance with these regulations in 2017 was approximately $3 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former U.S. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2017 was approximately $29 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta Operations totaling just over $1 million (net share before-tax). • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. 63 Table of Contents Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas: • Equipping the company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; and developing systems to handle GHG market transactions. • Reducing GHG emissions—In 2016, the company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 114,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across our business units. In 2017, we set a long-term target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity between 5 percent and 15 percent by 2030 from a 2017 baseline. Setting such a target demonstrates our continuing systematic approach to managing climate-related risks throughout the business. • Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances, the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies. • Engaging externally—The company is a sponsor of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. The company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions of $40 per metric tonne to evaluate future projects and opportunities. In 2017 and early 2018, cities and/or counties in California and New York have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. ConocoPhillips will be vigorously defending against these lawsuits. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities. 64 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASU No. 2016-02), which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. This ASU supersedes the existing requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, “Leases,” and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In January 2018, ASU No. 2016-02 was amended by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842.” We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019, and continue to evaluate the ASU to determine the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures, accounting policies and systems, business processes, and internal controls. We also continue to monitor proposals issued by the FASB to clarify the ASU and certain industry implementation issues. While our evaluation of ASU No. 2016-02 and related implementation activities are ongoing, we expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. For additional information, see Note 24—New Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. 65 Table of Contents This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2017, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $503 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $130 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 57 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, before-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2018 would increase by approximately $6 million. At year-end 2017, the remaining $3,249 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $2.4 billion is concentrated in nine major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2018. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2017, total suspended well costs were $853 million, compared with $1,063 million at year-end 2016. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. 66 Table of Contents Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2017, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $41 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2017 was approximately $6.4 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.7 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and 3.0 billion BOE at the end of 2017. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2017 would have increased by an estimated $726 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 67 Table of Contents Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected 68 Table of Contents benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,200 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $110 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” 69 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. • The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development in a timely manner (if at all) or on budget. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks, and information technology failures, constraints or disruptions. • Changes in international monetary conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 70 Table of Contents • Reduced demand for our products or the use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources. • Substantial investment in and development of alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments. • Volatility in the commodity futures markets. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business, including changes resulting from the implementation and interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. • Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. • Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Our inability to execute, or delays in the completion, of any asset dispositions we elect to pursue. • Potential failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, any necessary regulatory approvals for asset dispositions or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or the operation of our remaining business. • Potential disruption of our operations as a result of asset dispositions, including the diversion of management time and attention. • Our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions we undertake in the manner and timeframe we currently anticipate, if at all. • Our inability to liquidate the common stock issued to us by Cenovus Energy as part of our sale of certain assets in western Canada at prices we deem acceptable, or at all. • Our inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us. • Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any additional risks described in our other filings with the SEC. 71 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President of Finance, Commercial, and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitor commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2017, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2017 and 2016, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 72 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Floating Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Year-End 2017 2018 $ 2,250 3.31 % $ 250 1.75 % 2019 23 - - - 2020 - - - - 2021 150 9.13 - - 2022 1,014 2.45 500 2.32 Remaining years 14,207 6.00 283 1.70 Total $ 17,644 $ 1,033 Fair value $ 21,402 $ 1,033 Year-End 2016 2017 $ 1,001 1.06 % $ - - % 2018 1,570 3.63 250 1.24 2019 2,250 5.75 1,450 2.31 2020 1,500 4.73 - - 2021 2,150 4.08 - - Remaining years 15,221 5.77 783 1.43 Total $ 23,692 $ 2,483 Fair value $ 26,824 $ 2,483 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in available-for-sale securities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps and options for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards, swaps and options hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding foreign currency zero-cost collars buying the right to sell $1.25 billion Canadian dollars (CAD) at $0.707 CAD and selling the right to buy $1.25 billion CAD at $0.842 CAD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts as at December 31, 2017, was a before-tax loss of $9 million. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2017 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $74 million. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward-swap contracts. Since the gain or loss on the swaps was offset from remeasuring the related cash balances and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would have been no impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2016 exchange rates. 73 Table of Contents The gross notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD - 13 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell British pound USD - 25 - - Sell Canadian dollar, buy U.S. dollar CAD 1,250 - (9 ) - Buy Canadian dollar, sell U.S. dollar CAD 25 - 1 - Buy British pound, sell Canadian dollar GBP - 1,069 - (168 ) Sell British pound, buy Norwegian krone GBP - 51 - 1 Sell British pound, buy Euro GBP 1 - - - *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD), British pound (GBP) and Canadian dollars (CAD). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 16 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; lower-risk conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 10,800 people worldwide and had total assets of $70 billion. Overview In 2018, the energy industry continued to be volatile. Forecasts of worldwide economic growth and strong global demand for crude oil at the beginning of the year transitioned to concerns about a worldwide economic slowdown and an oversupply of crude oil by the end of the year. Additionally, production from major oil producing countries, including the United States, was strong. These factors caused crude oil prices to fall rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our business strategy anticipates prices will remain cyclical and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, with significant upside during periods of higher prices. Our value proposition principles, namely to focus on returns, maintain financial strength, grow our dividend and pursue disciplined growth, are being executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business. These priorities are: invest capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes and pays our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; maintain debt at a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating through price cycles; repurchase shares to provide value to our shareholders; and invest capital to grow our cash from operations. In 2018, we successfully delivered on our priorities. We increased our quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $0.305 per share; reduced our debt by $4.7 billion, achieving our debt reduction target 18 months ahead of plan and received credit rating upgrades from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s; repurchased 45 million shares of our common stock totaling $3.0 billion and received Board authorization for an incremental $9 billion of share repurchases; and added to our low cost of supply resource base, including increasing our legacy asset position in Alaska through two separate acquisitions. 34 Table of Contents Portfolio optimization, debt reduction and disciplined capital investment have positioned our company to navigate through periods of volatile energy prices. In December 2018, we announced our 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, which is less than our 2018 capital expenditures and investments of $6.8 billion. Our 2019 capital budget is relatively flat to the prior year when excluding $0.6 billion of acquisitions made in 2018. At this level of capital, production excluding Libya is expected to be 1,300 to 1,350 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in 2019 and would exceed 2018 production excluding Libya of 1,242 MBOED. This plan anticipates cash provided by operating activities in excess of capital expenditures and investments at prices above $40 per barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2018 included the following: • Cash provided by operating activities was $12.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures and investments of $6.8 billion, share repurchases of $3 billion and dividends of $1.4 billion. • The $4.4 billion of share repurchases and dividends represents 34 percent of cash provided by operating activities. • Reduced debt by $4.7 billion and achieved $15 billion debt target 18 months ahead of plan. • Received credit rating upgrades from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. • Full-year production excluding Libya of 1,242 MBOED; underlying production grew 18 percent on a production per debt-adjusted share basis. • Increased full-year Lower 48 Big 3 production—Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware—by 37 percent. • Achieved first production from Bayu-Undan final development phase, GMT-1, Bohai Phase 3, Aasta Hansteen and Clair Ridge. • Acquired additional working interest in our legacy assets in Alaska and increased our acreage in the liquids-rich Montney play in Canada and in the early-life cycle unconventional Louisiana Austin Chalk. • Executed successful exploration program in Alaska and started drilling in Louisiana Austin Chalk. • Reached a settlement agreement with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) to fully recover the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration award of approximately $2 billion; recognized $430 million before-tax toward the settlement. • Generated disposition proceeds of $1.1 billion from noncore asset sales. • Year-end proved reserves of 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE); 147 percent total reserve replacement and 109 percent organic replacement ratio. Operationally, we continue to focus on safely executing our capital program and remaining diligent on our costs. Production, including Libya, of 1,283 MBOED decreased 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. The volume from closed dispositions was approximately 200 MBOED in 2017 and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10 MBOED in 2018. Production from Libya was 21 MBOED in 2017 and 41 MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya, increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. Underlying production on a per debt-adjusted share basis grew by 18 percent compared to 2017. Production per debt-adjusted share is calculated on an underlying production basis using ending period debt divided by ending share price plus ending shares outstanding. We believe production per debt-adjusted share is useful to investors as it provides a consistent view of production on a total equity basis by converting debt to equity and allows for comparison across peer companies. In the second quarter of 2018, we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in the Alpine Transportation Pipeline, for $386 million, after customary adjustments. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired. In addition, we now have 100 percent interest in approximately 1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery. 35 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire its nonoperated interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area and Kuparuk Transportation Company (Kuparuk Assets) in Alaska, and to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 1 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired in the Greater Kuparuk Area, and net production in our Europe and North Africa segment included 5 MBOED related to the disposed 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field. We recognized a $774 million after-tax gain in the fourth quarter related to this transaction. Excluding receipt of $253 million in customary adjustments, this transaction was cash neutral. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after customary adjustments. In 2018, our Lower 48 segment net production included 8 MBOED related to the disposed interest in the Barnett, of which approximately 55 percent was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids. After-tax impairment charges of $69 million were recognized during 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals. No production or reserve impacts are associated with the sale. Proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes. The Greater Sunrise Fields are included in our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. For more information regarding the accounting impacts of these transactions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also during 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with PDVSA to recover approximately $2 billion, which reflects the full amount awarded to ConocoPhillips by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the rules of the ICC. PDVSA has agreed to recognize the ICC judgment and to make payments over the next four and a half years. During the year, we recognized in other income $417 million after-tax, consisting of $200 million in cash and the remainder in commodity inventory, the majority of which was sold by year end. For more information, see Note 4—Inventories and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Environment Brent crude oil prices averaged over $60 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018, rising to over $70 per barrel in the second and third quarters of 2018, before falling to the $50 per barrel range at the end of the year. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the disciplined financial and operational priorities that underpin our value proposition. Operational and Financial Factors Affecting Profitability The focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include: • Maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on November 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas emission 36 Table of Contents intensity by 2030. Our sustainability efforts continued through 2018 with a focus on advancing our action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights. In December 2018, we became a Founding Member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans for Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and Environment and operational performance. • Focus on financial returns. This is a core aspect of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by controlling our costs, exercising capital discipline and continually optimizing our portfolio. ¡ Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. In 2018, our production and operating expenses were relatively flat to 2017. ¡ Maintain capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across diverse, low cost of supply, programs in our resource base. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend. Additional allocations of capital toward growth projects will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial priorities. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a disciplined approach that evaluates projects on a cost of supply basis and is focused on value maximization and cash flow expansion. In December 2018, we announced a 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, including $3.8 billion of sustaining capital to maintain existing production levels, and $2.3 billion to grow production via short-cycle unconventional programs, future major projects and exploration activities. ¡ Optimize our portfolio. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost of supply assets that support our strategy. In 2018, we continued to dispose of or market certain noncore assets and made two acquisitions in Alaska to enhance our existing legacy asset position. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives. • Maintain financial strength. We believe financial strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. In 2018, we reduced our debt by $4.7 billion to $15.0 billion at year end, achieving our debt reduction target 18 months ahead of plan and received credit rating upgrades from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. We expect to retire outstanding debt as it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our other debt instruments. • Return capital to shareholders. In 2018, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.4 billion and repurchased $3 billion of our common stock, representing 34 percent of our cash provided by operating activities. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through the price cycles. As a result, we set a priority to increase our dividend rate annually and consistently repurchase shares on a dollar cost average basis. Since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late 37 Table of Contents 2016, we have bought back $6 billion of shares, with $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Our 2018 dividends, share repurchases, and capital program were fully funded with cash provided by operating activities. On February 1, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. In October 2018, we announced a dividend increase for the second time this year, an additional 7 percent, resulting in a quarterly dividend rate of $0.305 per share. In addition to the $6 billion of shares repurchased in 2016 through the end of 2018, in July 2018 we announced the authorization of an additional $9 billion share repurchases. We expect to execute $3 billion of this $9 billion share repurchase program in 2019. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” • Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in two ways: ¡ Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. ¡ Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. In 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a net increase of 0.2 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 147 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for over 90 percent of the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 109 percent in 2018. Approximately 33 percent of organic reserve additions are from Lower 48 unconventional assets, 29 percent from Alaska and 22 percent from Asia Pacific and Middle East. In the five years ended December 31, 2018, our reserve replacement was negative 30 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended December 31, 2018, which excludes a decrease of 2.1 billion MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 44 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period. Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. Such innovations enhance our ability to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. 38 Table of Contents • Develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. Other Factors Affecting Profitability Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. Industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Brent crude oil prices averaged $71.04 per barrel in 2018, an increase of 31 percent compared with $54.27 per barrel in 2017. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices increased 28 percent from $50.90 per barrel in 2017 to $64.92 per barrel in the same period of 2018. Crude oil prices improved year over year due to slower growth in global oil production and robust growth in global oil demand. Oil price volatility escalated in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to geopolitics and concerns about future economic growth. Henry Hub natural gas price averages were relatively unchanged, at $3.09 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in 2018 compared with $3.11 per MMBTU in 2017. Despite record high natural gas production, prices remained relatively flat year over year as relatively low inventories and strong demand offset production growth. Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $30.48 per barrel in 2018, an increase of 21 percent compared with $25.22 per barrel in 2017, in line with marker movements. The Western Canada Select (WCS) differential to WTI at Hardisty weakened by $14 per barrel in 2018 relative to 2017 due to a lack of pipeline egress coupled with increasing supply from western Canada. The weaker WCS differential offset year-over-year gains in WTI, resulting in the WCS price 39 Table of Contents at Hardisty remaining flat in 2018 compared with 2017 at $39 per barrel. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through the utilization of downstream transportation solutions and implementation of alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs. Our realized bitumen price was $22.29 per barrel in 2018, a decrease of 2 percent compared with $22.66 per barrel in 2017. Our worldwide annual average realized price was $53.88 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2018, an increase of 37 percent compared with $39.19 per BOE in 2017. The improvement reflects stronger marker prices, as well as a shift in our portfolio toward a higher mix of crude oil and less of bitumen and natural gas. North America’s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible. • Impairments. We participate in a capital intensive industry. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For additional information on our impairments in 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were suspended or significantly curtailed periodically over the last several years due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal. In 2016, the U.K. government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K. corporate tax rate by 10 percent. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) in 2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31, 2017, our assessment was ongoing for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Legislation under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and tax on global intangible low-taxed income. As of 40 Table of Contents December 31, 2018, we have now completed our assessment of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Legislation. During 2018, we recognized adjustments of $10 million to the provisional tax benefit amount of $852 million recorded at December 31, 2017, and included these adjustments as a component of income tax expense. While we still anticipate the Tax Legislation will provide a positive impact to our U.S. operations in the future primarily because of the reduced U.S. federal statutory rate, we do not expect to realize cash tax benefits from the Tax Legislation until we move into a U.S. tax paying position. For additional information, see Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity. Outlook First-quarter 2019 production is expected to be 1,290 to 1,330 MBOED, reflecting the impacts of a planned turnaround in Qatar of approximately 15 MBOED and government-mandated production curtailment in Canada of approximately 10 MBOED. Production is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year, with full-year 2019 production expected to be 1,300 to 1,350 MBOED. Production guidance for 2019 excludes Libya. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Alaska $ 1,814 1,466 319 Lower 48 1,747 (2,371 ) (2,257 ) Canada 63 2,564 (935 ) Europe and North Africa 1,866 553 394 Asia Pacific and Middle East 2,070 (1,098 ) 209 Other International 364 167 (16 ) Corporate and Other (1,667 ) (2,136 ) (1,329 ) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 6,257 (855 ) (3,615 ) 2018 vs. 2017 Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips increased $7,112 million in 2018. The increase was mainly due to: • Higher realized commodity prices on a more liquids-weighted portfolio. • The absence of a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and the marketing of our Barnett asset, recognized in the second quarter of 2017. • The absence of a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), recognized in the second quarter of 2017. • Recognition of $774 million after-tax gain on the Clair disposition in the United Kingdom, in the fourth quarter of 2018. • Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts. • Recognition of $417 million after-tax in other income from a settlement agreement with PDVSA in 2018. • Lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of first quarter 2017 charges in our Lower 48 and Other International segments. • Lower interest and debt expense because of a lower debt balance. • Higher equity earnings in Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and APLNG, primarily due to higher realized LNG prices, partly offset by the absence of volumes in 2018 related to the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership in Canada in 2017. These increases in net income were partly offset by: • The absence of $1.6 billion in after-tax gains related to the sale of certain Canadian assets in 2017. • The absence of a $996 million deferred tax benefit related to the disposition of certain Canadian assets, recognized in the first quarter of 2017. • The absence of deferred tax benefits totaling $852 million related to the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017. • An unrealized loss of $437 million on our Cenovus Energy common shares in 2018. • The absence of a $337 million after-tax award, including interest, from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador in 2017. 42 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Loss attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased $2,760 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to: • Higher commodity prices. • Lower DD&A expense, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts. • Higher gains on dispositions, primarily due to a $1.6 billion after-tax gain in 2017 on the sale of certain Canadian assets. • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $996 million, primarily related to the disposition of certain Canadian assets. • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $852 million related to the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017. • Improved equity earnings, mainly due to higher realized prices, lower DD&A from asset disposition impacts, and the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for APLNG to the U.S. dollar. These increases were partly offset by lower volumes from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership. • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. • A $337 million after-tax award, including interest, from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador. • Lower production and operating expenses, primarily due to asset disposition impacts. • Lower net interest expense, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and reduced debt. The reduction in loss was partly offset by: • Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and the marketing of the Barnett, as well as a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. • Lower volumes primarily due to asset dispositions in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments, as well as normal field decline. • A $238 million after-tax charge associated with our early retirements of debt in 2017. Income Statement Analysis 2018 vs. 2017 Sales and other operating revenues increased 25 percent in 2018, due to higher realized commodity prices, mainly crude oil, on a portfolio with a higher mix of crude oil and less of bitumen and natural gas. Partly offsetting this increase, were lower natural gas volumes sold due to 2017 dispositions in the Lower 48 and Canada. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $302 million in 2018. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to higher earnings from QG3 and APLNG as a result of higher LNG prices for both affiliates and higher oil prices in QG3. Partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of equity in earnings resulting from the disposition of our investment in the FCCL Partnership in 2017. Gain on dispositions decreased $1,114 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a $2.1 billion before-tax gain on the sale of certain Canadian assets recognized in 2017, partly offset by a $715 million before-tax gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 on the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. For additional information concerning gain on dispositions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Other income decreased $356 million in 2018, mainly due to a $437 million unrealized loss on our Cenovus Energy common shares in 2018 and the absence of a $337 million arbitration settlement, including interest, with The Republic of Ecuador in 2017. Partly offsetting the decrease, was $430 million before-tax from a settlement agreement with PDVSA in 2018. For discussion of our Cenovus Energy shares, see Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our Ecuador and PDVSA settlements, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities increased 15 percent in 2018, mainly due to higher crude oil volumes purchased and higher crude oil prices. Production and operating expenses increased 1 percent in 2018, primarily due to costs associated with higher underlying production volumes as well as higher maintenance and wellwork, largely offset by the absence of costs resulting from 2017 dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments. Exploration expenses decreased $565 million in 2018, primarily as a result of lower dry hole costs, leasehold impairment expense and other exploration expenses. Dry hole costs were reduced primarily due to the absence of before-tax charges of $288 million for multiple Shenandoah wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, including wells previously suspended. These charges were reflected in our Lower 48 segment during 2017. Leasehold impairment expense was reduced mainly due to the absence of before-tax charges of $51 million for Shenandoah and $38 million for certain Lower 48 mineral assets, both recognized in 2017. Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $43 million before-tax charge for the cancellation of our Athena drilling rig contract and other rig stacking costs in our Other International segment in 2017. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DD&A decreased $889 million in 2018, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from positive reserve revisions and impacts from the 2017 dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments, partly offset by increased underlying production volumes. Impairments decreased $6.6 billion in 2018, mainly due to the absence of 2017 impairments of $3.9 billion before-tax related to our former interests in the San Juan Basin and the Barnett, both in our Lower 48 segment, as well as a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. For additional information, see Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes increased $239 million in 2018, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska and the Lower 48 corresponding with higher realized commodity prices. Interest and debt expense decreased $363 million in 2018, primarily due to lower debt balances. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate. 44 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Sales and other operating revenues increased 23 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher realized prices across all commodities, partly offset by lower sales volumes, primarily in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments as a result of dispositions. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $720 million in 2017. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices at QG3, APLNG and FCCL; the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax functional currency change; and reduced costs mainly from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership. The increase in earnings was partly offset by lower volumes as a result of our FCCL disposition. Gain on dispositions increased $1.8 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a before-tax gain of $2.1 billion on the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets. For additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased $274 million in 2017, mainly due to a $337 million before- and after-tax arbitration award from The Republic of Ecuador. The increase was partly offset by the absence of a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties and active leases from the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust and a $76 million before-tax damage claim settlement, both in our Lower 48 segment in 2016. Purchased commodities increased 25 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher commodity prices and increased activity. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10 percent in 2017, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower headcount and reduced activity. Exploration expenses decreased 51 percent in 2017, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. Leasehold impairment expense was reduced mainly due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges of $203 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds. The expense was further reduced by the absence of before-tax charges of $95 million for our Melmar leasehold and $79 million for various Gulf of Mexico leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset by a before-tax charge of $51 million for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and a before-tax charge of $38 million for certain mineral assets in our Lower 48 segment, both in 2017. Dry hole costs were reduced primarily due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $249 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $128 million for our Melmar well. The absence of a $256 million before-tax charge in 2016 for two dry holes in Nova Scotia further reduced costs. The reduction in dry hole costs was partly offset by 2017 before-tax charges of $288 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah, including wells previously suspended, and $63 million for several wells in the Powder River Basin. Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $146 million before-tax expense in 2016 related to the cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, as well as lower rig stacking costs in Angola. The decrease in expense was partly offset by a $43 million net before-tax charge in 2017 for the settlement of our drilling rig contract in Angola. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents DD&A decreased 24 percent in 2017, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts in our Canada and Lower 48 segments. Impairments increased $6.5 billion in 2017. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased 12 percent in 2017, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and reduced debt balances. Other expenses included before-tax charges of $302 million in 2017 for premiums on early debt retirements. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate.

See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2018, our operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. 46 Table of Contents 2018 vs. 2017 Total production, including Libya, of 1,283 MBOED decreased 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to: • Disposition impacts from asset sales in Canada and the Lower 48 in 2017. • Normal field decline. • Higher unplanned downtime, including a third-party pipeline outage in Malaysia in 2018. The decrease in production during 2018 was partly offset by: • New wells online, primarily from tight oil plays in the Lower 48 and Malikai in Malaysia. • Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway, Lower 48 and China. • The continued rampup in Libya. Production excluding Libya was 1,242 MBOED in 2018 compared with 1,356 MBOED in 2017. The volume from closed dispositions was approximately 200 MBOED in 2017 and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10 MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya, increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. 2017 vs. 2016 Total production, including Libya, of 1,377 MBOED decreased 12 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to: • Reductions from noncore asset dispositions, including Canada and the Lower 48 in 2017 and the sale of our interest in the Block B production sharing contract in Indonesia in 2016. • Normal field decline. The decrease in production during 2017 was partly offset by: • Production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Malikai and the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia; Surmont in Canada; and APLNG in Australia. • Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway and China. Excluding Libya, our 2017 production was 1,356 MBOED. Adjusted for the impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191 MBOED in 2017 and 434 MBOED in 2016 and Libya, our underlying production increased 32 MBOED, or 3 percent, compared with 2016. 47 Table of Contents Alaska 2018 2017 2016 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 1,814 1,466 319 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 171 167 163 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 14 14 12 Natural gas (MMCFD) 6 7 25 Total Production (MBOED) 186 182 179 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 70.86 53.33 41.93 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.48 2.72 5.22 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. In 2018, Alaska contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2018 vs. 2017 Alaska reported earnings of $1,814 million in 2018, compared with earnings of $1,466 million in 2017. The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher realized crude oil prices. Additionally, earnings were improved due to the absence of a $110 million after-tax impairment related to our small interest in the Point Thomson Unit, recognized in the first quarter of 2017; a $98 million reduction in tax valuation allowance, recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018; lower DD&A expense from reserve additions; and a $79 million after-tax benefit resulting from an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Partly offsetting these increases in earnings, was the absence of an $892 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017. Average production increased 2 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to improved drilling and well performance, 8 MBOED from acquisitions in the Western North Slope and the Greater Kuparuk Area, and the startup of GMT-1 in the fourth quarter of 2018, partly offset by normal field decline. Acquisitions During the second quarter of 2018, we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in the Alpine Transportation Pipeline, for $386 million, after customary adjustments. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired. In addition, we now have 100 percent interest in approximately 1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery. In December of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire their nonoperated interest in the Kuparuk Assets in Alaska, and to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 1 MBOED related to the additional interest acquired in the Greater Kuparuk Area. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 48 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Alaska reported earnings of $1,466 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $319 million in 2016. The increase in earnings was mainly due to an $892 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation. Earnings were additionally improved due to higher crude oil prices in 2017. The earnings increase was partly offset by a $110 million after-tax impairment charge for the associated properties, plants and equipment of our small interest in the Point Thomson unit. Average production increased 2 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, as the impact of normal field decline was more than offset by well performance in the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas and lower unplanned downtime. Lower 48 2018 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 1,747 (2,371 ) (2,257 ) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 229 180 195 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 69 69 88 Natural gas (MMCFD) 596 898 1,219 Total Production (MBOED) 397 399 486 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 62.99 47.36 37.49 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 27.30 22.20 14.34 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 2.82 2.73 2.20 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous United States and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2018, the Lower 48 contributed 36 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production. 2018 vs. 2017 Lower 48 reported earnings of $1,747 million in 2018, compared with a net loss of $2,371 million in 2017. Earnings increased primarily due to the absence of a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and the marketing of our Barnett asset, recognized in the second quarter of 2017; higher realized crude oil and NGL prices; higher crude oil sales volumes; lower DD&A expense, primarily due to reserve additions and asset disposition impacts, partly offset by higher underlying volumes; lower exploration expenses and higher gain on dispositions related to noncore asset sales. The increase in earnings was partly offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, primarily due to the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin in 2017. In 2018, our average realized crude oil price of $62.99 per barrel was 3 percent less than WTI of $64.92 per barrel. The differential was driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast, Bakken and Permian Basin. 49 Table of Contents Total average production decreased 1 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and disposition impacts related to interests sold in the San Juan Basin and other noncore assets. Adjusted for the impact of dispositions of 82 MBOED in 2017, underlying production increased approximately 25 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to new production from unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian Basin. Asset Dispositions and Other Planned Disposition In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of certain properties in the Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $112 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In the second quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of a package of largely undeveloped acreage for net proceeds of $105 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In the third quarter of 2018, we completed a noncash exchange of undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment. This transaction was recorded at fair value resulting in the recognition of a $44 million after-tax gain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold several packages of undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment for total net proceeds of $162 million and recognized gains of approximately $140 million. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after customary adjustments. Production associated with the Barnett averaged 8 MBOED in 2018, of which approximately 55 percent was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids. After-tax impairment charges of $69 million were recognized during 2018. In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal and pipeline capacity was held for receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. As a result of entering into these agreements, we expect to recognize a loss of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2019. We have also entered into agreements to amend our contractual obligations for remaining use of the facilities. Completion of the sale is subject to regulatory approval. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Acquisition We began acquiring early life-cycle acreage in the Austin Chalk in the fourth quarter of 2017 and have accumulated approximately 225,000 net acres at less than $1,000 per acre. We spud our first Austin Chalk well in late 2018 and plan to drill additional wells in 2019. 2017 vs. 2016 Lower 48 reported a loss of $2,371 million after-tax in 2017, compared with a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016. The increase in loss was primarily due to proved property impairments in 2017, totaling $2.5 billion after-tax, for our interests in the San Juan Basin and the Barnett which were written down to fair value less costs to sell. Lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes from asset dispositions and normal field decline further increased losses during the year. 50 Table of Contents The increase in losses was partly offset by: • Lower DD&A expense, mainly resulting from a lower unit-of-production rate from reserve revisions, disposition impacts and lower volumes. • A $689 million tax benefit, primarily related to the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017. • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to: ¡ Lower leasehold impairment expense, primarily the absence of 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our Gibson and Tiber leaseholds; $62 million for our Melmar leasehold and $52 million for various Gulf of Mexico leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset by an after-tax charge of $33 million for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and an after-tax charge of $24 million for certain mineral assets, both in 2017. ¡ Lower other exploration expenses, mainly due to the absence of a $95 million after-tax expense in 2016 related to the cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. ¡ Lower dry hole costs primarily due to the absence of 2016 after-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $162 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $83 million for our Melmar well, partly offset by 2017 after-tax charges of $187 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah and $41 million for several wells in the Powder River Basin. In 2017, our average realized crude oil price of $47.36 per barrel was 7 percent less than WTI of $50.90 per barrel. The differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast and Bakken. Total average production decreased 18 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field decline and the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin, partly offset by new production, primarily from Eagle Ford and Bakken. Asset Dispositions On July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin for total proceeds comprised of $2.5 billion in cash after customary adjustments and a contingent payment of up to $300 million. The six-year contingent payment, effective beginning January 1, 2018, is due annually for the periods in which the monthly U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per million British thermal units. During 2018, we recorded gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of $28 million. On September 29, 2017, we completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary adjustments. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 51 Table of Contents Canada 2018 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 63 2,564 (935 ) Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 1 3 7 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 1 9 23 Bitumen (MBD) Consolidated operations 66 59 35 Equity affiliates - 63 148 Total bitumen 66 122 183 Natural gas (MMCFD) 12 187 524 Total Production (MBOED) 70 165 300 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) $ 48.73 43.69 35.25 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 43.70 21.51 14.82 Bitumen (dollars per barrel)* Consolidated operations 22.29 21.43 12.91 Equity affiliates - 23.83 15.80 Total bitumen 22.29 22.66 15.27 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 1.00 1.93 1.49 *Average prices for sales of bitumen produced during 2018 excludes additional value realized from the purchase and sale of third-party volumes for optimization of our pipeline capacity between Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our Canadian operations mainly consist of an oil sands development in the Athabasca region of northeastern Alberta and a liquids-rich unconventional play in western Canada. In 2018, Canada contributed 8 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than one percent of our worldwide natural gas production. 2018 vs. 2017 Canada operations reported earnings of $63 million in 2018 compared with $2,564 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to the absence of a $1.6 billion after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the FCCL Partnership and western Canada gas assets and an associated $1.0 billion deferred tax benefit, and equity earnings in the FCCL Partnership. For additional information on the Canada disposition, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions and Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total average production decreased 95 MBOED in 2018 compared with 2017. The production decrease was primarily due to our 2017 Canada disposition, partly offset by strong well performance at Surmont. Acquisition In February 2018, we acquired approximately 34,500 net acres of undeveloped land in the Montney for a net purchase price of approximately $120 million. The additional acreage is adjacent to our existing position in the liquids-rich portion of the Montney. 52 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Canada operations reported earnings of $2,564 million in 2017, an increase of $3,499 million compared with 2016. The earnings increase was mainly due to an after-tax gain of $1.6 billion on the sale of certain Canadian assets, further discussed below, as well as the recognition of $1.0 billion in deferred tax benefits related to the capital gains component of our disposition and the recognition of previously unrealizable Canadian tax basis. In addition to the items discussed above, earnings were further increased due to: • Lower DD&A, mainly from disposition impacts. • Lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2016 combined after-tax charges in offshore Nova Scotia of $187 million for our Cheshire and Monterey Jack wells. • Higher realized prices across all commodities. • A $114 million tax benefit related to our prior decision to exit Nova Scotia deepwater exploration. • Lower production and operating expenses. • Improved equity earnings, as improved prices and reduced DD&A more than offset the volume loss from our Canada disposition. The earnings increase was partly offset by additional volume reductions from the disposition of our western Canada gas assets. Total average production decreased 45 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The production decrease was primarily due to the Canada disposition, partly offset by production rampup at Surmont. Asset Disposition On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction was $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments, 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares and a five-year uncapped contingent payment. The contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million Canadian dollars (CAD) for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. During 2018, we recorded gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of $95 million. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Europe and North Africa 2018 2017 2016 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 1,866 553 394 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 149 142 122 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 8 8 7 Natural gas (MMCFD) 503 484 460 Total Production (MBOED) 241 230 205 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 70.71 54.21 43.66 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) 36.87 34.07 22.62 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) 7.65 5.70 4.71 53 Table of Contents The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and Libya. In 2018, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production. 2018 vs. 2017 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $1,866 million increased $1,313 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings in 2018 included a $774 million after-tax gain related to the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. Earnings were also improved due to higher realized crude oil and natural gas prices and lower DD&A expense, primarily due to reserve additions. Average production increased 5 percent in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher production in Libya and new wells online in Norway and the United Kingdom. These increases in production were partly offset by normal field decline and the final cessation of production in several producing gas fields in the Southern North Sea in the third quarter of 2018. Production associated with the Southern North Sea was 22 million cubic feet a day or 4 MBOED in 2018. Dispositions In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom and acquire their nonoperated interest in the Kuparuk Assets in Alaska. In 2018, our Europe and North Africa segment net production associated with the disposed 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field was approximately 5 MBOED. We recognized a $774 million after-tax gain in the fourth quarter related to this transaction, as discussed above. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. We are currently marketing our United Kingdom Business Unit. 2017 vs. 2016 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $553 million increased 40 percent in 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher realized crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Earnings were additionally improved by lower DD&A, mainly due to reserve revisions; a $60 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation; and a $41 million tax benefit in Norway. The increase in earnings was partly offset by the absence of a 2016 net deferred tax benefit of $161 million resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate and a lower credit to impairment in 2017, compared with 2016, reflecting the annual updates to ARO on fields at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years. The earnings improvement was further reduced by a net deferred tax charge of $65 million in the U.K. resulting from updated assumptions regarding applicable tax rates. Average production increased 12 percent in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was mainly due to the resumption and rampup of production in Libya; improved drilling and well performance in Norway; new production from the Greater Britannia Area and Norway; and higher Norway gas offtake, partly offset by normal field decline. 54 Table of Contents Asia Pacific and Middle East 2018 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 2,070 (1,098 ) 209 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated operations 89 93 97 Equity affiliates 14 14 14 Total crude oil 103 107 111 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated operations 3 4 7 Equity affiliates 7 7 8 Total natural gas liquids 10 11 15 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated operations 626 687 730 Equity affiliates 1,031 1,007 899 Total natural gas 1,657 1,694 1,629 Total Production (MBOED) 389 401 399 Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations $ 70.93 54.38 42.23 Equity affiliates 72.49 54.76 44.11 Total crude oil 71.14 54.43 42.47 Natural gas liquids (dollars per barrel) Consolidated operations 47.20 41.37 29.00 Equity affiliates 45.69 38.74 31.13 Total natural gas liquids 46.13 39.75 30.11 Natural gas (dollars per thousand cubic feet) Consolidated operations 6.15 4.98 4.31 Equity affiliates 6.06 4.27 2.97 Total natural gas 6.09 4.55 3.57 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar. During 2018, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 60 percent of our natural gas production. 2018 vs. 2017 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported earnings of $2,070 million in 2018, compared with a loss of $1,098 million in 2017. The increase in earnings was mainly due to the absence of a $2,384 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in 2017, higher realized commodity prices, and increased equity in earnings of affiliates, mainly due to higher LNG prices. See the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the 2017 impairment of our APLNG investment. 55 Table of Contents Average production decreased 3 percent in 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to unplanned downtime in Malaysia related to the rupture of a third-party pipeline which carries gas production from the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia and normal field decline. This decrease was partly offset by new wells online at Malakai in Malaysia and an infill drilling program in China. Asset Disposition In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals. No production or reserve impacts are associated with the sale. 2017 vs. 2016 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a loss of $1,098 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $209 million in 2016. The increase in loss was mainly due to a $2,384 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in 2017. For additional information on our APLNG impairment, see the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, lower sales volumes in Indonesia, Australia and China further increased losses. The increase in losses was partly offset by higher equity earnings, mainly as a result of higher commodity prices, increased sales volumes at APLNG and the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of our APLNG tax functional currency. Higher realized crude oil and natural gas prices on non-equity volumes further reduced the loss. Average production was essentially flat in 2017. Other International 2018 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 364 167 (16 ) The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia and Chile. 2018 vs. 2017 Other International operations reported earnings of $364 million in 2018, compared with earnings of $167 million in 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to recognizing $417 million after-tax in other income under a settlement agreement with PDVSA associated with an arbitration award issued by the ICC. Partly offsetting the increase in earnings, was the absence of a $320 million after-tax award from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador in 2017. See Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. New Country Entrance We received approval from Argentina’s government in January 2019 for a 50 percent nonoperated interest in the El Turbio Este block in the Austral Basin. 2017 vs. 2016 Other International operations reported earnings of $167 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $16 million in 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a $320 million after-tax International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) award from an arbitration with The Republic of Ecuador. Earnings were additionally increased due to lower rig stacking costs in Angola. The increase in earnings was partly 56 Table of Contents offset by the absence of a $138 million gain in 2016 on the disposition of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, and a $45 million tax charge from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation.

See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 2018 vs. 2017 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased $59 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to less interest from lower debt balances, higher capitalized interest on projects, and an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the FERC in the first quarter of 2018. Partly offsetting these impacts, were reduced tax benefits on interest expense following the Tax Legislation, which lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, and a lower tax benefit due to higher interest from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States. Corporate general and administrative expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These costs decreased by $102 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to lower staff expenses and costs associated with certain key employee compensation programs. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on tight oil reservoirs, LNG, oil sands and other production operations. Earnings from Technology increased by $89 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to higher licensing revenues. See Note 24—Sales and Other Operating Revenues, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense. Losses in “Other” decreased by $219 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the absence of an $813 million tax charge from the revaluation of deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017; lower premiums on the early retirement of debt; partly offset by a $437 million unrealized loss on our Cenovus Energy common shares. 57 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased 25 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States and lower interest as a result of reduced debt. Higher interest income further drove the decrease in net interest, which was partly offset by lower capitalized interest on projects. Corporate general and administrative expenses which include pension settlement expenses and compensation program costs increased $46 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher costs associated with certain key employee compensation programs and staff expenses. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on tight oil reservoirs, LNG, oil sands and other production operations. Earnings from Technology were $20 million in 2017, compared with $50 million in 2016. The decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset by reduced technology program spend. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment and premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Losses in “Other” increased $972 million in 2017, mainly due to an $813 million tax charge from the revaluation of deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation and premiums on our early retirement of debt. 58 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,934 7,077 4,403 Cash and cash equivalents 5,915 6,325 3,610 Short-term debt 112 2,575 1,089 Total debt 14,968 19,703 27,275 Total equity 32,064 30,801 35,226 Percent of total debt to capital* 32 % 39 44 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 5 % 5 9 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2018, the primary uses of our available cash were $6,750 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $4,995 million to reduce debt; $2,999 million to repurchase our common stock; and $1,363 million to pay dividends on our common stock. During 2018, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by $385 million to $6,151 million. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $12,934 million, an 83 percent increase from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from equity affiliates. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged 1,283 MBOED in 2018. Full-year production excluding Libya averaged 1,242 MBOED in 2018 and is expected to be 1,300 to 1,350 MBOED in 2019. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. 59 Table of Contents To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. In 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a net increase of 0.2 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 147 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for over 90 percent of the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 109 percent in 2018. Approximately 33 percent of organic reserve additions are from Lower 48 unconventional assets, 29 percent from Alaska and 22 percent from Asia Pacific and Middle East. In the five years ended December 31, 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a decrease of 2.1 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was negative 30 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended December 31, 2018, was 44 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our 2019 capital budget, see the “2019 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2018 and 2017, revisions increased reserves, while in 2016, revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 were $1.1 billion. We completed several undeveloped acreage transactions in our Lower 48 segment for a total of $267 million after customary adjustments and another transaction in our Lower 48 segment for $112 million after customary adjustments. We completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after customary adjustments. We also received $253 million net proceeds for customary adjustments related to our transaction with BP for the disposition of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary holding a 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and the acquisition of the Kuparuk Assets. We received contingent payments of $95 million in relation to our 2017 Canada disposition to Cenovus Energy. Proceeds from asset sales in 2017 were $13.9 billion. We completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments and 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares. We completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin to an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. Total proceeds for the sale were $2.5 billion in cash after customary adjustments. We also completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary adjustments. For additional information on our dispositions and investment in Cenovus common shares, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions and Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the Results of Operations section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In May 2018, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.75 billion to $6.0 billion with a new expiration date of May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions 60 Table of Contents and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips Company $6.0 billion commercial paper program which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We had no commercial paper outstanding in programs in place at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. We had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018. In August 2018, Fitch upgraded our long-term debt rating from “A-” to “A” and adjusted their outlook for our debt from “positive” to “stable.” In September 2018, Moody’s Investors Services upgraded its rating on our long-term debt from “Baa1” to “A3” and adjusted its outlook for our debt from “positive” to “stable.” In November 2018, Standard & Poor’s upgraded our long-term debt rating from “A-” to “A,” with a stable outlook. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had direct bank letters of credit of $323 million and $338 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 61 Table of Contents Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2018, was $15.0 billion, a decrease of $4.7 billion from the balance at December 31, 2017. We achieved our stated debt target of $15 billion eighteen months earlier than the original target date of year-end 2019. In 2018, we repaid the $250 million floating rate note due in 2018 at its natural maturity. We also redeemed or repurchased a total $4,450 million of debt, described below, incurring $208 million in net premiums above book value, which are reported in the “Other expenses” line on our consolidated income statement. • 4.20% Notes due 2021 with remaining principal of $1.0 billion. • 2.875% Notes due 2021 with principal of $750 million. • 2.4% Notes due 2022 with principal of $1.0 billion (partial repurchase of $671 million). • 3.35% Notes due 2024 with principal of $1.0 billion (partial repurchase of $574 million). • 2.2% Notes due 2020 with principal of $500 million. • 3.35% Notes due 2025 with principal of $500 million (partial repurchase of $301 million). • 4.15% Notes due 2034 with principal of $500 million (partial repurchase of $254 million). • 8.125% Notes due 2030 with principal of $600 million (partial repurchase of $210 million). • 7.8% Notes due 2027 with principal of $300 million (partial repurchase of $97 million). • 7.9% Notes due 2047 with principal of $100 million (partial repurchase of $40 million). • 9.125% Notes due 2021 with principal of $150 million (partial repurchase of $27 million). • 8.20% Notes due 2025 with principal of $150 million (partial repurchase of $16 million). • 7.65% Notes due 2023 with principal of $88 million (partial repurchase of $10 million). For more information on Debt, see Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 1, 2018, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 12, 2018. On May 4, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share. The dividend was paid on June 1, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018. On July 11, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share. The dividend was paid on September 4, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2018. On October 5, 2018, we announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.305 per share. The dividend was paid on December 3, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2018. On January 30, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 cents per share, payable March 1, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019. In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2018, we had announced authorization to repurchase a total of $6 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $3 billion in 2017 and $3 billion in 2018. On July 12, 2018, we announced an authorization of an additional $9 billion in share repurchases bringing the total program authorization to $15 billion. We expect to execute $3 billion of the remaining $9 billion of our share repurchase program in 2019. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” Since our share repurchase program began in November 2016, we have repurchased 111 million shares at a cost of $6.1 billion through December 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, we made a $600 million contribution to our domestic qualified pension plan, which is included in the “Other” line in the “Cash Flows From Operating Activities” section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. This additional contribution lowered our domestic pension deficit, thereby reducing 2018 premiums charged by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 62 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2018: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years2–3 Years4–5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 14,191 33 159 987 13,012 Capital lease obligations (b) 777 79 155 143 400 Total debt 14,968 112 314 1,130 13,412 Interest on debt and other obligations 12,213 865 1,710 1,634 8,004 Operating lease obligations (c) 1,394 248 561 373 212 Purchase obligations (d) 9,703 4,000 1,854 1,422 2,427 Other long-term liabilities Pension and postretirement benefit contributions (e) 1,519 380 634 505 – Asset retirement obligations (f) 7,908 378 672 681 6,177 Accrued environmental costs (g) 178 20 28 26 104 Unrecognized tax benefits (h) 115 115 (h) (h) (h) Total $ 47,998 6,118 5,773 5,771 30,336 (a) Includes $220 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs.

(c) Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $3,412 million. Purchase obligations of $5,169 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2019 through 2023. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2023, see Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. 63 Table of Contents (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $966 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars 2018 2017 2016 Alaska $ 1,298 815 883 Lower 48 3,184 2,136 1,262 Canada 477 202 698 Europe and North Africa 877 872 1,020 Asia Pacific and Middle East 718 482 838 Other International 6 21 104 Corporate and Other 190 63 64 Capital Program $ 6,750 4,591 4,869 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, totaled $16.2 billion. The 2018 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: • Development, appraisal and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware in the Permian Basin. • Leasehold acquisition and exploration, appraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North Slope; development activities in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area. • Development activities in Europe, including the Greater Ekofisk Area, Clair Ridge and Aasta Hansteen. • Leasehold acquisition, optimization of oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in Canada. • Continued development in China, Australia, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and exploration and appraisal activities in Malaysia. 2019 CAPITAL BUDGET In December 2018, we announced a 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion which includes funding for ongoing conventional and unconventional development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, and base maintenance activities. We are planning to allocate approximately: • 70 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware, as well as development drilling in Alaska, Canada and Europe. • 15 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures. • 10 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on major projects in Alaska, China, Australia, Europe and Malaysia. • 5 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to new exploration activity, primarily in Alaska and the Lower 48. 64 Table of Contents For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. 65 Table of Contents • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by 66 Table of Contents private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2018, there were 14 sites around the United States in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $442 million in 2018 and are expected to be about $530 million per year in 2019 and 2020. Capitalized environmental costs were $191 million in 2018 and are expected to be about $240 million per year in 2019 and 2020. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2018, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $178 million, compared with $180 million at December 31, 2017, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. 67 Table of Contents These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2018 was approximately $5.6 million (net share before-tax). • The Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (CCIR) requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity. The total cost of these regulations in 2018 was approximately $4 million. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former U.S. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2018 was approximately $30 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta Operations totaling just over $0.6 million (net share before-tax). • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. While the United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the United States will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the United States. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). 68 Table of Contents • The GHG reductions required. • The price and availability of offsets. • The amount and allocation of allowances. • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The company has responded by putting in place a Sustainable Development Risk Management Practice covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence. A corporate Climate Change Action Plan has been developed to track mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register. The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action Plan fall into four broad categories: • GHG-related legislation and regulation. • GHG emissions management. • Physical climate-related impacts. • Climate-related disclosure and reporting. The company uses a range of estimated future costs of GHG emissions for internal planning purposes, including an estimated market cost of GHG emissions of $40 per metric tonne applied beginning in the year 2024 to evaluate certain future projects and opportunities. The company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations. In December 2018, we became a Founding Member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans for Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, a state government, and a trade association in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island and Maryland, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, Inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The lawsuits brought by the Cities of San Francisco, Oakland and New York have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities. 69 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASU No. 2016-02), which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. This ASU supersedes the existing requirements in FASB ASC Topic 840, “Leases” (FASB ASC Topic 840), and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2016-02 was amended in January 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” (ASU No. 2018-01), and in July 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (ASU No. 2018-10). In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 was further amended in July 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (ASU No. 2018-11), and in December 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-20, “Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors” (ASU No. 2018-20). ASU No. 2018-11 sets forth certain additional practical expedients for lessors and provides entities with an option to apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the ASU’s effective date of adoption (the “Optional Transition Method”). Entities that elect to utilize the Optional Transition Method would not apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to comparative periods presented in the financial statements. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the Optional Transition Method. Accordingly, the comparative periods presented in the financial statements prior to January 1, 2019, will be presented pursuant to the existing requirements of FASB ASC Topic 840 and not be adjusted upon the adoption of the ASU. We also expect to utilize the package of optional transition-related practical expedients set forth by ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, which permit entities to not reassess upon the adoption of the ASU certain historical conclusions regarding lease contract identification and classification, as well as the historical accounting treatment of initial direct costs (the “Package of Optional Practical Expedients”). For lease arrangements containing both lease and non-lease components, we will adopt the optional practical expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease components for all new or modified leases executed on or after the effective date of the ASU, subject to making any elections for leases after the effective date in new asset classes. Furthermore, we do not expect to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for new or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less. The expected impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, relates primarily to our balance sheet, resulting from the initial recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for our existing population of operating leases, as well as enhanced disclosure of our leasing arrangements. We expect to recognize on our consolidated balance sheet approximately $1 billion of operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended. We have implemented a third-party lease accounting software solution to facilitate the ongoing accounting and financial reporting requirements of the ASU and also expect the adoption of the ASU to result in certain changes being made to our existing accounting policies and systems, business processes, and internal controls. While our evaluation of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, and related implementation activities approach completion, we continue to monitor proposals issued by the FASB to clarify the ASU. For additional information, see Note 26—New Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2018, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $468 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $153 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 71 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately two years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, before-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2019 would increase by approximately $7 million. At year-end 2018, the remaining $3.6 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $2.6 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2019. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. 71 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2018, total suspended well costs were $856 million, compared with $853 million at year-end 2017. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. 72 Table of Contents Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2018, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $37 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2018 was approximately $5.5 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.0 billion BOE at the end of 2017 and 3.3 billion BOE at the end of 2018. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2018 would have increased by an estimated $611 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 73 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,000 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $110 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net 74 Table of Contents actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” 75 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. • The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. • Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities. • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development, or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development in a timely manner (if at all) or on budget. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks, and information technology failures, constraints or disruptions. • Changes in international monetary conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 76 Table of Contents • Changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids and any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business. • Reduced demand for our products or the use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources. • Substantial investment in and development of alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; the impact of and uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from the European Union; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments. • Volatility in the commodity futures markets. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business, including changes resulting from the implementation and interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. • Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. • Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital, including as a result of illiquidity or uncertainty in domestic or international financial markets. • Our inability to execute, or delays in the completion, of any asset dispositions or acquisitions we elect to pursue. • Potential failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, any necessary regulatory approvals for asset dispositions or acquisitions or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or the operation of our remaining business. • Potential disruption of our operations as a result of asset dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of management time and attention. • Our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions we undertake in the manner and timeframe we currently anticipate, if at all. • Our inability to liquidate the common stock issued to us by Cenovus Energy as part of our sale of certain assets in western Canada at prices we deem acceptable, or at all. • The operation and financing of our joint ventures. • The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us, including our inability to collect payments when due under our ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA. • Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions. • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any additional risks described in our other filings with the SEC. 77 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 78 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date FixedRateMaturity AverageInterestRate FloatingRateMaturity AverageInterestRate Year-End 2018 2019 $ 17 - % $ - - % 2020 - - - - 2021 123 9.13 - - 2022 343 2.54 500 3.52 2023 106 7.20 - - Remaining years 12,599 6.16 283 1.78 Total $ 13,188 $ 783 Fair value $ 15,364 $ 783 Year-End 2017 2018 $ 2,250 3.31 % $ 250 1.75 % 2019 23 - - - 2020 - - - - 2021 150 9.13 - - 2022 1,014 2.45 500 2.32 Remaining years 14,207 6.00 283 1.70 Total $ 17,644 $ 1,033 Fair value $ 21,402 $ 1,033 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps and options for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards, swaps and options hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding foreign currency zero-cost collars buying the right to sell $1.25 billion Canadian dollars (CAD) at $0.707 CAD and selling the right to buy $1.25 billion CAD at $0.842 CAD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was a before-tax gain of $6 million and a before-tax loss of $9 million, respectively. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2018 and December 2017 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $17 million and $74 million respectively. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. 79 Table of Contents The gross notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair MarketValue** 2018 2017 2018 2017 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 805 - (5) - Sell Canadian dollar, buy U.S. dollar CAD 1,250 1,250 6 (9 ) Buy Canadian dollar, sell U.S. dollar CAD 8 25 - 1 Sell British pound, buy Norwegian krone GBP 9 - - - Sell British pound, buy euro GBP 12 1 - - *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD) and British pound (GBP) . **Denominated in U.S. dollars.

The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an independent E&P company with operations and activities in 17 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; LNG developments; oil sands in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 10,400 people worldwide and had total assets of $71 billion. Overview Global oil prices continued to be volatile in 2019. Optimism about worldwide economic growth during the first quarter turned to pessimism in the second quarter as trade disputes dampened growth forecasts. At the end of the second quarter, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, threatening the safe passage of supertankers carrying crude oil through the Persian Gulf, revived oil prices. Worldwide economic growth concerns returned in the third quarter to depress prices, only to be reversed again by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as oilfield infrastructure in Saudi Arabia was attacked, temporarily disrupting approximately five percent of the world’s oil supply. Production was restored relatively quickly, and prices settled in the fourth quarter. Brent crude averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, down nine percent from the prior year. Our business strategy anticipates prices will remain volatile and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, while retaining upside during periods of higher prices. Portfolio diversification and optimization, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital investment have positioned our company to navigate through volatile energy cycles. Our value proposition principles, namely, to focus on financial returns, maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver compelling returns of capital, and expand cash flow through disciplined capital investments, are being executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business. These priorities are: invest capital to sustain production and pay our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; maintain debt at a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating through price cycles; allocate greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to share repurchases and dividends; and, invest capital in a disciplined fashion to grow our cash from operations. We believe our commitment to our value proposition, as evidenced by the results discussed below, positions us for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility. 36 In 2019, we successfully delivered on our priorities. We achieved production growth of five percent on a total BOE basis compared with the prior year, with higher value oil volumes growing eight percent. Cash provided by operating activities of $11.1 billion exceeded capital expenditures and investments of $6.6 billion. After repurchasing $3.5 billion of our common stock and paying $1.5 billion of dividends to shareholders, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $5.4 billion and $3.0 billion of short-term investments. In October, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share and announced planned 2020 share buybacks of $3 billion. In February 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance. Capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in Alaska. This guidance does not include capital for acquisitions. Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2019 included the following: ● Net cash provided by operating activities was $11.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures and investments of $6.6 billion. ● Repurchased $3.5 billion of shares and paid $1.5 billion in dividends, representing 45 percent of net cash provided by operating activities. ● Increased the quarterly dividend by 38 percent to $0.42 per share . ● Achieved 100 percent total reserve replacement and 117 percent organic replacement. ● Underlying production, which excludes Libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 MBOED in 2019 and 47 MBOED in 2018, grew 5 percent . ● Increased production from the Lower 48 Big 3 unconventionals—Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian Unconventional—by 22 percent year-over-year. ● Executed successful Alaska appraisal program; conducted appraisal drilling and commissioned infrastructure at Montney in Canada. ● Completed Lower 48, Alaska and Argentina acquisitions; awarded a 20-year extension of the Indonesia Corridor Block PSC, with new terms. ● Generated $3 billion in disposition proceeds; entered into agreements to sell Australia-West assets for $1.4 billion and Niobrara for $0.4 billion, both subject to customary closing adjustments, as well as regulatory and other approvals. ● Reduced asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs by $2.3 billion, primarily due to closed and pending dispositions. ● Ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $ 5.4 billion and short-term investments of $3.0 billion. ● Recognized a $296 million after-tax impairment related to the sale of our Niobrara interests in the Lower 48 segment. ● Discontinued exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk trend and recognized $197 million after-tax in leasehold impairment and dry hole expenses. Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing our operating plan and maintaining capital and cost discipline. Production of 1,348 MBOED increased 5 percent or 65 MBOED in 2019 compared with 2018. Production, excluding Libya, of 1,305 MBOED increased 5 percent or 63 MBOED. Underlying production, which excludes Libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 MBOED in 2019 and 47 MBOED in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically. Our underlying production grew 5 percent in 2019 to 1,254 MBOED from 1,195 MBOED in 2018. On September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited for proceeds of $2.2 billion after interest and customary adjustments. In 2019, we recorded a $1.7 billion before-tax and $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with this transaction. Together the subsidiaries 37 sold our indirectly held exploration and production assets in the U.K., including $1.8 billion of ARO. Annualized average production associated with the U.K. assets sold was 50 MBOED in 2019. Reserves associated with the U.K. assets sold were 84 MMBOE at the time of disposition. Results of operations for the U.K. are reported within our Europe and North Africa segment. In the second quarter of 2019, we completed the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the government of Timor-Leste for $350 million and recognized an after-tax gain of $52 million. No production or reserve impacts were associated with the sale. The Greater Sunrise Fields were included in our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. In October 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our Australia-West assets and operations to Santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2019. In addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the Barossa development project. These subsidiaries hold our 37.5 percent interest in the Barossa Project and Caldita Field, our 56.9 percent interest in the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu-Undan Field, our 40 percent interest in the Greater Poseidon Fields, and our 50 percent interest in the Athena Field. This transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other specific conditions precedent. In 2019, production associated with the Australia-West assets to be sold was 48 MBOED. Year -end 2019 reserves associated with these assets were 17 MMBOE. We will retain our 37.5 percent interest in the Australia Pacific LNG project and operatorship of that project’s LNG facility. Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the Niobrara shale play for $380 million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells. We recorded an after-tax impairment of $296 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to reduce the carrying value to fair value. In 2019, production from Niobrara was 11 MBOED. Year -end 2019 reserves associated with the Niobrara assets to be sold were 14 MMBOE. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The Niobrara results of operations are reported within our Lower 48 segment. For more information regarding the accounting impacts of these transactions, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Environment Brent crude oil prices averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from a low of $53 per barrel in January to a high of almost $75 per barrel in April. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the foundational principles that underpin our value proposition; focus on financial returns through cash flow expansion, maintain balance sheet strength and deliver peer-leading distributions. Operational and Financial Factors Affecting Profitability The focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include: ● Maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on November 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our GHG emission intensity by 2030. In December 2018, we became a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and 38 environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. In early 2019, we issued our first stand-alone Climate-related Risk Report and incorporated this into our website during our annual Sustainability Report update. Our sustainability efforts continued through 2019 with a focus on advancing our action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved HSE and operational performance. ● Focus on financial returns. This is a core principle of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and continually optimizing our portfolio. o Maintain capital allocation discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low production decline. Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price related inflation and G&A. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using this cost of supply criteria, which should lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth’s sake. Additional capital may be allocated toward growth, but discipline will be maintained. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend. In February 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance. Capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in Alaska. This guidance does not include capital for acquisitions. o Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. In 2019, our production and operating expenses were two percent higher than 2018, primarily due to costs associated with higher production volumes, which grew five percent during the same period. o Optimize our portfolio. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio to focus on low cost of supply assets that support our strategy. In 2019, we continued to dispose of or market certain non-core assets, including the U.K., Australia-West and our Niobrara assets in the Lower 48. Additions to the portfolio were made in the Lower 48 with bolt-on interests and acreage acquisitions, in Alaska with the Nuna discovery acreage acquisition, and internationally with entrance into Argentina’s Neuquén and Austral Basins. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments. 39 ● Maintain balance sheet strength. We believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. Our strong operating performance buffered by a solid balance sheet enables us to deliver on our priorities through the price cycles. Our priorities include execution of our development plans, maintaining a growing dividend, and repurchasing shares on a dollar cost average basis. ● Return value to shareholders. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend supplemented by share repurchases. In 2019, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.5 billion and repurchased $3.5 billion of our common stock. Combined, our dividend and repurchases represented 45 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. Since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased $9.6 billion of shares. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $15 billion share repurchase program our Board of Directors had authorized. In February 2020, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from $15 billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” In October 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share. ● Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Purchases of increased interests in existing fields and bolt-on acquisitions. Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. In 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 100 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for approximately 55 percent of the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019. Approximately 50 percent of organic reserve additions were from Lower 48 unconventional assets. The remaining additions were evenly distributed across the other operating segments. In the five years ended December 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was negative 34 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended December 31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 2.0 billion BOE related to sales and purchases, was 40 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period. Historically, our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production. In the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays. Accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis. In the three years ended December 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion BOE related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities. 40 Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. ● Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. We have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to work and operate more efficiently. Predictive analytics have been adopted in our operations and planning process. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are being used for seismic advancements. ● Attract, develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. We offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best early career talent. We also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad range of expertise and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. Other Factors Affecting Profitability Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: ● Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. Industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: 41 Brent crude oil prices averaged $64.30 per barrel in 2019, a decrease of 9 percent compared with $71.04 per barrel in 2018. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 12 percent from $64.92 per barrel in 2018 to $57.02 per barrel in 2019. Crude oil prices weakened year over year primarily due to ample global supplies and a decelerating global economy. Henry Hub natural gas price averages decreased 15 percent from $3.09 per MMBTU in 2018 to $2.63 per MMBTU in 2019. Natural gas prices weakened in 2019 versus the prior year due to strong production, while demand growth was dampened by mild weather. Our realized NGL prices decreased 34 percent from $30.48 per barrel in 2018 to $20.09 per barrel in 2019. NGL prices weakened year over year due to strong supply growth with only moderate demand growth. Our realized bitumen price increased 42 percent from $22.29 per barrel in 2018 to $31.72 per barrel in 2019. Curtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government, which limited production from the province starting January 2019, provided strength to the WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through the utilization of downstream transportation solutions and implementation of alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs. Our worldwide annual average realized price decreased 9 percent from $53.88 per BOE in 2018 to $48.78 per BOE in 2019 due to lower realized oil, natural gas and NGL prices. North America’s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the U.S. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible. ● Impairments. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. At times, our PP&E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. A sustained decline in the current and long-term outlook on gas price could affect the carrying value of certain Lower 48 non-core gas assets and it is reasonably possible this could result in a future non-cash impairment. For additional information on our impairments in 2019, 2018 and 2017, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Effective tax rate. Our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. ● Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to 42 increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity. Outlook Full-year 2020 production is expected to be 1,230 MBOED to 1,270 MBOED, including the impact of a recent third-party pipeline outage on the Kebabangan Field in Malaysia. First-quarter 2020 production is expected to be 1,240 MBOED to 1,280 MBOED. Production guidance for 2020 excludes Libya. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production. 43 RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis section of the Form 10-K discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. For discussion of year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our 2018 10-K.Consolidated ResultsA summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows:Millions of DollarsYears Ended December 31201920182017Alaska$1,5201,8141,466Lower 484361,747(2,371)Canada279632,564Europe and North Africa2,7241,866553Asia Pacific and Middle East1,9292,070(1,098)Other International263364167Corporate and Other38(1,667)(2,136)Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips$7,1896,257(855) 2019 vs. 2018 Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips increased $932 million in 2019. The increase was mainly due to: ● A $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited. ● An unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2019, as compared to a $436 million after-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018. ● Higher crude oil sales volumes due to growth in the Lower 48 unconventionals and from the acquisition of incremental interests in operated assets in Alaska during the second and fourth quarters of 2018. ● The absence of premiums on early debt retirements totaling $195 million after-tax. ● A $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits recognized for Malaysia Block G. ● A $151 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules relating to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These increases in net income were partly offset by: ● Lower realized crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices. ● The absence of a $774 million after-tax gain on the Clair disposition in the U.K. ● A $296 million after-tax impairment related to the sale of our Lower 48 Niobrara interests. ● Lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to $120 million of impairments to equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment and a $118 million reduction in equity earnings at QG3 in our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment due to a deferred tax adjustment. ● Higher exploration expenses, primarily in our Lower 48 segment due to $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk trend. 44 Income Statement Analysis 2019 vs. 2018 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 11 percent in 2019, mainly due to lower realized crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, partly offset by higher sales volumes of crude oil in the Lower 48 and Alaska. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $295 million in 2019, primarily due to impairments of equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment totaling $155 million. Additionally, equity earnings decreased $118 million resultant from a deferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. For more information related to these items, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities and Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on dispositions increased $903 million in 2019, primarily due to a $1.7 billion before-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited. Partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of a $715 million before-tax gain on the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP in 2018, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the U.K. For additional information related to these dispositions, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased $1,185 million in 2019, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million before-tax on our CVE common shares in 2019, and the absence of a $437 million before-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018. For discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 17 percent in 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $155 million in 2019, primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and benefits, including mark to market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs, and increased facility costs. Exploration expenses increased $374 million in 2019, primarily due to higher leasehold impairment and dry hole costs, mainly in our Lower 48 segment, and higher exploration G&A expenses. In 2019, we recorded a $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment expense due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk trend and expensed $111 million of dry hole costs related to this play. Impairments increased $378 million in 2019, mainly due to a $379 million before-tax impairment related to the sale of our Niobrara interests in the Lower 48 segment. For additional information, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expenses decreased $310 million in 2019, primarily due to the absence of a $206 million before-tax expense for premiums on early debt retirements and lower pension settlement expense. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate. 45 Summary Operating Statistics201920182017Average Net ProductionCrude oil (MBD)705653599Natural gas liquids (MBD)115102111Bitumen (MBD)6066122Natural gas (MMCFD)2,8052,7743,270Total Production (MBOED)1,3481,2831,377Dollars Per UnitAverage Sales Prices Crude oil (per bbl)$60.9968.1351.96Natural gas liquids (per bbl)20.0930.4825.22Bitumen (per bbl)31.7222.2922.66Natural gas (per mcf)5.035.654.07Millions of DollarsWorldwide Exploration ExpensesGeneral and administrative; geological and geophysical,lease rental, and other$322274368Leasehold impairment22156136Dry holes20039430$743369934 We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2019, our operations were producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. 2019 vs. 2018 Total production, including Libya, of 1,348 MBOED increased 65 MBOED or 5 percent in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to: ● New wells online in the Lower 48. ● An increased interest in the Western North Slope (WNS) and Greater Kuparuk Area (GKA) of Alaska following acquisitions closed in 2018. ● Higher production in Norway due to drilling activity and the startup of Aasta Hansteen in December 2018. The increase in production during 2019 was partly offset by: ● Normal field decline. ● Disposition impacts from the U.K. and non-core asset sales in the Lower 48. Production excluding Libya was 1,305 MBOED in 2019 compared with 1,242 MBOED in 2018, an increase of 63 MBOED or 5 percent. Underlying production, which excludes Libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 MBOED in 2019 and 47 MBOED in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically. Our underlying production grew 5 percent to 1,254 MBOED in 2019 from 1,195 MBOED in 2018. 46 Alaska201920182017Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars)$1,5201,8141,466Average Net ProductionCrude oil (MBD)202171167Natural gas liquids (MBD)151414Natural gas (MMCFD)767Total Production (MBOED)218186182Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per bbl)$64.1270.8653.33Natural gas (per mcf)3.192.482.72 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. In 2019, Alaska contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production. 2019 vs. 2018 Alaska reported earnings of $1,520 million in 2019, compared with earnings of $1,814 million in 2018. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher production and operating and DD&A expenses associated with incremental volumes from acquisitions completed during 2018. Additionally, earnings were lower due to the absence of a $98 million tax valuation allowance reduction, the absence of a $79 million after-tax benefit resulting from an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the FERC, and $62 million less in enhanced oil recovery credits. Partly offsetting these decreases in earnings, were higher crude oil sales volumes due to the GKA and WNS acquisitions completed in 2018. Average production increased 32 MBOED in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to acquisitions at GKA and WNS in 2018, which provided an incremental 38 MBOED of production in 2019, as well as volumes from new wells online. These production increases were partly offset by normal field decline. Acquisition Update In the third quarter of 2019, we completed the Nuna discovery acreage acquisition for approximately $100 million, expanding the Kuparuk River Unit by 21,000 acres and leveraging legacy infrastructure. 47 Lower 48201920182017Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars)$4361,747(2,371)Average Net ProductionCrude oil (MBD)266229180Natural gas liquids (MBD)816969Natural gas (MMCFD)622596898Total Production (MBOED)451397399Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per bbl)$55.3062.9947.36Natural gas liquids (per bbl)16.8327.3022.20Natural gas (per mcf)2.122.822.73 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2019, the Lower 48 contributed 39 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 22 percent of our natural gas production. 2019 vs. 2018 Lower 48 reported earnings of $436 million in 2019, compared with $1,747 million in 2018. Earnings decreased primarily due to lower realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices; higher DD&A due to increased production volumes; a $301 million after-tax impairment of our Niobrara assets; higher exploration expenses, primarily due to a combined $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk; and lower earnings in equity affiliates due to a combined $120 million after-tax of impairments associated with a fair value reduction of our investment in MWCC and the disposition of our interests in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline. Partly offsetting the decrease in earnings were increased crude oil and NGL sales volumes in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian Unconventional. For additional information related to our impairment of MWCC, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information related to the sale of our interests in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total average production increased 54 MBOED in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to new production from unconventional assets in Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, partly offset by normal field decline. Additionally, production decreased by 10 MBOED due to non-core dispositions in 2018. Asset Dispositions Update In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline. We have also entered into agreements to amend our contractual obligations for retaining use of the facilities. As a result of entering into these agreements, we recognized a before-tax impairment of $60 million in the first quarter of 2019 which is included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line on our consolidated income statement. We completed the sale in the second quarter of 2019. See Note 15—Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our interests in the Magnolia field and platform and recognized an after- 48 tax gain of $63 million. Production from Magnolia in 2019 was less than one MBOED. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the Niobrara shale play for $380 million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells. We recorded an after-tax impairment of $301 million in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Production from Niobrara was approximately 11 MBOED in 2019. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. In January 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain non-core properties in the Lower 48 segment for $186 million, plus customary adjustments. The assets met the held for sale criteria in January 2020 and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. No gain or loss is anticipated on the sale. This disposition will not have a significant impact on Lower 48 production. For additional information on these transactions, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our Canadian operations consist of the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta and the liquids-rich Montney unconventional play in British Columbia. In 2019, Canada contributed 7 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than one percent of our worldwide natural gas production. 2019 vs. 2018 Canada operations reported earnings of $279 million in 2019 compared with $63 million in 2018. Earnings increased mainly due to higher realized bitumen prices, a $68 million tax benefit primarily comprised of a previously unrecognizable tax basis related to a tax settlement, lower DD&A expense due to lower rates from 49 reserve additions, lower production and operating expenses, and a $25 million tax benefit due to a four year phased four percent reduction in Alberta’s corporate income tax rate. Partly offsetting the increase in earnings were lower sales volumes due to a planned turnaround at Surmont, lower production due to a mandated production curtailment imposed by the Alberta government in January 2019, and the absence of an $80 million tax restructuring benefit. Total average production decreased 7 MBOED in 2019 compared with 2018. The production decrease was primarily due to a turnaround at Surmont, which had an annualized average impact of 3 MBOED, and a mandated production curtailment imposed by the Alberta government, which also impacted production by 3 MBOED. The curtailment program is established and administered by the Alberta Energy Regulator under the Curtailment Rules regulation, which is currently set to expire on December 31, 2020. This program is intended to strengthen the WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty. Asset Disposition On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction was $11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments, 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares and a five year uncapped contingent payment. The contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded after-tax gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of $84 million and $68 million, respectively. See Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

In 2019, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 16 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 17 percent of our natural gas production. 2019 vs. 2018 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $2,724 million increased $858 million in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase in earnings was primarily due to a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited. Earnings also increased due to the cessation of DD&A in the second quarter of 2019 for our disposed U.K. subsidiaries when these assets became held-for-sale. Partly offsetting the increase in earnings were the absence of a $774 million 50 after-tax gain related to the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the U.K.; lower sales volumes primarily due to the U.K. disposition to Chrysaor completed September 30, 2019; and lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Average production decreased 17 MBOED in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was mainly due to normal field decline and a 20 MBOED disposition impact from the sale of our U.K. assets to Chrysaor completed September 30, 2019. Partly offsetting these production decreases were volumes from new wells online in Norway, including the Aasta Hansteen Field which achieved first production in December of 2018. Asset Disposition Update On September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited for proceeds of $2.2 billion after interest and customary adjustments. In 2019, we recorded a $1.7 billion before-tax and $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with this transaction. Together the subsidiaries sold indirectly held our exploration and production assets in the U.K., including $1.8 billion of ARO. Annualized average production associated with the U.K. assets sold was 50 MBOED in 2019. Reserves associated with the U.K. assets sold were 84 MMBOE at the time of disposition. For additional information, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Asia Pacific and Middle East201920182017Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars)$1,9292,070(1,098)Average Net ProductionCrude oil (MBD)Consolidated operations858993Equity affiliates131414Total crude oil98103107Natural gas liquids (MBD)Consolidated operations434Equity affiliates877Total natural gas liquids121011Natural gas (MMCFD)Consolidated operations637626687Equity affiliates1,0521,0311,007Total natural gas1,6891,6571,694Total Production (MBOED)392389401Average Sales Prices Crude oil (dollars per bbl)Consolidated operations$65.0270.9354.38Equity affiliates61.3272.4954.76Total crude oil64.5271.1454.43Natural gas liquids (dollars per bbl)Consolidated operations37.8547.2041.37Equity affiliates36.7045.6938.74Total natural gas liquids37.1046.1339.75Natural gas (dollars per mcf)Consolidated operations5.916.154.98Equity affiliates6.296.064.27Total natural gas6.156.094.55 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar. During 2019, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 60 percent of our natural gas production. 2019 vs. 2018 Asia Pacific and Middle East reported earnings of $1,929 million in 2019, compared with $2,070 million in 2018. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices; lower LNG and crude oil sales volumes; and lower equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to a deferred tax adjustment at QG3 that resulted in a $118 million reduction to equity earnings. Partly offsetting this decrease in earnings was a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits from the Malaysia Block G and a $52 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields. 52 Average production increased 1 percent in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to new production from Malaysia, including first gas supply from KBB to PFLNG1 in the second quarter of 2019 and first oil from Gumusut Phase 2 in the third quarter of 2019; and new wells online in China, including Bohai Phase 3. Partly offsetting this production increase was normal field decline. Asset Dispositions Update In the second quarter of 2019, we recognized an after-tax gain of $52 million upon completion of the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the government of Timor-Leste for $350 million. No production or reserve impacts were associated with the sale. In October 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our Australia-West assets and operations to Santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2019. In addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the Barossa development project. These subsidiaries hold our 37.5 percent interest in the Barossa Project and Caldita Field, our 56.9 percent interest in the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu-Undan Field, our 40 percent interest in the Greater Poseidon Fields, and our 50 percent interest in the Athena Field. This transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other specific conditions precedent. In 2019, production associated with the Australia-West assets to be sold was 48 MBOED. Year -end 2019 reserves associated with these assets were 17 MMBOE. We will retain our 37.5 percent interest in the Australia Pacific LNG project and operatorship of that project’s LNG facility. See Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to these dispositions. Other International201920182017Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips(millions of dollars)$263364167 The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia, Chile and Argentina and contingencies associated with prior operations. 2019 vs. 2018 Other International operations reported earnings of $263 million in 2019, compared with earnings of $364 million in 2018. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the recognition of $417 million after-tax in other income related to a settlement agreement with PDVSA in 2018, compared with $317 million after-tax associated with this settlement agreement in 2019. In 2018 and 2019, we collected approximately $0.8 billion of the $2.0 billion settlement with PDVSA. PDVSA has defaulted on its remaining payment obligations under this agreement, we are therefore now forced to incur additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the agreement. For additional information, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Argentina In January 2019, we secured a 50 percent nonoperated interest in the El Turbio Este Block, within the Austral Basin in southern Argentina. In 2019, we acquired and processed 3-D seismic covering 500 square miles, with evaluation of the data ongoing. In November 2019, we acquired interests in two nonoperated blocks in the Neuquén Basin targeting the Vaca Muerta play. We have a 50 percent interest in the Bandurria Norte Block and a 45 percent interest in the Aguada Federal Block. In Bandurria Norte, 1 vertical and 4 horizontal wells were tested and shut-in during 2019. In Aguada Federal, 2 horizontal wells were being tested at the end of the year. 53 Corporate and OtherMillions of Dollars201920182017Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillipsNet interest$(604)(680)(739)Corporate general and administrative expenses(252)(91)(193)Technology12310920Other771(1,005)(1,224)$38(1,667)(2,136) 2019 vs. 2018 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased $76 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects; increased interest income from holding higher cash balances; and lower interest on debt expense resultant from the retirement of $4.7 billion of debt in 2018; partly offset by the absence of an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the FERC. Corporate G&A expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These costs increased by $161 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and benefits, including certain key employee compensation programs and higher facility costs. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery and LNG. Earnings from Technology increased by $14 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to higher licensing revenues. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense. Earnings in “Other” increased by $1,776 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our CVE common shares in 2019, and the absence of a $436 million after-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018. Additionally, earnings increased due to the absence of $195 million in premiums on the early retirement of debt, lower pension settlement expense, and a $151 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 54 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial IndicatorsMillions of DollarsExcept as Indicated201920182017Net cash provided by operating activities$11,10412,9347,077Cash and cash equivalents5,0885,9156,325Short-term debt1051122,575Total debt14,89514,96819,703Total equity35,05032,06430,801Percent of total debt to capital*30%3239Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt5%55*Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2019, the primary uses of our available cash were $6,636 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $3,500 million to repurchase our common stock; $2,910 million net purchases of investments, and $1,500 million to pay dividends on our common stock. During 2019, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $827 million to $5,088 million. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments. Our commitment to disciplined execution of these funding requirements includes cash investment strategies that position us for success in an environment of short-term price volatility as well as extended downturns in commodity prices. The primary objectives of these cash investment strategies in priority order are to protect principal, maintain liquidity, and provide yield and total returns. Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. For additional information, see Note 1–Accounting Policies and Note 14–Derivative and Financial Instruments. Significant Changes in Capital Operating Activities During 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $11,104 million, a 14 percent decrease from 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices, lower collections related to settlements reached with Ecuador and PDVSA, and a pension contribution made in conjunction with the sale of two U.K. subsidiaries, partially offset by higher volumes. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 55 The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged 1,348 MBOED in 2019. Full-year production excluding Libya averaged 1,305 MBOED in 2019 and is expected to be 1,230 to 1,270 MBOED in 2020. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. In 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 100 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for approximately 55 percent of the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019. Approximately 51 percent of organic reserve additions are from Lower 48, 13 percent from Alaska, 12 percent from Canada, 12 percent from Europe and North Africa and 12 percent from Asia Pacific and Middle East. In the five years ended December 31, 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a decrease of 2.0 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was negative 34 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended December 31, 2019, was 40 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period. Historically our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production. In the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays. Accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis. In the three years ended December 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion BOE related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our 2020 capital budget, see the “2020 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. We have reported revisions as increases to reserves in the current period, however in prior periods, reported revisions as decreases to reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities Proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion. We completed the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries to Chrysaor E&P Limited for $2.2 billion. We also completed the sale of several assets including our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields for $350 million and received $106 million of contingent payments from Cenovus Energy. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our Australia-West assets and operations to Santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments. In addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the Barossa development project. Also in the fourth 56 quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the Niobrara shale play for $380 million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells. Both transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. Investing activities in 2019 also included net purchases of $2.9 billion of investments in short-term and long-term financial instruments. These investments include time deposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. The investment in short-term instruments was $2.8 billion, the remaining $0.1 billion was invested in long-term debt securities. For additional information, see Note 14–Derivative and Financial Instruments. Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 were $1.1 billion. We completed several undeveloped acreage transactions in our Lower 48 segment for a total of $267 million after customary adjustments and another transaction in our Lower 48 segment for $112 million after customary adjustments. We completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after customary adjustments. We also completed the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP and received $253 million net proceeds. The subsidiary held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the U.K. During 2018, we received $95 million of contingent payments from Cenovus Energy. For additional information on our dispositions, see Note 5—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities We have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the U.S. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips Company $6.0 billion commercial paper program, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We had no commercial paper outstanding in programs in place at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. We had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2019. Our current long-term debt ratings remained unchanged in 2019 and are as follows: Fitch - “A” with a “stable” outlook; Moody’s Investors Services - “A3” with a “stable” outlook; and Standard & Poor’s - “A” with a stable outlook. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters 57 of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had direct bank letters of credit of $277 million and $323 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. For information about guarantees, see Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2019, was $14,895 million, a decrease of $73 million from the balance at December 31, 2018. For more information on Debt, see Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 30, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019. On May 1, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share. The dividend was paid on June 3, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 13, 2019. On July 11, 2019, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.305 per share. The dividend was paid on September 3, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 22, 2019. On October 7, 2019, we announced a 38 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share. The dividend was paid on December 2, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 17, 2019. In February 2020, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, payable March 2, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2020. In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2019, we had announced a total authorization to repurchase $15 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $3 billion in 2017, $3 billion in 2018 and $3.5 billion in 2019. Of the remaining authorization, we expect to repurchase $3 billion in 2020. In February 2020, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase to our authorization from $15 billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors -“Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” Since our share repurchase program began in November 2016, we have repurchased 169 million shares at a cost of $9.6 billion through December 31, 2019. 58 Contractual ObligationsThe table below summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2019: Millions of DollarsPayments Due by Period Up to 1YearsYearsAfterTotal Year2–34–55 Years Debt obligations (a)$14,175181,01860512,534Finance lease obligations (b)72087157141335Total debt14,8951051,17574612,869Interest on debt11,3398561,6711,6037,209Operating lease obligations (c)1,050379377145149Purchase obligations (d)8,6713,2371,7451,3272,362Other long-term liabilitiesPension and postretirement benefit contributions (e)1,375440540395-Asset retirement obligations (f)6,2069972823094,618Accrued environmental costs (g)17128332189Unrecognized tax benefits (h)8282(h)(h)(h)Total$43,7896,1245,8234,54627,296 (a) Includes $204 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 11—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) See Note 17—Non-Mineral Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (c) Includes $31 million of short-term leases that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 17—Non-Mineral Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (d) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $2,426 million. Purchase obligations of $5,111 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (e) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2020 through 2024. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2024, see Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (f) Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations. 59 (g) Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs. (h) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $1,095 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Expenditures and InvestmentsMillions of Dollars201920182017Alaska$1,5131,298815Lower 483,3943,1842,136Canada368477202Europe and North Africa708877872Asia Pacific and Middle East584718482Other International8621Corporate and Other6119063Capital Program$6,6366,7504,591 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, totaled $18.0 billion. The 2019 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: ● Development, appraisal and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Permian Unconventional, and Bakken. ● Appraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North Slope; development activities in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area; leasehold acquisition in the Greater Kuparuk Area. ● Development activities across assets in Norway, as well as for assets in the U.K. that recently have been sold. ● Optimization of oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in Canada. ● Signature bonus for Indonesia Corridor Block production sharing contract, as well as continued development in China, Malaysia, Australia, and Indonesia. 2020 CAPITAL BUDGET In February 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance. Capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in Alaska. This guidance does not include capital for acquisitions. For information on PUDs and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section in this report. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active 60 and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: ● U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. ● U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. ● European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). ● U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. ● U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. ● U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S. ● U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. 61 ● U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. ● U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. ● European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the U.S. and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2019, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible 62 parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $511 million in 2019 and are expected to be about $545 million per year in 2020 and 2021. Capitalized environmental costs were $194 million in 2019 and are expected to be about $225 million per year in 2020 and 2021. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2019, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $171 million, compared with $178 million at December 31, 2018, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. 63 Climate Change Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: ● European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2019 was approximately $8 million before-tax. ● The Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (CCIR) requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity. The total cost of these regulations in 2019 was approximately $4 million. ● The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. ● The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. ● The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former U.S. administration established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. ● Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2019 was approximately $30 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta Operations totaling just over $0.8 million (net share before-tax). ● The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. While the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the U.S. will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the U.S. In the U.S., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: ● Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. ● The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. 64 ● The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. ● The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). ● The GHG reductions required. ● The price and availability of offsets. ● The amount and allocation of allowances. ● Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. ● Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). ● Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. The company has responded by putting in place a Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence. We have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register. The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action Plan fall into four broad categories: ● GHG-related legislation and regulation. ● GHG emissions management. ● Physical climate-related impacts. ● Climate-related disclosure and reporting. Emissions are categorized into different scopes. Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions help us understand climate transition risk. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that we own or control. Scope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume. Our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to run a GHG pricing sensitivity using a corporate price of $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, plus annual inflation, for all Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions produced in 2024 and later. Projects in jurisdictions with existing GHG pricing regimes must incorporate that existing GHG price and its forecast into their base case economics. Where the existing GHG price is below the corporate price, the $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent sensitivity must also be run from 2024 onward. Thus, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making. The company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations. In December 2018, we became a founding member of the CLC, an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and a state government in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island and Maryland, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, Inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The lawsuits brought by the Cities of San Francisco, Oakland and New York have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending. Lawsuits filed by other cities and counties in California and Washington are currently stayed pending resolution of the appeals brought by the Cities of San Francisco and Oakland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Lawsuits filed in Maryland and Rhode Island are proceeding in state court while rulings in those matters, on the issue of whether the matters should proceed in state or federal court, are on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and First Circuit, respectively. 65 Several Louisiana parishes and individual landowners have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages in connection with historical oil and gas operations in Louisiana. All parish lawsuits are stayed pending an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of whether they will proceed in federal or state court. ConocoPhillips will vigorously defend against these lawsuits. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2019, the remaining $3.5 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $2.1 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2020, and $0.6 billion is held for sale. Management periodically assesses individually 66 significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2019, total suspended well costs were $1,020 million, compared with $856 million at year-end 2018. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production 67 will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2019, the net book value of productive PP&E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $35 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2019 was approximately $5.8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.3 billion BOE at the end of 2018 and 3.2 billion BOE at the end of 2019. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2019 would have increased by an estimated $642 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional 68 information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,000 million. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $100 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility 69 that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments. 70 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: ● Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. ● The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. ● Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. ● Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. ● Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. ● Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating E&P facilities. ● Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. ● Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. ● Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development, or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations. ● Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development in a timely manner (if at all) or on budget. ● Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, global health epidemics, terrorism, cyber attacks, and information technology failures, constraints or disruptions. ● Changes in international monetary conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 71 ● Changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, NGLs and any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business. ● Substantial investment in and development use of, competing or alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. ● Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation. ● Significant operational or investment changes imposed by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce GHG emissions. ● Liability resulting from litigation or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. ● General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs pricing, regulation or taxation; the impact of and uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s decision to withdraw from the EU; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments. ● Volatility in the commodity futures markets. ● Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business, including changes resulting from the implementation and interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ● Competition and consolidation in the oil and gas E&P industry. ● Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital, including as a result of illiquidity or uncertainty in domestic or international financial markets. ● Our inability to execute, or delays in the completion, of any asset dispositions or acquisitions we elect to pursue. ● Potential failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, any necessary regulatory approvals for asset dispositions or acquisitions, or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or the operation of our remaining business. ● Potential disruption of our operations as a result of asset dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of management time and attention. ● Our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions we undertake in the manner and timeframe we currently anticipate, if at all. ● Our inability to liquidate the common stock issued to us by Cenovus Energy as part of our sale of certain assets in western Canada at prices we deem acceptable, or at all. ● The operation and financing of our joint ventures. ● The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us, including our ability to collect payments when due from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA. ● Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions. ● The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any additional risks described in our other filings with the SEC. 72 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: ● Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. ● Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps and options for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards, swaps and options hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $1.35 billion CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding foreign currency zero-cost collars buying the right to sell $1.25 billion CAD at $0.707 CAD and selling the right to buy $1.25 billion CAD at $0.842 CAD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, was a before-tax loss of $28 million and a before-tax gain of $6 million, respectively. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2019 and December 2018 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $115 million and $17 million, respectively. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. 74 The gross notional and fair value of these positions at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange DerivativesNotional*Fair Value**2019201820192018Sell U.S. dollar, buy British poundUSD-805-(5)Sell Canadian dollar, buy U.S. dollarCAD1,3501,250(28)6Buy Canadian dollar, sell U.S. dollarCAD138--Sell British pound, buy Norwegian kroneGBP-9--Sell British pound, buy euroGBP-12--Buy British pound, sell euroGBP4--- *Denominated in USD, CAD and GBP. **Denominated in USD.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 33,800 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2008 had assets of $143 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating segments: • Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. • Midstream—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. • Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. • LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. • Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). • Emerging Businesses—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 33 Table of Contents In 2008, the energy industry was characterized by extreme volatility. Forecasts of worldwide economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S. dollar, and other factors helped drive crude oil prices to record highs. This was followed by an abrupt shift into a severe global financial recession, which reduced current and forecasted demand for petroleum products. Because of this, crude oil prices fell rapidly and refining margins also significantly weakened. As a result of the significant drop in global equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded two individually significant impairments in 2008 that were primarily linked to market capitalizations—a $25.4 billion write-down of our E&P segment’s recorded goodwill, and a $7.4 billion reduction in the carrying value of our LUKOIL investment. These impairments contributed to a net loss in 2008 of $17.0 billion, compared with net income in 2007 of $11.9 billion, which includes the impact of a $4.5 billion impairment due to expropriation of our Venezuelan assets. Since these 2008 and 2007 impairment charges were noncash, they did not impact our cash provided by operating activities, which was $22.7 billion in 2008, compared with $24.6 billion in 2007. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: • Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. The lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery due to economic conditions, as well as higher unplanned downtime including impacts from hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. • Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: • Successful exploration and development of new fields. • Acquisition of existing fields. • Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the three years ending December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent, including the impacts of the Burlington Resources acquisition, additional equity investments in LUKOIL, the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership with EnCana, the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with Origin Energy, and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. • Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our 34 Table of Contents industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. In response to the current depressed market environment, we expect to reduce our work force in 2009, reduce the headcount of contractors, and continue to emphasize cost discipline throughout our operations. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years and through the first half of 2008, and the subsequent increase in industry-wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies experienced inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs included rates for drilling rigs, steel and other raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. With the weakening of the economy and the decline in commodity prices, our industry began to see some relief from this upward cost pressure in late 2008 and into early 2009. • Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. In October 2008, we formed Australia Pacific LNG, a 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy for the development of coalbed natural gas in Australia, and the subsequent liquefaction and transport of the liquefied natural gas targeting Asia Pacific markets. In January 2007, we entered into two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana to create an integrated North American heavy oil business, consisting of the upstream FCCL Oil Sands Partnership in Canada and the downstream WRB Refining LLC in the United States. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2008 totaled $19.1 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $11.7 billion in 2009. The reduced capital budget in 2009 reflects the impact of the Origin transaction on the 2008 totals, and a planned reduction in response to current market conditions. In addition to our capital program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.9 billion in 2008, and repurchased $8.2 billion of our common stock. • Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. The 2006 Burlington Resources acquisition, the 2007 EnCana business ventures, and the 2008 Origin Energy joint venture are examples of such activity. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. In 2008, we completed the disposition of our retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and we also sold all of our E&P properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. We closed on the sale of a large part of our U.S. retail marketing assets in January 2009. • Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. 35 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: • Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2008, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL investment, totaled $1.7 billion. This amount compares with $0.4 billion of impairments, excluding the impairment of expropriated assets (discussed below), in 2007. • Goodwill. At year-end 2008, we had $3.8 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year-end 2007. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our E&P segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year-end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. For additional information, see Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations. • Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4.5 billion after-tax impairment (see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The company was also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009, so that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices. In October 2008, we and our co-venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan field, to allow the state-owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 36 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2008, compared with 2007, averaging $99.56 per barrel in 2008, an increase of 38 percent. The increase was driven by concerns during the first half of 2008 of adequate supplies given the strong oil demand growth in developing Asia and the Middle East. The average annual price for WTI moderated due to the economic crisis in the second half of 2008 that impacted demand from all regions of the world. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub increased 32 percent during 2008 to an average price of $9.04 per million British thermal units (MMBTU), primarily due to increased demand from the industrial and electric power sector during the first half of 2008 and higher oil prices. These factors were moderated by higher domestic production and lower demand, which led to higher storage in the second half of 2008. The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 11 percent in 2008. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were lower overall in comparison with 2007. The primary factor contributing to the reduced refining margins in 2008 was a decrease in gasoline demand. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOIL’s results are subject to factors similar to those of our E&P and R&M segments. LUKOIL’s upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals) crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are significant factors on LUKOIL’s downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ (13,479 ) 4,615 9,848 Midstream 541 453 476 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 2,322 5,923 4,481 LUKOIL Investment (5,488 ) 1,818 1,425 Chemicals 110 359 492 Emerging Businesses 30 (8 ) 15 Corporate and Other (1,034 ) (1,269 ) (1,187 ) Net income (loss) $ (16,998 ) 11,891 15,550 2008 vs. 2007 The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of: • A $25,443 million before- and after-tax goodwill impairment of all E&P segment goodwill. This impairment was recorded during the fourth quarter. • A $7,410 million before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. • Lower U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment. • An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our E&P and R&M segments. These items were partially offset by: • Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, benefiting our E&P, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits were somewhat counteracted by increased production taxes. • A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before-tax, $4,512 million after-tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation on June 26, 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 The lower results in 2007 were primarily the result of: • The complete impairment of our oil interests in Venezuela. • Lower crude oil production in the E&P segment. • Higher production and operating expenses, higher production taxes, and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the E&P segment. These items were partially offset by: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts in the E&P and R&M segments. • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in the E&P segment. • Higher realized worldwide refining margins, including the benefit of planned inventory reductions, in the R&M segment. • Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. 38 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and other operating revenues increased 28 percent in 2008, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. These increases were mainly the result of higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting: • Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture. • Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. • The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in 2007. • Increased losses related to our Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture as a result of higher production taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs during the startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, DCP Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties. Other income decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. Exploration expenses increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs and higher expenses for post-discovery feasibility and development planning studies. Impairments increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This increase reflects a $25,443 million goodwill impairment recorded during 2008 in our E&P segment. Also contributing to the increase was a $7,410 million impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during 2008. These 2008 impairments were partially offset by a 2007 impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. Other impairments increased $1,244 million during 2008 primarily due to property impairments taken in response to a significantly diminished outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices, refining margins and power spreads, as well as in response to revised capital spending plans. For additional information, see Note 7—Investments, Loans, and Long-Term Receivables, Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, and Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Foreign currency transaction losses incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents 2007 vs. 2006 Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2007. The increase reflects earnings from WRB and FCCL, our downstream and upstream business ventures with EnCana, formed in January 2007. Also, we had improved results from LUKOIL, reflecting higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from Hamaca and Petrozuata, our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, CPChem reported lower earnings, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Other income increased 188 percent during 2007, primarily due to: • Higher net gains on asset dispositions associated with asset rationalization efforts. • The release in 2007 of escrowed funds related to the extinguishment of Hamaca project financing. • The Alaska Quality Bank settlements in 2007. These increases were partially offset by the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. Exploration expenses increased 21 percent during 2007, primarily reflecting the amortization of unproved North American leaseholds obtained in the Burlington Resources acquisition and the impairment of an international exploration license. The increase also reflects higher geological and geophysical expenses and higher dry hole costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 14 percent during 2007, primarily resulting from the addition of Burlington Resources’ assets in the E&P segment’s depreciable asset base for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006. Impairments reflects an impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela recorded in the second quarter of 2007. Impairments unrelated to the expropriation decreased 35 percent during 2007, primarily due to impairments recorded in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the R&M segment, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. Interest and debt expense increased 15 percent during 2007, primarily due to the interest expense component of the Alaska Quality Bank settlements, as well as higher expense associated with the funding requirements for the business venture with EnCana. Foreign currency transaction gains during 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. 40 Table of Contents Segment Results E&P 2008 2007 2006 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Alaska $ 2,315 2,255 2,347 Lower 48 2,673 1,993 2,001 United States 4,988 4,248 4,348 International 6,976 367 5,500 Goodwill impairment (25,443 ) — — $ (13,479 ) 4,615 9,848 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 97.47 68.00 61.09 International 93.30 70.79 63.38 Total consolidated 95.15 69.47 62.39 Equity affiliates* 63.89 45.31 46.01 Worldwide E&P 93.12 67.11 60.37 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 7.67 5.98 6.11 International 8.76 6.51 6.27 Total consolidated 8.28 6.26 6.20 Equity affiliates* 2.04 .30 .30 Worldwide E&P 8.27 6.26 6.19 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 55.63 46.00 40.35 International 59.70 48.80 42.89 Total consolidated 57.43 47.13 41.50 Worldwide E&P 57.43 47.13 41.50 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent** United States $ 8.34 6.52 5.43 International 8.08 7.68 5.65 Total consolidated 8.20 7.13 5.55 Equity affiliates* 13.51 8.92 5.83 Worldwide E&P 8.37 7.21 5.57 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. ** For information on taxes other than income taxes per barrel of oil equivalent, see the “Statistics” section of the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosure.

It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2008, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ecuador, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia. 2008 vs. 2007 The E&P segment recorded a net loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount includes a $25,443 million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E&P segment goodwill. In 2007, the E&P segment had net income of $4,615 million, which includes the impact of a $4,588 million before-tax impairment ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, and the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. The decrease in net income was attributed to the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than income (mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs, increased impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our E&P segment recognized property impairment charges totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada. E&P’s results for 2008 reflect an average realized worldwide selling price of $93.12 per barrel of crude oil. In contrast, our average realized worldwide crude oil price per barrel in December 2008 was $37.23. If average crude oil prices in 2009 do not increase appreciably from the low levels at year-end 2008, we would expect E&P’s 2009 results to be negatively impacted. Proved reserves at year-end 2008 were 8.08 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 8.72 billion at year-end 2007. This excludes the estimated 1,893 million BOE and 1,838 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2008 and 2007, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude, which was 249 million barrels at year-end 2008, compared with 221 million at year-end 2007. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48, and higher operating costs. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from 843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 reflecting the impact of hurricane disruptions. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976 million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the Venezuelan impairment on our prior-year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. International E&P production averaged 992,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from 1,014,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new developments 43 Table of Contents in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 22,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 23,000 barrels per day in 2007. In regards to our Venezuelan assets expropriated during 2007, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was registered by ICSID on December 13, 2007. The tribunal of three arbitrators is constituted, and the arbitration proceeding is under way. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. In April 2008, we initiated arbitration with ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador as a result of the government’s confiscatory fiscal measures enacted in 2006 and 2007, as well as the government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts into service agreements with inferior fiscal and legal terms. The arbitration has been registered by ICSID, the arbitration tribunal is fully constituted and the case is proceeding. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009. A component of the new royalty rate calculation for each well will be based on prevailing prices, and therefore we expect that our reported production and reserve volumes will move inversely with changes in commodity prices. This change will impact both our conventional western Canada natural gas and oil business and our oil sands operations. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the E&P segment decreased 53 percent in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a noncash impairment of $4,588 million before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. The decrease in net income during 2007 reflects this impairment, as well as lower crude oil production, higher production taxes and operating costs, and higher DD&A expense. These decreases were partially offset by: • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. • A net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. • A benefit related to the release of escrowed funds in connection with the extinguishment of the Hamaca project financing. • The Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Proved reserves at year-end 2007 were 8.72 billion BOE, compared with 9.36 billion at year-end 2006. This excludes the estimated 1,838 million BOE and 1,805 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude, which was 221 million barrels at year-end 2007, compared with 243 million at year-end 2006. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations decreased 2 percent, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska, higher operating costs and DD&A expense, and lower crude oil production. These decreases were mostly offset by: • Higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids production. • The Alaska Quality Bank settlements. • Gains on the sale of assets in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2007, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, with retroactive provisions, which results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. 44 Table of Contents U.S. E&P production averaged 843,000 BOE per day in 2007, an increase of 4 percent from 808,000 in 2006. Production was impacted by the inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007, offset slightly by field decline. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations decreased 93 percent, primarily due to the impairment of expropriated assets in Venezuela, lower crude oil production, higher DD&A expense, and higher operating costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, a net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and the benefit from the release of the escrowed funds related to the Hamaca project. International E&P production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2007, a decrease of 10 percent from 1,128,000 in 2006. Production was impacted by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil projects, planned and unplanned downtime in Australia and the North Sea, production sharing contract impacts in Australia, our exit from Dubai, and the effect of asset dispositions. These decreases were slightly offset by new production volumes from our FCCL upstream business venture with EnCana, as well as inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 23,000 barrels per day in 2007, compared with 21,000 in 2006. During 2006, significant tax legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The United Kingdom increased income tax rates on upstream income, resulting in a negative earnings impact of $470 million to adjust 2006 taxes and restate deferred tax liabilities. In Canada, an overall rate reduction in 2006 resulted in a favorable earnings impact of $401 million to restate deferred tax liabilities.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 45 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 5 percent in 2007, reflecting a shift in natural gas purchase contract terms that are more favorable to natural gas producers. In addition, earnings from DCP Midstream were lower, primarily due to increased operating costs, mainly repairs, maintenance and asset integrity work. The results also reflect a positive tax adjustment included in the 2006 results. These decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. 46 Table of Contents R&M 2008 2007 2006 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 1,540 4,615 3,915 International 782 1,308 566 $ 2,322 5,923 4,481 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Gasoline Wholesale $ 2.65 2.27 2.04 Retail 2.81 2.42 2.18 Distillates—wholesale 3.06 2.29 2.11 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year-end 2007 and 2006 was 2,037,000 and 2,208,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our domestic refineries, and 669,000 and 693,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our international refineries. The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 47 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the R&M segment decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to decreases in U.S. refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating costs, a reduced benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and refining volumes due to asset sales. During 2008, our R&M segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. These R&M decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. We expect our 2009 rate to be similar to our rate in 2008. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of lower refining margins and, to a lesser extent, lower refining volumes and higher turnaround and utility costs. In addition, property impairments increased in 2008, including an impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in 2007. The decline in the current-year rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and unplanned downtime including impacts from hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the decrease were higher property impairments, including impacts from a 2008 impairment of a refinery in Europe and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to an increase in the fair value of previously impaired assets held for sale. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a reduced net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, negative foreign currency exchange impacts, the absence of a $141 million 2007 German tax legislation benefit, and lower refining and marketing volumes due to asset sales. Higher international refining and marketing margins partially offset these decreases. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90 percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude throughput at our Wilhelmshaven refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the R&M segment increased 32 percent in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. • Higher realized worldwide refining margins, reflecting in part the impact of planned inventory reductions, including a benefit of $260 million from the liquidation of prior-year layers under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. • Higher U.S. Gulf and East Coast refining volumes due to lower planned maintenance and less weather-related downtime. • A 2007 deferred tax benefit related to tax legislation in Germany. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of assets to WRB Refining LLC, foreign currency impacts, and lower marketing sales volumes due to asset sales. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2007, primarily due to: • Higher refining volumes at our Gulf and East Coast refineries. • Higher realized refining and marketing margins, due in part to the benefit of planned inventory reductions. 48 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of the Wood River and Borger refineries to WRB, and the impact of business interruption insurance recoveries on our 2006 results. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2007, compared with 92 percent in 2006, primarily reflecting lower planned maintenance and less weather-related downtime. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations increased 131 percent in 2007, due primarily to: • The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. • The deferred tax benefit related to the tax legislation in Germany. • Higher realized refining margins. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts and lower marketing volumes due to the asset sales. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2007, compared with 91 percent in 2006. The 2007 utilization rate was affected by a temporary idling of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany during the month of August due to economic conditions. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income (Loss) $ (5,488 ) 1,818 1,425 Operating Statistics* Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 386 401 360 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 356 256 244 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 229 214 179 * Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.06 percent at that date. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future-period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 49 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million net loss during 2008, compared with $1,818 million of net income in 2007. The 2008 results include a $7,410 million noncash, before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact of the impairment, income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 6 percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized prices of both refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff rates, as well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2007, recorded in 2008, decreased net income $16 million, compared with a $19 million decrease to net income recorded in 2007 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 28 percent during 2007, primarily due to higher estimated realized prices, higher estimated volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership. The increase was partially offset by higher estimated taxes and operating costs, as well as the net impact from the alignment of estimated net income to reported results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006, recorded in 2007, decreased net income $19 million, compared with a $71 million increase to net income recorded in 2006 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income $ 110 359 492 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 69 percent in 2008 due to higher utilities and other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one-time tax benefits, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. Increases in olefins and polyolefins margins somewhat offset these negative effects. Business conditions in the chemicals and plastics industry are expected to remain challenging in the near term. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 27 percent during 2007, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins and higher turnaround and weather-related repair costs, offset partially by a capital-loss tax benefit of $65 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. 50 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 106 53 82 Other (76 ) (61 ) (67 ) $ 30 (8 ) 15 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2008 vs. 2007 Emerging Businesses reported net income of $30 million in 2008, compared with a net loss of $8 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results, including the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85 million after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power results. 2007 vs. 2006 The Emerging Businesses segment had a net loss of $8 million in 2007, compared with net income of $15 million in 2006. The decrease reflects lower margins from the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as higher spending associated with alternative energy programs. These decreases were slightly offset by the inclusion of a write-down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant in 2006 results. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Loss Net interest $ (558 ) (820 ) (870 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (202 ) (176 ) (133 ) Acquisition/merger-related costs — (44 ) (98 ) Other (274 ) (229 ) (86 ) $ (1,034 ) (1,269 ) (1,187 ) 2008 vs. 2007 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. In 2008, net interest decreased 32 percent primarily due to lower average interest rates and a higher effective tax rate. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2008, mainly as a result of increased charitable contributions. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. “Other” expenses increased in 2008 due to various tax-related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. 51 Table of Contents 2007 vs. 2006 Net interest decreased 6 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher amounts of interest being capitalized, partially offset by a premium on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 32 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher benefit-related expenses. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. Results from “Other” were primarily impacted by foreign currency losses in 2007.

In addition, during 2008 we raised $1,640 million in proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2008, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repurchase shares of our common stock, provide loan financing to certain equity affiliates, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements to FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. Total dividends paid on our common stock during the year were $2,854 million. During 2008, cash and cash equivalents decreased $701 million to $755 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper markets in the United States, have recently experienced adverse conditions. Although we have not been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our ability, or the ability of third parties with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2008, cash of $22,658 million was provided by operating activities, an 8 percent decrease from cash from operations of $24,550 million in 2007. Contributing to the decrease were lower U.S. refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our R&M segment in 2008, versus reductions in 2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices in our E&P segment. 52 Table of Contents During 2007, cash flow from operations increased $3,034 million to $24,550 million. Contributing to the improvement over 2006 results was a planned inventory reduction in the 2007 period, partially related to the formation of the WRB downstream business venture; the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition late in the first quarter of 2006; and higher worldwide crude oil prices in 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by the absence of dividends from our Venezuelan operations in 2007. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our production for 2008, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.21 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the price effect of production sharing contracts; changes in fiscal terms of projects; project delays; and weather-related disruptions. Although actual year-to-year production levels will vary, based on our current outlook and planning assumptions, we project no material change in annual production levels from 2008 through 2013. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2008, including equity affiliates, was 31 percent. The 2008 reserve replacement was adversely impacted by low year-end commodity prices, which resulted in significant negative reserve revisions. Our 2008 reserve replacement from consolidated operations and from our equity affiliates was a negative 23 percent and a positive 224 percent, respectively. Over the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent. This was comprised of a reserve replacement from consolidated operations of 115 percent and from equity affiliates of 153 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant factor in replacing our reserves over the past three-year period, partially offset by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Significant purchases during this three-year period included reserves added as part of the 2008 Origin Energy joint venture, the 2007 EnCana business venture, and the 2006 acquisition of Burlington Resources, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL in 2006. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures in the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2008 and 2006, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2007 revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how 53 Table of Contents revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the “Capital Spending” section for an analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. In 2006, we received approximately $1.1 billion in distributions from two heavy-oil projects in Venezuela. The majority of these distributions represented operating results from previous years. We did not receive an operating distribution related to these projects in 2007 or 2008. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2008 were $1,640 million, compared with $3,572 million in 2007. The amounts for both periods are mainly due to asset rationalization efforts related to the program we announced in April 2006 to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. We do not expect any material asset dispositions in 2009 beyond the sale of our U.S. retail marketing assets. In January 2009, we closed on the sale of a large part of these assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million five-year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2008, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $9.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility, expiring in September 2012, and a $2.5 billion facility scheduled to expire in September 2009 (terminated in early 2009, see the “Shelf Registrations” section below). The $7.35 billion facility was reduced from $7.5 billion during the third quarter of 2008 due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., one of the revolver participants. The $2.5 billion facility is a 364-day bank facility entered into during October 2008 to provide additional support of a temporary expansion of our commercial paper program. We expanded our commercial paper program to ensure adequate liquidity after the initial funding of our transaction with Origin Energy. For additional information on the Origin transaction, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, as support for our commercial paper programs, or as support of up to $250 million on commercial paper issued by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline LP, a Keystone pipeline joint venture entity. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $8.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million and $41 million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under both commercial paper programs, there was $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008, compared with $725 million at December 31, 2007. Since we had $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding, had issued $40 million of letters of credit and had up to a $250 million guarantee on commercial paper issued by Keystone, we had access to $2.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008. Shelf Registrations We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under this shelf registration, in May 2008 we issued notes consisting of $400 million of 4.40% Notes due 2013, $500 million of 5.20% Notes due 2018 and 54 Table of Contents $600 million of 5.90% Notes due 2038. The proceeds from the offering were used at that time to reduce commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Also under this shelf registration, in early 2009 we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds of the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. Under the terms of the $2.5 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility noted above, the receipt of the proceeds from this bond offering terminated this revolving credit facility. Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investor Service and “A” by both Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch, unchanged from December 31, 2008. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. In the event our credit rating deteriorates to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility. We also have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. Minority Interests At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding $1,100 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $507 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $580 million, was related to Darwin LNG, an operation located in Australia’s Northern Territory. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return consisting of 1.32 percent plus a three-month LIBOR rate set at the beginning of each quarter. The preferred return at December 31, 2008, was 5.37 percent. In 2008, Cold Spring declined its option to remarket its investment in Ashford. This option remains available in 2018 and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter. If remarketing is unsuccessful, we could be required to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event such a letter of credit is not provided, cause the redemption of Cold Spring’s investment in Ashford. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2008, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2008, Ashford held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable, and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2008, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: • Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly 55 Table of Contents owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2008, Qatargas 3 had $3.0 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $835 million, and an additional $76 million of accrued interest. • Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2.0 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Rockies Express is constructing a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2008, Rockies Express had $1,561 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $375 million. In addition, we have a 24 percent guarantee on $600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt nonrecourse. • Keystone Oil Pipeline: In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), to create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. Keystone is constructing a crude oil pipeline originating in Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma. In connection with certain planning and construction activities, we agreed to reimburse TransCanada with respect to a portion of guarantees issued by TransCanada for certain of Keystone’s obligations to third parties. Our maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees is based on our ultimate ownership percentage in Keystone and is estimated to be $180 million, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Payments under the guarantees are contingent upon the partners not making necessary equity contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is considered unlikely payments would be required. All but $8 million of the guarantees will terminate after construction is completed, currently estimated to occur in 2010. In October 2008, we elected to exercise an option to reduce our equity interest in Keystone from 50 percent to 20.01 percent. The change in equity will occur through a dilution mechanism, which is expected to gradually lower our ownership interest until it reaches 20.01 percent by the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 38.7 percent. In addition to the above guarantees, in order to obtain long-term shipping commitments that would enable a pipeline expansion starting at Hardisty, Alberta, and extending to near Port Arthur, Texas, the Keystone owners executed an agreement in July 2008 to guarantee Keystone’s obligations under its agreement to provide transportation at a specified price for certain shippers to the Gulf Coast. Although our guarantee is for 50 percent of these obligations, TransCanada has agreed to reimburse us for amounts we pay in excess of our ownership percentage in Keystone. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under this guarantee, after such reimbursement, is estimated to be $220 million ($550 million before reimbursement) based on a full 20-year term of the shipping commitments, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, are contingent upon Keystone defaulting on its obligation to construct the pipeline in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 56 Table of Contents In December 2008, we provided a guarantee of up to $250 million of balances outstanding under a commercial paper program. This program was established by Keystone to provide funding for a portion of Keystone’s construction costs attributable to our ownership interest in the project. Payment under the guarantee would be due in the event Keystone failed to repay principal and interest, when due, to short-term noteholders. The commercial paper program and our guarantee are expected to increase as funding needs increase during construction of the Keystone pipeline. Keystone’s other owner will guarantee a similar, but separate, funding vehicle. Post-construction Keystone financing is anticipated to be nonrecourse to us. At December 31, 2008, $200 million was outstanding under the Keystone commercial paper program guaranteed by us. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2008, was $27.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion during 2008, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 33 percent at year-end 2008, versus 19 percent at the end of 2007. The increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was mainly due to noncash impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the increase in debt. Our debt-to-capital target range is 20 percent to 25 percent. In January 2008, we reduced our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011 from $3 billion to $2 billion, with a subsequent reduction in June 2008 to $1.5 billion. In March 2008, we redeemed our $300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at a premium of $8 million, plus accrued interest. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $625 million is short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2008, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $593 million in 2008, was included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payments was reflected as an additional capital contribution and was included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the end of 2008. This amount included $2 billion remaining under a previously announced program. At year-end 2007, approximately $10.1 billion remained authorized for share repurchases in 2008. During 2008, we repurchased 103.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.2 billion. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing. Through December 31, 2008, we had provided $835 million in loan financing, and an additional $76 million of accrued interest. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to participate in an LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas, for which construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport to provide loan financing for the construction of the facility. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and in August 2008, the loan was converted from a construction loan to a term loan and consisted of $650 million in loan financing and $124 million of accrued interest. Freeport began making repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding at December 31, 2008, was $757 million. 57 Table of Contents In 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. Terminal construction was completed in June 2008, and the final loan amount was $275 million at December 2008 exchange rates, excluding accrued interest. Although repayments are not required to start until May 2010, Varandey used available cash to repay $12 million of interest in the second half of 2008. The outstanding accrued interest at December 31, 2008, was $38 million at December exchange rates. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the “Loans and advances—related parties” line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in “Accounts and notes receivable—related parties.” In February 2009, we announced a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 2, 2009, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 23, 2009. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2008: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2-3 4-5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 27,427 353 6,205 9,511 11,358 Capital lease obligations 28 17 5 — 6 Total debt 27,455 370 6,210 9,511 11,364 Interest on debt and other obligations 14,846 1,381 2,403 1,640 9,422 Operating lease obligations 3,769 868 1,257 727 917 Purchase obligations (b) 76,862 30,575 8,415 5,726 32,146 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 6,294 625 1,354 1,505 2,810 Other long-term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 6,615 258 543 604 5,210 Accrued environmental costs 979 173 288 146 372 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 100 100 (e) (e) (e) Total $ 136,920 34,350 20,470 19,859 62,241 (a) Includes $639 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL), natural gas, and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $35,732 million; $28,315 million of these commitments are product purchases from the following affiliated companies: CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining term of 91 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 16 years. 58 Table of Contents Purchase obligations of $8,185 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over an eight-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture formed with EnCana. (d) Does not include: Pensions—for the 2009 through 2013 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $625 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $161 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $925 million for 2009 and then approximately $550 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2009 is expected to be $274 million in the United States and $98 million outside the United States. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $968 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2009 Budget 2008 2007 2006 E&P United States—Alaska $ 832 1,414 666 820 United States—Lower 48 2,668 3,836 3,122 2,008 International 5,959 11,206 6,147 6,685 9,459 16,456 9,935 9,513 Midstream 7 4 5 4 R&M United States 1,409 1,643 1,146 1,597 International 577 626 240 1,419 1,986 2,269 1,386 3,016 LUKOIL Investment — — — 2,715 Chemicals — — — — Emerging Businesses 100 156 257 83 Corporate and Other 150 214 208 265 $ 11,702 19,099 11,791 15,596 United States $ 5,076 7,111 5,225 4,735 International 6,626 11,988 6,566 10,861 $ 11,702 19,099 11,791 15,596 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, totaled $46.5 billion, with 77 percent going to our E&P segment. Included in these amounts was approximately $4.7 billion related to the October 2008 closing of a transaction with Origin Energy to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business through a 50/50 joint venture named Australia Pacific LNG. The joint venture will focus on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. For additional information about the Origin transaction, 59 Table of Contents see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2009 is $11.7 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $600 million in capitalized interest. The decline from 2008 spending is primarily due to the closing of the transaction with Origin Energy in 2008 and the deferring or slowing of some projects or programs in 2009, as a result of the current business environment. We plan to direct 81 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 17 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2009 is approximately $12.5 billion. E&P Capital expenditures and investments for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, totaled $35.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: • Significant U.S. lease acquisitions in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea offshore Alaska, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including West Sak; the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area; the Alpine field, including satellite field prospects; and the Cook Inlet Area; as well as initiatives to progress the gas pipeline project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline; and exploration activities. • Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. • Investment in West2East Pipeline LLC, a company holding a 100 percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. • Development of the Surmont heavy-oil project, capital expenditures related to the FCCL upstream business venture, and development of conventional oil and gas reserves, all in Canada. • Development drilling and facilities projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area and the Alvheim project, both located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. • The Statfjord Late Life project straddling the offshore boundary between Norway and the United Kingdom. • The Britannia satellite developments in the U.K. North Sea. • An integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. • Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and continued development of these concessions. • Ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields in Nigeria and ongoing exploration activities both onshore and within deepwater leases. • The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. • Development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL. • The initial investment related to the 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy. • Projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and adjacent field prospects. • The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. 2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&P’s 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget is $9.5 billion, 43 percent lower than actual expenditures in 2008. The decline is primarily due to the 2008 Origin transaction and the deferring or slowing of some projects or programs. Thirty-seven percent of E&P’s 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. 60 Table of Contents Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to fund Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations, including the Alpine satellite fields, as well as initiatives to progress Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline, and exploration activities. In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development programs in the Permian, San Juan, Williston and Fort Worth basins and the Lobo Trend in South Texas, as well as for development of projects such as the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline. E&P is directing $6.0 billion of its 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2009 will be directed to developing major long-term projects including: • Oil sands projects, primarily those associated with the FCCL business venture, and ongoing natural gas projects in Canada. • In the North Sea, the Ekofisk Area, J-Block fields, Greater Britannia fields and various southern North Sea assets. • The Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea. • Advancement of coalbed methane projects in Australia associated with the Origin Energy joint venture. • Continued development of Bohai Bay in China. • The Gumusut field offshore Malaysia. • The North Belut field in Block B, as well as other projects offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. • Fields offshore Vietnam. • Continued development of the Qatargas 3 project in Qatar. • The Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi. • Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 156 percent, 77 percent and 37 percent of our total net additions in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 15 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,823 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2008, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three-year period ending 2011 will be approximately 15 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2009 through 2011 are projected to be $3.9 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2008 were associated with 10 major development areas in our E&P segment, and our investment in LUKOIL. Eight of the major development areas within E&P are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: • The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. • The Peng Lai 19-3 field in China. • Fields in the United States. • FCCL heavy-oil projects—Christina Lake and Foster Creek in Canada. • The Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada. The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. 61 Table of Contents R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $6.7 billion, representing 14 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three-year period included: • Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. • Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale refinery. • Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable production of low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur fuels. • Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), a joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. • Installation of a 25,000-barrel-per-day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger refinery. Commissioning of these units was completed following the formation of the WRB joint venture. • Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber refinery. Major construction activities in progress include: • Expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. • Construction of a low-sulfur gasoline project at the Billings refinery. • Construction of a new sulfur recovery unit at the Sweeny refinery. • Continued investment in the Keystone Oil Pipeline. • Construction of a wet gas scrubber at our Alliance refinery. 2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&M’s 2009 capital budget is $2.0 billion, a 12 percent decrease from actual spending in 2008. Domestic spending in 2009 is expected to comprise 71 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $1.1 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, reliability and capital maintenance. Work continues on projects to expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield, including funding for the San Francisco hydrocracker project. Our U.S. transportation, marketing and specialty businesses are expected to spend about $300 million, including investments in the Keystone project. Internationally, we plan to spend about $600 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as an upgrade project at the Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery. The construction bidding process for the refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, is currently scheduled to take place in 2009. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, was for purchases of ordinary shares of LUKOIL in 2006 to increase our ownership interest. No additional purchases were made in 2007 or 2008, and none are expected in 2009. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP. 62 Table of Contents Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for non-income-tax-related contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. 63 Table of Contents The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007, which was signed in late December. The new law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to meet these requirements. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate increasing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2007, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 68 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2008, we re-opened three sites and closed one of those sites, resolved and closed seven sites, and received two new notices of potential liability, leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and 64 Table of Contents amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $957 million in 2008 and are expected to be about $1.0 billion per year in 2009 and 2010. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,025 million in 2008 and are expected to be about $900 million per year in 2009 and 2010. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2008. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2008, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $979 million, compared with $1,089 million at December 31, 2007. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations that create a GHG emissions trading scheme or GHG reduction policies generally could significantly increase costs or reduce demand for fossil energy derived products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that does or could affect our operations include: • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. • California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. 65 Table of Contents • Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007) confirming that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. In light of this consensus, we have taken a position to encourage the adoption of a pragmatic and sustainable regulatory framework addressing GHG. To that end, we joined the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) in support of the development of a national regulatory framework to reduce the level of GHG emissions. We support a framework that is economically sustainable, environmentally effective, transparent and fair, and internationally linked. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement will apply to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other businesses. In general, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the disclosure requirements. Additionally, it changes the accounting treatment for transaction costs, acquired contingent arrangements, in-process research and development, restructuring costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of business combination, and changes in income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However, starting January 1, 2009, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting goodwill. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,” which requires noncontrolling interests, also called minority interests, to be presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income statement. Additionally, this Statement clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, it requires gain or loss recognition in net income based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date. This Statement is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively 66 Table of Contents with the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB No. 133.” This Statement expands disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” for derivative instruments within the scope of that Statement to provide greater transparency. This includes disclosure of the additional information regarding how and why derivative instruments are used, how derivatives are accounted for, and how they affect an entity’s financial performance. This Statement is effective for interim and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2009, but it will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than the additional disclosures. In November 2008, the FASB reached a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 08-6, “Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations” (EITF 08-6), which was issued to clarify how the application of equity method accounting will be affected by SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. EITF 08-6 clarifies that an entity shall continue to use the cost accumulation model for its equity method investments. It also confirms past accounting practices related to the treatment of contingent consideration and the use of the impairment model under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Additionally, it requires an equity method investor to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of the investment. This issue is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” to improve the transparency associated with the disclosures about the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP requires the disclosure of each major asset category at fair value using the fair value hierarchy in SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” Also, this FSP requires entities to disclose the net periodic benefit cost recognized for each annual period for which a statement of income is presented. This FSP is effective for annual statements beginning with 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management 67 Table of Contents exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2008, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,447 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $494 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 65 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately 2.4 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2009 would increase by approximately $30 million. The remaining $4,745 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2008 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.4 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. None of these major assets are expected to move to proved properties in 2009. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year-end 2008, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $589 million at year-end 2007. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 68 Table of Contents Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates, with assistance from third-party petroleum engineering consultants with regard to our equity interests in LUKOIL and Australia Pacific LNG. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved reserves also is important to the statement of operations because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2008, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $58 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2008 was approximately $7.7 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves of these fields were 6.1 billion BOE at the beginning of 2008 and were 5.5 billion BOE at the end of 2008. The estimated proved reserves of Canadian Syncrude assets were 221 million barrels at the beginning of 2008 and were 249 million barrels at the end of 2008. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2008 would have increased by an estimated $406 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $793 million, $471 million and $215 million, respectively. Of these write-downs, $56 million in 2008, $76 million in 2007 and $131 million in 2006 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that 69 Table of Contents are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks of the investment. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. 70 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2008, we had $738 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide E&P reporting unit. See the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to this impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. After the goodwill impairment, at December 31, 2008, we had $3,778 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $79 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $43 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 71 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: • Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. • Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. • Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. • Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. • International monetary conditions and exchange controls. • Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. • Liability resulting from litigation. • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including: armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation, or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. • Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. • Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 72 Table of Contents • The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. • The factors generally described in the “Risk Factors” section included in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Operating Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: • Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. • Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. • Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. 73 Table of Contents The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2008 or 2007, exchange rates.

These production curtailments contributed to lower production in 2020 compared with 2019 from our three focus areas: ● Eagle Ford—We operated five rigs on average in the Eagle Ford during 2020, resulting in 154 operated wells drilled and 71 operated wells brought online. Production decreased 14 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, averaging 186 MBOED and 216 MBOED, respectively. ● Bakken—We operated an average of two rigs during the year in the Bakken and participated in additional development activities operated by co-venturers. We continued our pad drilling with 57 operated wells drilled during the year and 29 operated wells brought online. Production decreased 20 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, averaging 78 MBOED and 97 MBOED, respectively. ● Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is a combination of legacy conventional and unconventional assets. We operated one rig during the full year and another rig during parts of the year in the Permian Basin, resulting in 16 operated wells drilled and 16 operated wells brought online. Production decreased 1 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, averaging 85 MBOED and 86 MBOED, respectively. Gulf of Mexico At year-end 2020, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico totaled approximately 60,000 net acres. A majority of the production consists of three fields operated by co-venturers: ● 15.9 percent interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area. ● 15.9 percent interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field. ● 12.4 percent interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area. Dispositions In the first quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of our Waddell Ranch interests in the Permian Basin and our Niobrara interests. Production from these dispositions was immaterial to the Lower 48 segment in 2020. For additional information on these transactions, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Facilities ● Lost Cabin Gas Plant—We operate and own a 60 percent interest in the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, a 246 MMCFD capacity natural gas processing facility in Lysite, Wyoming. The plant is currently operating at less than capacity due to a fire in December 2018. Restoration efforts are ongoing and anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2021. The expected production loss in 2021 is immaterial to the segment. ● Helena Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Helena Condensate Processing Facility, a 110 MBD condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas. ● Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own an 87.5 percent interest in the Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility, a 30 MBD condensate processing plant located near Pawnee, Texas. ● Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility, a 15 MBD condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas. This facility is currently being decommissioned. 9 CANADA Our Canadian operations consist of the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta and the liquids-rich Montney unconventional play in British Columbia. In 2020, operations in Canada contributed 9 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 3 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 Crude Oil NGL Natural Gas Bitumen Total Interest Operator MBD MBD MMCFD MBD MBOED Average Daily Net Production Surmont 50.0 % ConocoPhillips - - - 55 55 Montney 100.0 ConocoPhillips 6 2 40 - 15 Total Canada 6 2 40 55 70 Surmont Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called SAGD, whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing. We hold approximately 600,000 net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. that offers long-lived, sustained production. We are focused on structurally lowering costs, reducing GHG intensity and optimizing asset performance. In response to the oil price collapse that began in early 2020, we voluntarily curtailed production at Surmont by approximately 12 MBOED in 2020. For more information related to the 2020 industry downturn and our response, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Montney In August 2020, we completed the acquisition of additional Montney acreage from Kelt Exploration. This acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped properties, including 140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed asset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent to our existing Montney position. We now hold approximately 300,000 net acres in the Montney play with a 100 percent working interest. For additional information related to the Kelt Exploration acquisition, please see Note 4—Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Following the completion of third-party offtake facilities, our newly commissioned processing facility and production from our 2019 drilling program came online in February 2020. In 2020, development activity consisted of drilling 14 horizontal wells and completing 18 wells. Overall, 23 wells came online in 2020. In 2021, appraisal drilling and completions activity will continue to further explore the area’s resource potential. Exploration Our primary exploration focus is assessing our Montney acreage. Additionally, we have exploration acreage in the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. 10 EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea; the Norwegian Sea; Qatar; Libya; and commercial and terminalling operations in the U.K. In 2020, operations in Europe, Middle East and North Africa contributed 13 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 20 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.

The Tor II redevelopment achieved first production in December 2020. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. The Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields consist of several production platforms and facilities, with development drilling continuing over the coming years. The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, some gas is transported for use as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest, and the remainder is transported to Europe via gas processing terminals in Norway. Aasta Hansteen is a gas and condensate field located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced condensate is loaded onto shuttle tankers and transported to market. Gas is transported through the Polarled gas pipeline to the onshore Nyhamna processing plant for final processing prior to export to market. The Troll Field lies in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of the Troll A, B and C platforms. The natural gas from Troll A is transported to Kollsnes, Norway. Crude oil from floating platforms Troll B and Troll C is transported to Mongstad, Norway, for storage and export. The Alvheim Field is located in the northern part of the North Sea near the border with the U.K. sector, and consists of a FPSO vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) Terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE Pipeline. Visund is an oil and gas field located in the North Sea and consists of a floating drilling, production and processing unit, and subsea installations. Crude oil is transported by pipeline to a nearby third-party field for storage and export via tankers. The natural gas is transported to a gas processing plant at Kollsnes, Norway, through the Gassled transportation system. We also have varying ownership interests in two other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea. 11 Exploration A well we participated in during 2019, Canela, was expensed as a dry hole in 2020 after post drill analysis. In 2020, we completed the third well of a three-well operated exploration campaign in Block 25/7 in the North Sea with the Hasselbaink Well. The Hasselbaink Well encountered insufficient hydrocarbons and was expensed as a dry hole in 2020. In the second half of 2020 we completed a two-well operated exploration campaign in the Norwegian Sea with the Warka and Slagugle wells. Both the Warka and Slagugle wells encountered hydrocarbons and will be evaluated for future appraisal programs. We were awarded three new exploration licenses; PL1045, PL1047 and PL1064; and two acreage additions, PL917B and PL1009B. Additionally, we exchanged our interest in the PL938 exploration license for increased interest in the PL1047 exploration license. Transportation We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization and NGLs processing facility in Teesside, England. Facilities We operate and have a 40.25 percent ownership interest in an oil terminal at Teesside, England to support our Norway operations.

In 2020, we had five crude liftings from Es Sider, compared with 19 crude liftings from Es Sider in 2019. Production ceased in February 2020, due to a forced shutdown of the Es Sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals after a period of civil unrest. In October 2020, force majeure was lifted allowing production operations and related oil exports to resume. ASIA PACIFIC The Asia Pacific segment has exploration and production operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. In 2020, operations in the Asia Pacific segment contributed 10 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 32 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.

Australia Pacific LNG Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, to supply the domestic gas market and convert the CBM into LNG for export. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business. We operate two fully subscribed 4.5-million-metric-tonnes-per-year LNG trains. Approximately 2,800 net wells are ultimately expected to supply both the LNG sales contracts and domestic gas market. The wells are supported by gathering systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and an export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. The LNG is being sold to Sinopec under 20-year sales agreements for 7.6 million metric tonnes of LNG per year, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. under a 20-year sales agreement for approximately 1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year. As of December 31, 2020, APLNG has an outstanding balance of $6.2 billion on a $8.5 billion project finance facility. Project finance interest payments are bi-annual, concluding September 2030. 13 For additional information, see Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 11—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Exploration In 2019, we entered into an agreement with 3D Oil to acquire a 75 percent interest in and operatorship of an offshore Exploration Permit (T/49P) located in the Otway Basin, Australia. We obtained an additional five percent interest in 2020, increasing our interest to 80 percent. The required government approvals for the transfer of this interest were obtained in June 2020. We plan to conduct a 3-D seismic survey in the second half of 2021, subject to governmental approval of a recently submitted Environmental Plan. Dispositions In May 2020, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Australia-West assets and operations. These subsidiaries held a 37.5 percent interest in the Barossa Project and Caldita Field, a 56.9 percent interest in the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu-Undan Field, and a 40 percent interest in the Greater Poseidon Fields. Production from the beginning of the year through the disposition date in May 2020 averaged 43 MBOED.

Indonesia 2020 Crude Oil NGL Natural Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production South Sumatra 54 % ConocoPhillips 2 - 290 50 Total Indonesia 2 - 290 50 During 2020, we operated two PSCs in Indonesia: the Corridor Block located in South Sumatra, and Kualakurun in Central Kalimantan. Currently, we have production from the Corridor Block. South Sumatra The Corridor PSC consists of two oil fields and seven producing natural gas fields. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. In 2019, we were awarded a 20-year extension, with new terms, of the Corridor PSC. Under these terms, we retain a majority interest and continue as operator for at least three years after 2023 and retain a participating interest until 2043. Exploration We entered into the Central Kalimantan Kualakurun Block PSC in 2015 with an exploration period of six years. We completed the firm working commitment program in 2017, which included satellite mapping and a 740-kilometer 2-D seismic acquisition program. After completion of prospect evaluation, both PSC contractors decided to relinquish rights and return this block to the government. Transportation We are a 35 percent owner of a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore natural gas pipelines. 14 China 2020 Crude Oil NGL Natural Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production Penglai 49.0 % CNOOC 30 - - 30 Total China 30 - - 30 Penglai The Penglai 19-3, 19-9 and 25-6 fields are located in the Bohai Bay Block 11/05 and are in various stages of development. Phase 1 and 2 include production from all three Penglai oil fields. Wellhead Platform J Project in the Penglai 19-9 Field achieved first production in 2016. This project consisted of 62 wells that have all been completed and brought online as of December 2020. The Phase 3 Project in the Penglai 19-3 and 19-9 fields consists of three new wellhead platforms and a central processing platform. First production from Phase 3 was achieved in 2018 for two wellhead platforms and in 2020 for the third wellhead platform. This project could include up to 186 wells, 91 of which have been completed and brought online as of December 2020. The Phase 4A Project in the Penglai 25-6 Field consists of one new wellhead platform and achieved first production in December 2020. This project could include up to 62 new wells, two of which have been completed and brought online as of December 2020. Panyu We have a production license for Panyu 4-1 in Block 15/34. If a development occurs, our production license is for 15 years upon commencement of production. Exploration Exploration activities in the Bohai Penglai Field during 2020 consisted of two successful appraisal wells supporting future developments in the Bohai Bay Block 11/05. We fulfilled our exploration well commitment in Panyu 4-1 in early 2020. No further exploration well operations are planned. Malaysia 2020 Crude Oil NGL Natural Gas Total Interest Operator MBD MBD MMCFD MBOED Average Daily Net Production Gumusut 29.0 % Shell 21 - - 21 Malikai 35.0 Shell 11 - - 11 Kebabangan (KBB) 30.0 KPOC 1 - 52 10 Siakap North-Petai 21.0 PTTEP 2 - - 2 Total Malaysia 35 - 52 44 We have varying stages of exploration, development and production activities across 1.5 million net acres in Malaysia, with working interests in five PSCs. Three of these PSCs are located in waters off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G, Block J and the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). We operate two exploration blocks, Block WL4-00 and SK304 in waters off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak. 15 Block J Gumusut We currently have a 29 percent working interest in the Gumusut Field following the redetermination of the Block J and Block K Malaysia Unit in 2017. Gumusut Phase 2 first oil was achieved in 2019. Development drilling associated with Gumusut Phase 3 is planned to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the first of four planned wells. First oil is anticipated in 2022. KBBC The KBBC PSC grants us a 30 percent working interest in the KBB, Kamunsu East and Kamunsu East Upthrown Canyon gas and condensate fields. In 2020, we recognized dry hole expense and impaired the associated carrying value of unproved properties in the Kamunsu East Field that is no longer in our development plans. KBB During 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating LNG vessel which provided increased gas offtake capacity. Production from the field has been reduced since January 2020, due to the rupture of a third-party pipeline which carries gas production from KBB to market. The pipeline operator has initiated repairs with no production expected to flow through the full length of the pipeline during 2021. Block G Malikai We hold a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. This field achieved first production in December 2016 via the Malikai Tension Leg Platform, ramping to peak production in 2018. The KMU-1 exploration well was completed and started producing through the Malikai platform in 2018. Malikai Phase 2 development, a six-well drilling campaign, commenced in 2020, with first oil anticipated in 2021. Siakap North-Petai We hold a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil field. First oil from SNP Phase 2, a four-well program, is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2021. Production Curtailments We experienced production curtailments of 4 MBOED in 2020. Exploration In 2017, we were awarded operatorship and a 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00, which included the existing Salam-1 oil discovery and encompassed 0.6 million gross acres. In 2018 and 2019, two exploration and two appraisal wells were drilled, resulting in oil discoveries under evaluation at Salam and Benum, while two Patawali wells were expensed as dry holes in 2019. Further exploration drilling is planned for 2021. In 2018, we were awarded a 50 percent working interest and operatorship of Block SK304 encompassing 2.1 million gross acres offshore Sarawak. We acquired 3-D seismic over the acreage and completed processing of this data in 2019. Exploration drilling is planned for 2021. In June 2020, we relinquished our 50 percent interest in Block SK 313, a 1.4 million gross-acre exploration block offshore Sarawak. OTHER INTERNATIONAL The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia and Argentina and contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries. As a result of our completed Concho acquisition on January 15, 2021, we refocused our exploration program and announced our intent to pursue a managed exit from certain areas. 16 Colombia We have an 80 percent operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3. The block extends over approximately 67,000 net acres and contains the Picoplata-1 Well, which completed drilling in 2015 and testing in 2017. Plug and abandonment activity started during 2018 and completed in 2019. In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 Block which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. As part of a case brought forward by environmental groups, the Highest Administrative Court granted a preliminary injunction temporarily suspending hydraulic fracturing activities until the substance of the case is decided. As a result, we filed two separate Force Majeure requests before the relevant authority for both blocks, which were granted. We have no immediate plans to perform under existing contracts, therefore, the Picoplata-1 Well was recorded to dry hole expense and we fully impaired the capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs associated with our Colombia assets during 2020. Chile In September 2020, we notified the operator of our decision to exit our 49 percent interest in the Coiron Block, located in the Magallanes Basin in southern Chile. We are working with local authorities to finalize our withdrawal from this block. Argentina We have a 50 percent nonoperated interest in El Turbio Este Block, within the Austral Basin in southern Argentina. Following the acquisition and processing of 3-D seismic covering approximately 500 square miles in 2019, planned activities in 2020 were delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 and force majeure in the block. We have a 50 percent non-operated interest in the Bandurria Norte and Aguada Federal blocks within the Neuquen Basin in central Argentina. Following a successful production test of two horizontal wells on the Aguada Federal Block, we increased our interest from 45 to 50 percent in April 2020 where two horizontal wells continued production testing throughout the year. Preparation for a 2021 work program is ongoing. Venezuela and Ecuador For discussion of our contingencies in Venezuela and Ecuador, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER Marketing Activities Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, NGLs and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third-party volumes to better position the company to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity. Natural Gas Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our natural gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials; independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs. Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids Our crude oil, bitumen and NGL revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. 17 LNG LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity LNG production facilities located in Australia and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under long-term contracts with prices based on market indices. Energy Partnerships Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) We are a founding member of the MWCC, a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC’s containment system meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. OSRL Subsea Well Intervention Service (SWIS) OSRL-SWIS is a non-profit organization in the U.K. that is an industry funded joint initiative providing the capability to respond to subsea well-control incidents. Through our SWIS subscription, ConocoPhillips has access to equipment that is maintained and stored in a response ready state. This provides well capping and containment capability outside the U.S. Oil Spill Response Removal Organizations (OSROs) We maintain memberships in several OSROs across the globe as a key element of our preparedness program in addition to internal response resources. Many of the OSROs are not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively participate as a member of the board of directors, steering committee, work group or other supporting role. Globally, our primary OSRO is Oil Spill Response Ltd. based in the U.K., with facilities in several other countries and the ability to respond anywhere in the world. In North America, our primary OSROs include the Marine Spill Response Corporation for the continental U. S. and Alaska Clean Seas and Ship Escort/Response Ves sel System for the Alaska North Slope and Prince William Sound, respectively. Internationally, we maintain memberships in various regional OSROs including the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies, Australian Marine Oil Spill Center and Petroleum Industry of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group. Technology We have several technology programs that improve our ability to develop unconventional reservoirs, produce heavy oil economically with less emissions, improve the efficiency of our exploration program, increase recoveries from our legacy fields, and implement sustainability measures. We are the second largest LNG liquefaction technology provider globally. Our Optimized Cascade® LNG liquefaction technology has been licensed for use in 27 LNG trains around the world, with feasibility studies ongoing for additional trains and four new products announced in 2020 that expand the scope of LNG licensing. RESERVES We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2020. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year-end 2019 and year-end 2018, which are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2020. DELIVERY COMMITMENTS We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 156 million barrels of crude oil in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2030. We expect to fulfill these delivery commitments with third-party purchases, as supported by our gas management agreements; proved developed 18 reserves; and PUDs. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in the “Oil and Gas Operations” section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of PUDs. COMPETITION We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the E&P business. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominating. We compete with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, NGLs and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on statistics published in the September 7, 2020, issue of the Oil and Gas Journal, we were the third-largest U.S.-based oil and gas company in worldwide liquids production and reserves and one of the top ten U.S. companies measured by worldwide natural gas production and reserves in 2019. We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Values, Principles and Governance At ConocoPhillips, our human capital management approach is anchored to our core SPIRIT Values. Our SPIRIT Values – Safety, People, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, and Teamwork – set the tone for how we interact with all our stakeholders, internally and externally. In particular, we believe a safe organization is a successful organization, so we prioritize personal and process safety across the company. Our SPIRIT Values are a source of pride. Our day-to-day work is guided by the principles of accountability and performance, which means the way we do our work is as important as the results we deliver. We believe these core values and principles set us apart, align our workforce and provide a foundation for our culture. Our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and our Board of Directors play a key role in setting our human capital management philosophies and tracking our progress. The ELT and Board of Directors engage often on workforce-related topics. Our human capital management programs are overseen and administered by our human resources function with support from business leaders across the company. We depend on our workforce to successfully execute our company’s strategy and we recognize the importance of creating a workplace in which our people feel valued. We take a broad view of human capital management that begins with offering a compelling culture and includes programs and processes necessary for ensuring we have an engaged workforce with the skills to meet our business needs. The key elements of our human capital management are described below. COVID-19 Response In 2020, a significant effort was undertaken to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the very early stages of the pandemic, we adopted and embraced three company-wide priorities to guide our activities in the midst of COVID-19: to protect our employees, mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and safely run the business. We have pursued these priorities via a coordinated crisis management support team, frequent workforce communications and flexible programs to suit the challenging environment. We transitioned to a remote work environment for periods of time to ensure the safety of our employees, partners and the community, and then implemented rigorous cleaning and disinfecting processes and rigorous mitigation protocols to keep our workforce safe, including temperature scans, social distancing, face covering requirements and increased sanitation as employees returned to the office setting. 19 Culture of Feedback and Engagement Our human capital management approach recognizes that a compelling culture and an engaged workforce are powerful determinants of business success. Beginning in 2019, we launched a coordinated, multi-year, global employee feedback program called “Perspectives.” In mid-2019 we administered our first Perspectives survey, which received an 86 percent employee response rate and yielded more than 35,000 comments. We achieved an employee satisfaction score that, on a 100-point scale, was 5 points higher than general industry and 11 points higher than our energy peers who used the same platform. Importantly, the quantitative and qualitative survey data were used by leaders across the company to identify and analyze relative strengths and gaps and to develop action plans to address gaps. We intended to repeat the comprehensive Perspectives survey in 2020; however, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant industry downturn, we elected to defer the full survey until 2021 and instead focused our 2020 feedback program on the specific topic of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I). The survey “Perspectives Pulse: D&I” also received a high response rate with over 10,000 comments. The ELT and an internal D&I Council are responsible for analyzing the survey data to identify D&I strengths and gaps, and to use the findings to establish 2021 D&I priorities and action plans. The company’s D&I commitment, activities and programs are described below. Diversity and Inclusion Our commitment to D&I is foundational to our SPIRIT Values and our stated company-wide D&I goal is to have “a diverse culture of belonging where everyone feels valued.” We believe a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment that reflects different backgrounds, experiences, ideas and perspectives drives innovation, employee satisfaction and overall company performance. We hold our entire workforce accountable for creating and sustaining an inclusive work environment. Our leaders are accountable for having personal D&I goals each year and we believe senior leadership involvement is critical for achieving meaningful progress on D&I. The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our D&I commitment through a governance structure that includes an ELT-level D&I Champion, a global D&I Council consisting of senior leaders from across the company and organization-wide D&I goals. Leaders meet regularly with each other and with the workforce to discuss challenges, opportunities, best practices and progress. In addition, our D&I plans and progress are reviewed regularly with the Board of Directors. In 2018, the company established three pillars to guide our D&I activities: leadership accountability, employee awareness, and processes and programs. Since then, we have established corporate priorities annually under each of these areas. In 2020 we also published our first D&I Annual Report internally and we expect to update this report periodically as an important part of holding ourselves accountable for progressing our D&I goals throughout ConocoPhillips. Some of our key D&I actions and accomplishments over the past few years include: ● Publishing our first D&I Dashboards internally which contain key D&I statistics for our global and U.S. employees at year-end for the periods 2015-2019; ● Launching a company-wide platform for our workforce to talk openly about D&I ● Expanding our workforce recognition programs to include a prestigious “SPIRIT Award” for D&I advocates; ● Implementing a “how rating” and an upward feedback process as part of our performance management system to hold our workforce and our leaders accountable for D&I ● Broadening our D&I-related training resources; and ● Advocating for broad participation in, and awareness of our extensive network of employee resource groups, which drew participation from over 5,000 people in 2020. 20 We recognize that achieving our D&I goals require the visible actions described above, but also requires a clear linkage to the daily activities of our workforce. These activities include: ● Educating managers on inclusive hiring practices; ● Conducting immersive D&I training for senior leaders and influencers; ● Examining our Talent Management Teams’ processes to eradicate bias within our selection and succession efforts; ● Working with partners to connect veterans and individuals with disabilities with employment; ● Promoting inclusion of employees with disabilities through a robust accommodation process available to all employees; ● Ensuring diverse internal and external candidate slates; and ● Creating balanced interview teams to mitigate any unconscious bias in our hiring processes. We actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. In addition to our internal dashboards, we publicly report our representation of women and minorities in leadership roles. We have also committed to publicly disclose ConocoPhillips’ Consolidated EEO-1 Report effective upon our next submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2021. Tables of 2020 employee demographics by gender and ethnicity, and by country, are shown below: 2020 Employees by Gender* and Ethnicity Male Female Non-POC ** POC All Employees 73 % 27 % 75 % 25 % All Leadership 77 23 81 19 Top Leadership 81 19 87 13 Junior Leadership 76 24 78 22 *While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities. **""POC"" refers to People of Color or racial and ethnic minorities self-reported in the U.S. Note: percentages based on year-end 2020 employee count of 9,700. 2020 Employees by Country Percent of Total USA 59 % Norway 19 Canada 8 Indonesia 6 Great Britain 3 Australia 3 China 1 Other Global Locations 1 100 Our human capital management approach addresses programs and processes necessary for ensuring an engaged workforce with the skills to meet our business needs. We take a holistic view of human capital management that addresses each of the critical components of workforce planning. These are described in more detail below. Hiring & Retention Our success depends on having the right workforce to meet our business needs. Attracting and retaining a skilled, engaged and diverse workforce is a top priority. We conduct routine personnel needs assessments with leaders to ensure we have the organizational capacity and capabilities to execute our business plans. We’ve 21 taken significant steps to embed inclusion into each step of our recruiting practices, including adapting the way we construct job descriptions to using intentionally diverse interview panels. To attract qualified, diverse candidates for full-time positions or internships, we recruit from a number of universities in the U.S. By attending conferences and recruiting at Hispanic-serving institutions and historically black colleges and universities, we have extended a broader outreach to potential diverse candidates. We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our university dashboards in areas such as gender, ethnicity and university acceptance rates to help guide decisions and best practices. These are disclosed internally through our D&I Dashboards to ensure greater transparency. In addition, voluntary turnover metrics are routinely tracked and disclosed to guide our retention activities, as necessary. 2020 Hiring & Retention Metrics (U.S.) Percent of Total University hire acceptance 85 % Interns acceptance 74 Diversity hiring - Women 29 Diversity hiring - POC 28 Total voluntary attrition 3 Talent Development We employ a comprehensive approach for ensuring our workforce is adequately prepared for their responsibilities and also to advance their career. Our workforce is trained through a combination of on-the-job learning, formal training, regular feedback and mentoring. Skill-based Talent Management Teams (TMTs) guide employee development and career progression by skills and location. The TMTs help identify our future business needs and assess the availability of critical skill sets within the company. We use a performance management program focused on objectivity, credibility and transparency. The program includes broad stakeholder feedback, real-time recognition and a formal rating to assess behaviors to ensure they are in line with our SPIRIT values. ConocoPhillips has established core leadership competencies that provide a common baseline of knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors to support employee performance, growth, and success. All supervisors have access to a voluntary 360-feedback tool to receive feedback on their strengths and opportunities relative to these competencies. We offer training on a broad range of technical and professional skills, from data analytics to communication skills. Compensation, Benefits and Well-Being We offer competitive, performance-based compensation packages and have global equitable pay practices. Our compensation programs are generally comprised of a base pay rate, the annual Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) and, for eligible employees, the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) program. From the CEO to the frontline worker, every employee participates in VCIP, our annual incentive program, which aligns employee compensation with ConocoPhillips’ success on critical performance metrics and also recognizes individual performance. Our RSU program is designed to attract and retain employees, reward performance, and align employee interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership. Our retirement and savings plans are intended to support employee’s financial futures and are competitive within local markets. We routinely benchmark our global compensation and benefits programs to ensure they are competitive, inclusive, aligned with company culture, and allow our employees to meet their individual needs and the needs of their families. We provide flexible work schedules and competitive time off, including parental leave policies in many locations. In 2020, our U.S. parental leave benefit increased from two weeks to six weeks and combined with our maternity benefit (eight weeks), new birth mothers are eligible for up to 14 weeks of paid leave. 22 Our global wellness programs include biometric screenings and fitness challenges designed to educate and promote a healthy lifestyle. All employees have access to our employee assistance program, and many of our locations offer custom programs to support mental well-being. Compensation Risk Mitigation ConocoPhillips has considered the risks associated with each of its executive and broad-based compensation programs and policies. As part of the analysis, we considered the performance measures we use, as well as the different types of compensation, varied performance measurement periods, and extended vesting schedules utilized under each incentive compensation program. As a result of this review, management concluded the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. As part of the Board of Directors’ oversight of ConocoPhillips’ risk management programs, the Human Resources Compensation Committee (HRCC) conducts a similar review with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant. The HRCC agrees with management’s conclusion that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. GENERAL At the end of 2020, we held a total of 1,038 active patents in 50 countries worldwide, including 419 active U.S. patents. During 2020, we received 65 patents in the U.S. and 69 foreign patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $16 million related to activity in 2020. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession. Health, Safety and Environment Our HSE organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class HSE performance. The framework through which we safely manage our operations, the HSE Management System Standard, emphasizes process safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and environmental performance, with an intense focus on process and occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, HSE milestones and criteria are established annually to drive strong safety and environmental performance. Progress toward these milestones and criteria are measured and reported. HSE audits are conducted on business functions periodically, and improvement actions are established and tracked to completion. We have designed processes relating to sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues. The environmental information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 64 through 69 under the captions “Environmental” and “Climate Change” is incorporated herein by reference.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. If any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Industry We have been negatively affected and may continue to be negatively affected by the prolonged drop in commodity prices that began in early 2020. The oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business and our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG. Such prices can fluctuate widely depending upon global events or conditions that affect supply and demand, most of which are out of our control. Since early 2020, there has been a precipitous decrease in demand for oil globally, largely caused by the dramatic decrease in travel and commerce resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information on commodity prices and how we have been impacted. There is no assurance of when or if commodity prices will return to pre-COVID-19 levels, and if they do return to pre-COVID levels, how long they will remain at those levels. The speed and extent of any recovery remains uncertain and is subject to various risk factors, including the duration, impact and actions taken to stem the proliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which those nations party to the OPEC plus production agreement decide to increase production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs and other factors described herein. Even after a recovery, our industry will continue to be exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices given the volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment generally, as well as continued uncertainty caused by armed hostilities in various oil-producing regions around the globe. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGL and LNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock. As a result of the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, we suspended our share repurchase program. Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically, thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields. Prolonged depressed crude oil prices may affect certain decisions related to our operations, including decisions to reduce capital investments or curtail operated production. Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves. In 2020, we recognized several impairments, which are described in Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, due to changes in assumptions for commodity prices and development plans. If the outlook for commodity prices remains low relative to historic levels, and as we continue to optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairments to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method and unproved properties. If oil and gas prices persist at depressed levels, our reserve estimates may decrease further, which could incrementally increase the rate used to determine DD&A expense on our unit-of-production method properties. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further examination of DD&A rate impacts versus comparative periods. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments or estimated change to our unit-of-production rates at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result. 24 Our business has been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to address it have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, reduced global demand for oil and gas, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, as a result of the pandemic and its broad reach across the entire economy, the U.S. entered a recession in early 2020 and the timing, pace and extent of the recovery is still unknown. Public health officials have recommended or mandated certain precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel and issuing “social or physical distancing” guidelines, “shelter-in-place” orders and mandatory closures or reductions in capacity for non-essential businesses. Although some of these limitations and mandates have been relaxed in certain jurisdictions, others have been reinstated in areas that have experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. In addition, despite approval of vaccines to immunize against COVID-19, the speed at which such vaccinations will be available to the public, the public’s willingness to be inoculated and the effectiveness of the vaccine (including to variants) still remain unknown. As a result, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and will depend on the severity, location and duration of the effects and spread of the disease, the effectiveness and duration of actions taken by authorities to contain the virus or treat its effect, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or other treatments, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve. We have already been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information on how we have been impacted and the steps we have taken in response. Our business is likely to continue to be further negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts could include but are not limited to: ● Continued reduced demand for our products as a result of prolonged reductions in travel and commerce, even if restrictions are lifted; ● Disruptions in our supply chain due in part to scrutiny or embargoing of shipments from infected areas or invocation of force majeure clauses in commercial contracts due to restrictions imposed as a result of the global response to the pandemic; ● Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties or restrictions imposed in response to the disease outbreak; ● Reduced workforce productivity caused by, but not limited to, illness, travel restrictions, quarantine, or government mandates; ● Business interruptions resulting from a portion of our workforce continuing to telecommute, as well as the implementation and maintenance of protections for employees commuting for work, such as personnel screenings and self-quarantines before or after travel; and ● Voluntary or involuntary curtailments to support oil prices or alleviate storage shortages for our products. Any of these factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our revenues and damage our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position. Despite the rollout of vaccines, the pandemic continues to progress and evolve, and the full extent and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted at this time because of the sweeping impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life around the world and a lack of certainty as to if or when conditions will return to pre-COVID levels. 25 Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business. The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. If we do not conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, and our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations. Any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result of commodity price declines may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserves. The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry. The exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highly competitive business. We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential sources of supply. In addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage when competing with state-owned companies if they are motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions, with less emphasis on financial returns. If we are not successful in our competition for new reserves, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves. Our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management’s best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Our business may be adversely affected by price controls, government-imposed limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. As discussed herein, our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wells below actual production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us. Our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG that we produce also depends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for transport. The facilities, equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells, and construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment. If any facilities, equipment or diluents, or any of the transportation methods and channels that we 26 rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas or NGLs. Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk. We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations, acquisitions or dispositions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations. Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight. The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, armed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyber attacks. Our operations may also be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services or infrastructure required to develop, produce, process or transport our production, such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure. Our operations are subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. Offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Further, our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. Legal and Regulatory Risks We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations. For a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the “Contingencies—Environmental” and “Contingencies—Climate Change” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things: ● Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities, including those issued by national, subnational, and local authorities; ● The discharge of pollutants into the environment; ● Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions; ● Carbon taxes; ● The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; ● The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives; and ● Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays. 27 We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. Any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third-party litigation against us. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected. Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on GHG emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the U.S. previously withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the new administration has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced their intention to satisfy these commitments. In addition, our operations continue in countries around the world which are party to, and have not announced an intent to withdraw from, the Paris Agreement. The implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and GHG emissions, may adversely impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emission of GHGs from our operations. As a result, we may experience declines in commodity prices or incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In October 2020, we announced the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework, whereby we committed to a reduction of our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity, with an ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 from operated emissions. We also endorsed the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, with an ambition to meet that goal by 2025 and reaffirmed our commitment to advocate for reduction of scope 3 emissions intensity through our support for a U.S. carbon price. Compliance with, and achievement of, climate change related internal initiatives such as the foregoing may increase costs, require us to purchase emission credits, or limit or impact our business plans, potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end-of-field life of certain assets and an impairment of the associated net book value. Increasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure upon stockholders, financial institutions and/or financial markets to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit investments and/or funding to such companies. For example, in 2019 Norway’s Government Pension Fund announced it would reduce its investment exposure to companies that explore for oil and gas, and in 2020 a number of major financial institutions announced that they would no longer finance oil and gas exploration projects in the Arctic. As public pressure continues to mount, our access to capital on terms we find favorable (if it is available at all) may be limited and our costs may increase or our business and results of operations may be otherwise adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Beginning in 2017, cities, counties, governments and other entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed. The amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented. ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will 28 vigorously defend against such lawsuits. The ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. In addition, although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the earth’s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be adversely impacted, and demand for our products could fall. For more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company’s response, see the “Contingencies—Climate Change” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the U.S. and abroad. In certain locations, restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries have been imposed or proposed by governments or certain interest groups. For example, in 2020 a ballot initiative known as the Fair Share Act was proposed in the state of Alaska, which, if enacted would have increased the state’s share of production revenues and required producers to publicly disclose additional financial information. Although ultimately defeated, similar initiatives may be proposed and may be successful in the future. The change in control of Congress and the White House because of the 2020 election increases the possibility of the promulgation of more stringent regulations of our operations and the enactment of tax law changes that may adversely affect the fossil fuel industry. In addition, the current administration may use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the regulations finalized in the last five months of the prior administration. We also cannot rule out the possibility of similar regulatory shifts and attendant cost and market access implications in other international jurisdictions. One area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted safely for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted or are considering regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, including subsurface water disposal. On January 27, 2021, the new administration signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on federal lands, allowing time to review and reset the Federal Government’s oil and gas leasing program. Existing production and permits already issued on Federal lands were not impacted by this order. If this temporary moratorium were to be extended indefinitely, we believe we can mitigate the impact for a considerable period of time with our current permits and adjusting our development plans across our diverse acreage position. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event that ballot initiatives, local, state, or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance 29 costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in domestic and international policies and regulations may affect our ability to collect payments such as those pertaining to the settlement with PDVSA or the ICSID Award against the Government of Venezuela; or to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development of wells in various locations. Similarly, the declaration of a “climate emergency” could result in actions to limit exports of our products and other restrictions. Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 48 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the U.S. in 2020, and 42 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2020, were located outside the U.S. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, NGLs or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments (including the macro effects of international trade policies and disputes), potentially disruptive geopolitical conditions, and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations. In addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system. This, coupled with changes in foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations. Risks Related to Our Acquisition of Concho Combining our business with Concho’s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which may adversely affect our business results and negatively affect the value of our common stock. Our acquisition of Concho (the Merger) involved the combination of two companies which, until the completion of the Merger, operated as independent public companies. The success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of our two companies to combine our businesses in a manner that adds value to shareholders. However, there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully, and we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration process. We must achieve the anticipated improvement in free cash flow generation and returns and achieve the planned cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues or compromising the disciplined investment philosophy to maximize value for shareholders. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations and technologies and systems that must be integrated, and although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the business, may offset incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time, we may encounter difficulties in the integration and any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. It is possible that the integration process could take longer than originally anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees; the loss of commercial and vendor partners; the disruption of our ongoing businesses; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; unexpected integration issues; and higher than expected integration costs. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of ConocoPhillips, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock. 30 The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold now that the Concho acquisition has been consummated. We issued shares of ConocoPhillips common stock to former Concho stockholders. Former Concho stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of ConocoPhillips common stock that they received in the Merger, and ConocoPhillips stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in ConocoPhillips as a result of the changes to ConocoPhillips’ investment profile as a result of the Merger. Other Concho stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of ConocoPhillips common stock that they received in the Merger. Such sales of ConocoPhillips common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for ConocoPhillips common stock. Other Risk Factors Facing our Business or Operations We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital markets for funding. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans, will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. We and other industry companies have had their ratings reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlooks. Any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur. Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties with whom we do business. The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. Market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly as it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry as a result of the volatility in commodity prices. Any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. We may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations. In particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) providing for the payment of approximately $2 billion over a five-year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips on a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela’s expropriation of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures. We have collected approximately $0.8 billion of the $2.0 billion settlement to date and PDVSA has defaulted on its remaining payment obligations under 31 this agreement. We are therefore incurring additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the agreement. Additionally, in March 2019, an ICSID arbitration tribunal issued an award unanimously ordering the government of Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips approximately $8.7 billion in compensation for the government’s unlawful expropriation of the company’s investments in Venezuela in 2007. ConocoPhillips has filed requests for recognition of the award in several jurisdictions. On August 29, 2019, the ICSID tribunal issued a decision rectifying the award and reducing it by approximately $227 million. The award now stands at $8.5 billion plus interest. The government of Venezuela is seeking annulment of the award before another panel at ICSID and annulment proceedings are underway. No amounts have been collected as a result of this award yet. Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations. Dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including: ● Cash available for distribution; ● Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations; ● Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties; ● The level of distributions paid by comparable companies; ● Our operating expenses; and ● Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time, including if it determines that our net cash provided by operating activities, after deducting capital expenditures and investments, are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase program our Board of Directors had authorized. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our Board of Directors may consider when declaring dividends, among others. In the past we have suspended our share repurchase program in response to market downturns, and we may do so again in the future. Any downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders or the number of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. There are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we may choose to undertake. We regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core assets or businesses. We may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we do complete such transactions, our cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted or otherwise the transactions may not result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to (i) the failure of the acquired assets or businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or businesses; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections are inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities, including environmental liabilities, or with regard to divested assets or businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. 32 Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cyber attacks. Our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, some of which are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. Among other activities, we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third-parties. As a result, we face various cyber security threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees, attempts to render our data or systems (or those of third-parties with whom we do business) corrupted or unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third-parties with whom we do business and attempted cyber terrorism. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure, or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage critical production, distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Although we have experienced occasional breaches of our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must continually expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities detected. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures will be effective. If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to be decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to SEC regulations. On April 30, 2012, the separation of our downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement, which provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and 33 established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters, such as legal proceedings. We have included matters where we remain or have subsequently become a party to a proceeding relating to Phillips 66, in accordance with SEC regulations. We do not expect any of those matters to result in a net claim against us. Matters Previously Reported—Phillips 66 In May 2012, the Illinois Attorney General's office filed and notified ConocoPhillips of a complaint with respect to operations at the Phillips 66 WRB Wood River Refinery alleging violations of the Illinois groundwater standards and a third-party's hazardous waste permit. The complaint seeks remediation of area groundwater; compliance with the hazardous waste permit; enhanced pipeline and tank integrity measures; additional spill reporting; and yet-to-be specified amounts for fines and penalties.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an independent E&P company with operations and activities in 15 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe and Asia; LNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 9,700 people worldwide and had total assets of $63 billion. Completed Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. On January 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations across New Mexico and West Texas. The addition of complementary acreage in the Delaware and Midland Basins creates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48 and the Montney in Canada. Consideration for the all-stock transaction was valued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock was exchanged for each outstanding share of Concho common stock, resulting in the issuance of approximately 286 million shares of ConocoPhillips common stock. We also assumed $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for Concho, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7 billion as of the closing date. The combined companies are expected to capture approximately $750 million of annual cost and capital savings by 2022. For additional information related to this transaction, see Note 25—Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview The energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with simultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove the industry into a severe downturn. The demand shock was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to have unprecedented social and economic consequences. Mitigation efforts to stop the spread of this highly-contagious disease include stay-at-home orders and business closures that caused sharp contractions in economic activity worldwide. The supply shock was triggered by disagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020, which resulted in significant supply coming onto the 38 market and an oil price war. These dual demand and supply shocks caused oil prices to collapse as we exited the first quarter of 2020. As we entered the second quarter of 2020, predictions of COVID-19 driven global oil demand losses intensified, with forecasts of unprecedented demand declines. Based on these forecasts, OPEC plus nations held an emergency meeting, and in April they announced a coordinated production cut that was unprecedented in both its magnitude and duration. The OPEC plus agreement spans from May 2020 until April 2022, with the volume of production cuts easing over time. Additionally, non-OPEC plus countries, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil and other G-20 countries, announced organic reductions to production through the release of drilling rigs, frac crews, normal field decline and curtailments. Despite these planned production decreases, the supply cuts were not timely enough to overcome significant demand decline. Futures prices for April WTI closed under $20 a barrel for the first time since 2001, followed by May WTI settling below zero on the day before futures contracts expiry, as holders of May futures contracts struggled to exit positions and avoid taking physical delivery. As storage constraints approached, spot prices in April for certain North American landlocked grades of crude oil were in the single digits or even negative for particularly remote or low-grade crudes, while waterborne priced crudes such as Brent sold at a relative advantage. The extreme volatility experienced in the first half of the year settled down in the second half of the year, with WTI crude oil prices exiting the year near $50 per barrel. Since the start of the severe downturn, we have closely monitored the market and taken prudent actions in response to this situation. We entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of more than $5 billion, short-term investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately $14 billion in available liquidity. Additionally, we had several entity and asset sales agreements in place, which generated $1.3 billion in proceeds from dispositions during 2020. For more information about the sales of our Australia-West and non-core Lower 48 assets, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This relative advantage allowed us to be measured in our response to the sudden change in business environment. In March, we announced an initial set of actions to address the downturn and followed up with additional actions in April. The combined announcements reflected a reduction in our 2020 operating plan capital of $2.3 billion, a reduction to our operating costs of $600 million and suspension of our share repurchase program. These actions decreased uses of cash by approximately $5 billion in 2020. We also established a framework for evaluating our assets and implementing economic production curtailments considering the weakness in oil prices during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in taking an additional significant step of voluntarily curtailing production, predominantly from operated North American assets. Due to our strong balance sheet, we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher cash flows for those volumes in the future. In the second quarter, we curtailed production by an estimated 225 MBOED, with 145 MBOED of the curtailments from the Lower 48, 40 MBOED from Alaska and 30 MBOED from our Surmont operation in Canada. The remainder of the second-quarter curtailments were primarily in Malaysia. Other industry operators also cut production and development plans and as we progressed through the second quarter, certain stay-at-home restrictions eased, which partially restored lost demand, and WTI and Brent prices exited the second quarter around $40 per barrel. Based on our economic framework, we began restoring production from voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we ended our curtailment program during the third quarter. Curtailments in the third quarter averaged approximately 90 MBOED, with 65 MBOED attributable to the Lower 48 and 15 MBOED to Surmont. In August 2020, we acquired additional Montney acreage for cash consideration of $382 million, after customary post-closing adjustments. We also assumed $31 million in financing obligations for associated partially owned infrastructure. This acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped properties and included 140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed asset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent to our existing Montney position. The transaction increased our Montney acreage position to approximately 295,000 net acres with a 100 percent working interest. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 39 In October 2020, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share and resumed share repurchases before suspending our share repurchase program upon entry into our definitive agreement to acquire Concho. We resumed shares repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho acquisition. We ended the year with over $12 billion of liquidity, comprised of $3.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $3.6 billion in short-term investments, and available borrowings under our credit facility of $5.7 billion. Our expectation is that commodity prices will remain cyclical and volatile, and a successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments, at the same time retaining upside during periods of higher prices. While we are not impervious to current market conditions, we believe our decisive actions over the last several years of focusing on free cash flow generation, high-grading our asset base, lowering the cost of supply of our investment resource portfolio, and strengthening our balance sheet have put us in a strong relative position compared to our independent E&P peers. We remain committed to the core principles of our value proposition, namely, free cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, commitment to differential returns of and on capital, and ESG leadership. Our workforce and operations have adjusted to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have operations in remote areas with confined spaces, such as offshore platforms, the North Slope of Alaska, Curtis Island in Australia, western Canada and Indonesia, where viruses could rapidly spread. Personnel are asked to perform a self-assessment for symptoms of illness each day and, when appropriate, are subject to more restrictive measures before traveling to and working on location. Staffing levels in certain operating locations have been reduced to minimize health risk exposure and increase social distancing. A portion of our office staff have continued to work successfully remotely, with offices around the world carefully designing and executing a flexible, phased reentry, following national, state and local guidelines. These mitigation measures have thus far been effective at reducing business operation disruptions. Workforce health and safety remains the overriding driver for our actions and we have demonstrated our ability to adapt to local conditions as warranted. The marketing and supply chain side of our business has also adapted in response to COVID-19. Our commercial organization managed transportation commitments during our voluntary curtailment program. Our supply chain function is proactively working with vendors to ensure the continuity of our business operations, monitor distressed service and materials providers, capture deflation opportunities, and pursue cost reduction efforts. We also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period and requested credit assurances when applicable. Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. In 2020, production of 1,127 MBOED generated cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion. We invested $4.7 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $0.5 billion of acquisition capital, and paid dividends to shareholders of $1.8 billion. Production decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent in 2020, compared to 2019. Production excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED. Adjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions and dispositions; and excluding Libya, production for 2020 would have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared with 2019 production. This decrease was primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China. Production from Libya averaged 9 MBOED as it was in force majeure during a significant portion of the year. Key Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2020 and recent announcements included the following: ● Enhanced both our portfolio and financial framework through the acquisition of Concho in an all-stock transaction, as well as purchasing bolt-on acreage in Canada and Lower 48. ● Full-year production, excluding Libya, of 1,118 MBOED; curtailed approximately 80 MBOED during the year. 40 ● Cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion. ● Generated $1.3 billion in disposition proceeds from non-core asset sales. ● Distributed $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $0.9 billion of shares. ● Ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.0 billion and short-term investments of $3.6 billion, equaling $6.6 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. ● Announced two significant discoveries in Norway and achieved first production at Tor II; continued appraisal drilling and started up first pads and related infrastructure in Montney. ● Adopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with ambition to achieve net -zero operated emissions by 2050 as part of our commitment to ESG excellence. ● Recognized impairments of proved and unproved properties totaling $1.3 billion after-tax. Business Environment Brent crude oil prices averaged $42 per barrel in 2020, compared with $64 per barrel in 2019. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the foundational principles that underpin our value proposition; free cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, commitment to differential returns of and on capital, and ESG leadership. Operational and Financial Factors Affecting Profitability The focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include: ● Free cash flow generation. This is a core principle of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production. Throughout the price cycles, we expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production. Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our priorities through the price cycles, or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion. o Maintain capital allocation discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low production decline. Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price related inflation and G&A. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using this cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth’s sake. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend. Additional capital may be allocated toward growth, but discipline will be maintained. In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating plan capital for the combined company of $5.5 billion. The plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current production and $0.4 billion for investment in major projects, primarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration appraisal activity. The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion is expected to deliver production from the combined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021. This production guidance excludes Libya. 41 o Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. In 2020, our production and operating expenses were 18 percent lower than 2019, primarily due to decreased wellwork and transportation costs resulting from production curtailments across our North American operated assets as well as the absence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures. For more information related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures, see note 4—Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At the time of the Concho acquisition announcement in October 2020, we announced planned cost reductions and quantified $350 million of annual expense savings expected to be achieved by 2022. These reductions included approximately $150 million due to streamlining our internal organization to appropriate levels given the current industry environment and recent asset sales; $100 million of G&A and G&G due to a refocused exploration program; and $100 million of redundant G&A costs on a combined basis related to the Concho acquisition. Subsequent to the transaction announcement, we identified $250 million of further cost reductions from the combined companies to be achieved by 2022. o Optimize our portfolio. In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and significantly increased our unconventional portfolio with years of low cost of supply investments. The addition of complementary acreage in the Delaware and Midland basins creates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48. We added to our unconventional Montney position with an asset acquisition that consisted primarily of undeveloped properties directly adjacent to our existing acreage. These acquisitions followed several non-core asset sales earlier in the year including Australia-West in our Asia Pacific segment, and Niobrara and Waddell Ranch in the Lower 48. We managed the portfolio well during a turbulent year, with asset sales entered at the end of 2019 generating $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions in the first half of 2020, followed by opportunistic acquisitions of unconventional assets in the second half of 2020 after commodity prices had dropped. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments. ● A strong balance sheet. We believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. Our strong operating performance buffered by a solid balance sheet enables us to deliver on our priorities through the price cycles. Our priorities include execution of our development plans, maintaining a growing dividend, and returning competitive returns of capital to shareholders. ● Commitment to differential returns of and on capital. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend supplemented by additional returns of capital, including share repurchases. In 2020, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.8 billion and repurchased $0.9 billion of our common stock. Combined, our dividend and repurchases represented 57 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. Since we initiated our current share repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased 189 million shares for $10.5 billion, which represents approximately 15 percent of shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase program our Board of Directors had authorized. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, 42 at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” In October 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share. In February 2021, we resumed share repurchases after the completion of our Concho acquisition. ● ESG Leadership. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, in October 2020, we announced our adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework as part of our continued leadership in ESG excellence. This comprehensive climate risk strategy should enable us to sustainably meet global energy demand while delivering competitive returns through the energy transition. We have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, with an ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 for operated emissions. We are advocating for reduction of scope 3 end-use emissions intensity through our support for a U.S. carbon price and reaffirmed our commitment to the Climate Leadership Council. We have joined the World Bank Flaring Initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030 and are the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy. ● Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Purchases of increased interests in existing fields and acquisitions. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields. As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. Our reserve replacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower prices, which reduced reserves by approximately 600 MMBOE. Our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net decrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was negative 84 percent in 2020. In the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve replacement was 59 percent, primarily impacted by lower prices in 2020. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2020, which excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 53 percent. Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. 43 ● Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. Companywide, we continue to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations. We have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to work and operate more efficiently. Predictive analytics have been adopted in our operations and planning process. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are being used for emissions monitoring, seismic advancements and advanced controls in our field operations. ● Attract, develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to successfully execute our business strategy in a manner exemplifying our core values and ethics. We offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best early career talent. We also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad range of expertise and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees. Other Factors Affecting Profitability Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: ● Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. Industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC and other producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Brent crude oil prices averaged $41.68 per barrel in 2020, a decrease of 35 percent compared with $64.30 per barrel in 2019. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 31 percent from $57.02 per barrel in 2019 to $39.37 per barrel in 2020. Crude oil prices were lower due to the dual demand and supply shocks. The demand shock was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to have unprecedented social and economic consequences. The supply shock was triggered by 44 disagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020, which resulted in significant supply coming onto the market and created higher inventory levels. Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased 21 percent from an average of $2.63 per MMBTU in 2019 to $2.08 per MMBTU in 2020. Henry Hub prices were depressed due to high storage levels and weak demand. Our realized bitumen price decreased 75 percent from an average of $31.72 per barrel in 2019 to $8.02 per barrel in 2020. The decrease was largely driven by weakness in WTI, reflective of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly flat as curtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government, which limited production from the province, continued throughout 2020. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through improvements in alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs and access to the U.S. Gulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts. Our worldwide annual average realized price decreased 34 percent from $48.78 per BOE in 2019 to $32.15 per BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized oil, natural gas and bitumen prices. North America’s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the U.S. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible. ● Impairments. We participate in a capital-intensive industry. At times, our PP&E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For additional information on our impairments, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Effective tax rate. Our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. ● Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity. 45 Outlook Production and Capital In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating plan capital for the combined company of $5.5 billion. The plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current production and $0.4 billion for investment in major projects, primarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration appraisal activity. The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion is expected to deliver production from the combined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021. This production guidance excludes Libya. Restructuring As a result of the acquisition of Concho, we commenced a restructuring program in the first quarter of 2021 in association with combining the operations of the two companies. We expect to incur significant non-recurring transaction and acquisition-related costs in 2021 for employee severance payments; incremental pension benefit costs related to the workforce reductions; employee retention costs; employee relocations; fees paid to financial, legal, and accounting advisors; and filing fees. We currently cannot estimate these costs, as well as other unanticipated items, and expect to recognize the majority of these expenses in the first quarter of 2021. Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International. Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production. 46 RESULTS OF OPERATIONSEffective with the third quarter of 2020, we have restructured our segments to align with changes to our internal organization. The Middle East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment to the Europe and North Africa segment. The segments have been renamed the Asia Pacific segment and the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. We have revised segment information disclosures and segment performance metrics presented within our results of operations for the current and prior years. This section of the Form 10-K discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. For discussion of year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Exhibit 99.1—, Item 7 filed with our Form 8-K filed on November 16, 2020. Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Alaska $ (719) 1,520 1,814 Lower 48 (1,122) 436 1,747 Canada (326) 279 63 Europe, Middle East and North Africa 448 3,170 2,594 Asia Pacific 962 1,483 1,342 Other International (64) 263 364 Corporate and Other (1,880) 38 (1,667) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ (2,701) 7,189 6,257 2020 vs. 2019 Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased $9.9 billion in 2020. The decrease was mainly due to: ● Lower realized commodity prices. ● Lower sales volumes due to normal field decline, asset dispositions and production curtailments. For additional information related to dispositions, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● The absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● An unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2020, as compared to a $649 million after-tax unrealized gain on those shares in 2019. ● A $648 million after-tax impairment for the associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs and an equity method investment related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset. For additional information, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Increased impairments primarily related to developed properties in our non-core assets which were written down to fair value due to lower commodity prices and development plan changes. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments and Note 14—Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● The absence of other income of $317 million after-tax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA. 47 These decreases in net income (loss) were partly offset by: ● Lower production and operating expenses, primarily due to the absence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures and decreased wellwork and transportation costs resulting from production curtailments across our North American operated assets. ● A $597 million after-tax gain on dispositions related to our Australia-West divestiture. ● Lower DD&A expenses, primarily due to lower volumes related to normal field decline and production curtailments as well as impacts of our Australia-West and U.K. divestitures. Partly offsetting this decrease, was higher DD&A expenses due to price-related downward reserve revisions. Income Statement Analysis 2020 vs. 2019 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 42 percent in 2020, mainly due to lower realized commodity prices and lower sales volumes. Sales volumes decreased due to normal field decline, production curtailments from our North American operated assets and the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third quarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $347 million in 2020, primarily due to lower earnings from QG3 and APLNG because of lower LNG prices. Partly offsetting this decrease was the absence of impairments related to equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment of $155 million and the absence of a $118 million deferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. Gain on dispositions decreased $1.4 billion in 2020, primarily due to the absence of a $1.7 billion before-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. Partly offsetting the decrease was a $587 million before-tax gain associated with our Australia-West divestiture. For more information related to these dispositions, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) decreased $1.9 billion in 2020, primarily due to a before-tax unrealized loss of $855 million on our CVE common shares in 2020, and the absence of a $649 million before-tax unrealized gain on those shares in 2019. Additionally, other income (loss) decreased due to the absence of $325 million before-tax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA. For discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 6—Investment in Cenovus Energy in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our PDVSA settlement, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchased commodities decreased 32 percent in 2020, primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil prices; lower crude oil and natural gas volumes purchased; and the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third quarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020. Production and operating expenses decreased $978 million in 2020, primarily due to reduced activities and transportation costs associated with lower activity across our North American operated assets in response to the low commodity price environment and the absence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $126 million in 2020, primarily due to lower costs associated with compensation and benefits, including mark to market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. 48 Exploration expenses increased $714 million in 2020, primarily due to an $828 million before-tax impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset. Partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of a $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment expense due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk trend. For additional information, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments increased $408 million in 2020, primarily related to developed properties in our non-core assets which were written down to fair value due to lower commodity prices and development plan changes. For additional information, see Note 8—Impairments and Note 14—Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $199 million in 2020, primarily due to lower commodity prices and volumes. Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $138 million in 2020, due to gains recognized from foreign currency derivatives and other foreign currency remeasurements. For additional information, see Note 13—Derivative and Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax provision (benefit) and effective tax rate. 49 Summary Operating Statistics 2020 2019 2018 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) Consolidated Operations 555 692 639 Equity affiliates 13 13 14 Total crude oil 568 705 653 Natural gas liquids (MBD) Consolidated Operations 97 107 95 Equity affiliates 8 8 7 Total natural gas liquids 105 115 102 Bitumen (MBD) 55 60 66 Natural gas (MMCFD) Consolidated Operations 1,339 1,753 1,743 Equity affiliates 1,055 1,052 1,031 Total natural gas 2,394 2,805 2,774 Total Production (MBOED)1,127 1,348 1,283 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per bbl) Consolidated Operations $ 39.56 60.98 68.03 Equity affiliates 39.02 61.32 72.49 Total crude oil 39.54 60.99 68.13 Natural gas liquids (per bbl) Consolidated Operations 12.90 18.73 29.03 Equity affiliates 32.69 36.70 45.69 Total natural gas liquids 14.61 20.09 30.48 Bitumen (per bbl) 8.02 31.72 22.29 Natural gas (per mcf) Consolidated Operations 3.17 4.25 5.40 Equity affiliates 3.71 6.29 6.06 Total natural gas 3.41 5.03 5.65 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical, lease rental, and other $ 374 322 274 Leasehold impairment 868 221 56 Dry holes 215 200 39 $ 1,457 743 369 50 We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2020, our operations were producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. 2020 vs. 2019 Total production, including Libya, of 1,127 MBOED decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to: ● Normal field decline. ● The divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third quarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020. ● Production curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED, primarily from North American operated assets and Malaysia, in response to the low crude oil price environment. ● Less production in Libya due to the forced shutdown of the Es Sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals after a period of civil unrest. The decrease in production during 2020 was partly offset by: ● New wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China. Production excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED. Adjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED and closed acquisitions and dispositions, production for 2020 would have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China. Production from Libya averaged 9 MBOED as it was in force majeure during a significant portion of the year. 51 Alaska 2020 2019 2018 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (719) 1,520 1,814 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 181 202 171 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 16 15 14 Natural gas (MMCFD) 10 7 6 Total Production (MBOED)198 218 186 Average Sales Prices Crude oil ($ per bbl) $ 42.12 64.12 70.86 Natural gas ($ per mcf) 2.91 3.19 2.48 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. In 2020, Alaska contributed 28 percent of our consolidated liquids production and less than 1 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 vs. 2019 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska reported a loss of $719 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $1,520 million in 2019. Earnings were negatively impacted by: ● Lower realized crude oil prices. ● A $648 million after-tax impairment associated with the carrying value of our Alaska North Slope Gas assets. For additional information, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Lower sales volumes, primarily due to normal field decline and production curtailments at our operated assets on the North Slope—the Greater Kuparuk Area (GKA) and Western North Slope (WNS). ● Higher DD&A expenses, primarily from increased DD&A rates due to price-related downward reserve revisions, partly offset by lower production volumes. ● Increased exploration expenses, primarily due to higher dry hole costs and expenses related to the early cancellation of our winter exploration program. Earnings were positively impacted by: ● Lower production and operating expenses, primarily associated with lower transportation and terminaling costs as well as lower activities across our assets. Production Average production decreased 20 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to: ● Normal field decline. ● Production curtailments at our operated assets on the North Slope—GKA and WNS—of 8 MBOED in response to the low crude oil price environment. These production decreases were partly offset by: ● Lower downtime due to the absence of planned turnarounds at the Greater Prudhoe Area. ● New wells online at our operated assets on the North Slope—GKA and WNS. 52 Lower 48 2020 2019 2018 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (1,122) 436 1,747 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 213 266 229 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 74 81 69 Natural gas (MMCFD) 585 622 596 Total Production (MBOED)385 451 397 Average Sales Prices Crude oil ($ per bbl) $ 35.17 55.30 62.99 Natural gas liquids ($ per bbl) 12.13 16.83 27.30 Natural gas ($ per mcf) 1.65 2.12 2.82 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2020, the Lower 48 contributed 40 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 44 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 vs. 2019 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Lower 48 reported a loss of $1,122 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $436 million in 2019. Earnings were negatively impacted by: ● Lower realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices. ● Lower crude oil sales volumes due to normal field decline and production curtailments. ● Higher impairments, primarily related to developed properties in our non-core assets which were written down to fair value due to lower commodity prices and development plan changes. See Note 8—Impairments and Note 14—Fair Value Measurement, for additional information. Earnings were positively impacted by: ● Lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of a combined $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the Central Louisiana Austin Chalk. ● Lower DD&A expenses, primarily due to normal field decline and production curtailments, partly offset by increased DD&A rates due to price-related downward reserve revisions. ● Lower production and operating expenses, primarily due to lower activities driven by production curtailments in response to the low price environment and disposition impacts. ● Lower taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to lower realized prices and volumes. Production Total average production decreased 66 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to: ● Normal field decline. ● Production curtailments of approximately 55 MBOED in response to the low crude oil price environment. These production decreases were partly offset by: ● New wells online from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. 53 Canada 2020* 2019** 2018** Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (326) 279 63 Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 6 1 1 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 2 - 1 Bitumen (MBD) 55 60 66 Natural gas (MMCFD) 40 9 12 Total Production (MBOED)70 63 70 Average Sales Prices Crude oil ($ per bbl) $ 23.57 40.87 48.73 Natural gas liquids ($ per bbl) 5.41 19.87 43.70 Bitumen ($ per bbl) 8.02 31.72 22.29 Natural gas ($ per mcf) 1.21 0.49 1.00 *Average sales prices include unutilized transportation costs. **Average prices for sales of bitumen produced excludes additional value realized from the purchase and sale of third-party volumes for optimization of our pipeline capacity between Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our Canadian operations consist of the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta and the liquids-rich Montney unconventional play in British Columbia. In 2020, Canada contributed 9 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 3 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 vs. 2019 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Canada operations reported a loss of $326 million in 2020 compared with earnings of $279 million in 2019. Earnings decreased mainly due to: ● Lower realized bitumen prices. ● Higher DD&A expenses, primarily due to increased volumes and DD&A rates from Montney production. ● Lower bitumen sales due to production curtailments at Surmont. Earnings were positively impacted by: ● Increased Montney production from Pad 1 & 2 wells online and partial year production from the Kelt acquisition completed in August of 2020. Production Total average production increased 7 MBOED in 2020 compared with 2019. The production increase was primarily due to: ● Increased liquids and natural gas production from Montney Pad 1 & 2 wells online and partial year production from the Kelt acquisition completed in August of 2020. ● Decreased mandated production curtailments imposed by the Alberta government. The production increase was partly offset by: ● Lower bitumen production, primarily due to voluntary curtailments at Surmont in response to the low price environment of 12 MBOED. 54 Europe, Middle East and North Africa 2020 2019* 2018* Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 448 3,170 2,594 Consolidated Operations Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 86 138 149 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 4 7 8 Natural gas (MMCFD) 275 478 503 Total Production (MBOED)136 224 241 Average Sales Prices Crude oil ($ per bbl) $ 43.30 64.94 70.71 Natural gas liquids ($ per bbl) 23.27 29.37 36.87 Natural gas ($ per mcf) 3.23 4.92 7.65 *Prior periods have been updated to reflect the Middle East Business Unit moving from Asia Pacific to the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment.

The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea; the Norwegian Sea; Qatar; Libya; and commercial and terminalling operations in the U.K. In 2020, our Europe, Middle East and North Africa operations contributed 13 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 20 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 vs. 2019 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips Earnings for Europe, Middle East and North Africa operations of $448 million decreased $2,722 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: ● The absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Lower equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to lower LNG sales prices. ● Lower realized crude oil prices in Norway. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate within our equity method investment in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment increased. Consolidated Production Average consolidated production decreased 88 MBOED in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was mainly due to: ● The absence of production related to our U.K. disposition in the third quarter of 2019. ● Lower volumes from Libya due to a cessation of production following a period of civil unrest. ● Normal field decline. These production decreases were partly offset by: ● New wells online in Norway. 55 Asia Pacific 2020 2019* 2018* Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ 962 1,483 1,342 Consolidated Operations Average Net Production Crude oil (MBD) 69 85 89 Natural gas liquids (MBD) 1 4 3 Natural gas (MMCFD) 429 637 626 Total Production (MBOED)141 196 196 Average Sales Prices Crude oil ($ per bbl) $ 42.84 65.02 70.93 Natural gas liquids ($ per bbl) 33.21 37.85 47.20 Natural gas ($ per mcf) 5.39 5.91 6.15 *Prior periods have been updated to reflect the Middle East Business Unit moving from Asia Pacific to the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. See Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Asia Pacific segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia. During 2020, Asia Pacific contributed 10 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 32 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 2020 vs. 2019 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips Asia Pacific reported earnings of $962 million in 2020, compared with $1,483 million in 2019. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to: ● Lower sales volumes, primarily from lower LNG sales due to the Australia-West divestiture; lower crude oil sales volumes in Malaysia, primarily due to production curtailments; and lower crude oil sales volumes in China due to the expiration of the Panyu production license. For more information related to our Australia-West divestiture, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Lower realized commodity prices. ● Lower equity in earnings of affiliates from APLNG, mainly due to lower LNG sales prices. ● The absence of a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits from the Malaysia Block G. Earnings were positively impacted by: ● A $597 million after-tax gain on disposition related to our Australia-West divestiture. Consolidated Production Average consolidated production decreased 28 percent in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to: ● The divestiture of our Australia-West assets. ● Normal field decline. ● Higher unplanned downtime due to the rupture of a third-party pipeline impacting gas production from the Kebabangan Field in Malaysia. ● The expiration of the Panyu production license in China. ● Production curtailments of 4 MBOED in Malaysia. 56 These production decreases were partly offset by: ● Development activity at Bohai Bay in China and Gumusut in Malaysia. Other International 2020 2019 2018 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (millions of dollars) $ (64) 263 364 The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia and Argentina and contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries. As a result of our completed Concho acquisition on January 15, 2021, we refocused our exploration program and announced our intent to pursue a managed exit from certain areas. 2020 vs. 2019 Other International operations reported a loss of $64 million in 2020, compared with earnings of $263 million in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: ● The absence of $317 million after-tax in other income from a settlement award with PDVSA associated with prior operations in Venezuela. For additional information related to this settlement award, see Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ● Increased exploration expenses, primarily due to dry hole costs and a full impairment of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs in Colombia. 57 Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2020 2019 2018 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (662) (604) (680) Corporate general and administrative expenses (200) (252) (91) Technology (26) 123 109 Other (992) 771 (1,005) $ (1,880) 38 (1,667) 2020 vs. 2019 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense increased $58 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower interest income related to lower cash and cash equivalent balances and yield. Corporate G&A expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These costs decreased by $52 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to mark to market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs. Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery and LNG. Earnings from Technology decreased by $149 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower licensing revenues. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense. Earnings in “Other” decreased by $1,763 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to: ● An unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax on our CVE common shares in 2020, compared with a $649 million after-tax unrealized gain in 2019. ● The absence of a $151 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 58 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,802 11,104 12,934 Cash and cash equivalents 2,991 5,088 5,915 Short-term investments 3,609 3,028 248 Short-term debt 619 105 112 Total debt 15,369 14,895 14,968 Total equity 29,849 35,050 32,064 Percent of total debt to capital* 34 % 30 32 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 7 % 5 5 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2020, the primary uses of our available cash were $4,715 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $1,831 million to pay dividends on our common stock; $892 million to repurchase our common stock; and $658 million for net purchase of investments. During 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,097 million to $2,991 million. We entered the year with a strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents of over $5 billion, short-term investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately $14 billion in available liquidity. This strong foundation allowed us to be measured in our response to the sudden change in business environment as we exited the first quarter of 2020. In response to the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, we announced the following capital, share repurchase and operating cost reductions. We reduced our 2020 operating plan capital expenditures by a total of $2.3 billion, or approximately thirty-five percent of the original guidance. We suspended our share repurchase program, further reducing cash outlays by approximately $2 billion. We also reduced our operating costs by approximately $0.6 billion, or roughly ten percent of the original 2020 guidance. Collectively, these actions represent a reduction in 2020 cash uses of approximately $5 billion versus the original operating plan. Considering the weakness in oil prices during the second quarter of 2020, we established a framework for evaluating and implementing economic curtailments, which resulted in taking an additional significant step of curtailing production, predominantly from operated North American assets. Due to our strong balance sheet, we were in an advantaged position to forgo some production and cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher cash flows for those volumes in the future. Based on our economic criteria, we began restoring production from voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil prices stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we ended our curtailment program by the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed share repurchases, repurchasing $0.2 billion of shares in October, before suspending our share repurchase program upon entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Concho. We resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion, short-term investments of $3.6 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.7 billion, totaling over $12 billion of liquidity. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments. 59 Significant Changes in Capital Operating Activities During 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $4,802 million, a 57 percent decrease from 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized commodity prices, normal field decline, production curtailments, the divestiture of our U.K. and Australia-West assets, and the absence in 2020 of collections under our settlement agreement with PDVSA, partially offset by lower production and operating expenses. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged 1,127 MBOED in 2020. Full-year production excluding Libya averaged 1,118 MBOED in 2020. Adjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions and dispositions; and excluding Libya; production for 2020 was 1,176 MBOED. Production in 2021 is expected to be approximately 1.5 MMBOED, reflecting the impact from the Concho acquisition. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. Our reserve replacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower prices, which reduced reserves by approximately 600 MMBOE. Our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net decrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was negative 84 percent in 2020. In the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve replacement was 59 percent, reflecting the impact of lower prices in 2020. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2020, which excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 53 percent. For additional information about our 2021 capital budget, see the “2021 Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report. As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. Investing Activities In 2020, we invested $4.7 billion in capital expenditures, of which $0.5 billion consisted of strategic acquisitions, including additional Montney acreage. Capital expenditures invested in 2019 and 2018 were $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section. 60 We invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. For additional information, see Note 1–Accounting Policies and Note 13–Derivative and Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities in 2020 included net purchases of $658 million of investments, of which $420 million was invested in short-term instruments and $238 million was invested in long-term instruments. Investing activities in 2019 included net purchases of $2.9 billion of investments, of which $2.8 billion was invested in short-term instruments and $0.1 billion was invested in long-term instruments. For additional information, see Note 13—Derivative and Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion. We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations, with another $200 million payment due upon final investment decision of the proposed Barossa development project. We also received proceeds of $359 million and $184 million for the sale of our Niobrara interests and Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, respectively. Proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion for the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields. Proceeds from assets sales in 2018 were $1.1 billion, including several non-core assets in the Lower 48, as well as the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the Clair Field in the U.K. For additional information on our dispositions, see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Activities We have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the U.S. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips Company’s ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. With $300 million of commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2020. We may consider issuing additional commercial paper in the future to supplement our cash position. In October 2020, Moody’s affirmed its rating of our senior long-term debt of “A3” with a “stable” outlook, and affirmed its rating of our short-term debt as “Prime-2.” In January 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-term debt as “A” with a “stable” outlook and affirmed its rating of our short-term debt as “F1+.” On January 25, 2021, S&P revised the industry risk assessment for the E&P industry to ‘Moderately High’ from 61 ‘Intermediate’ based on a view of increasing risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability. On February 11, 2021, S&P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt from “A” to “A-” with a “stable” outlook and downgraded its rating of our short-term debt from “A-1” to “A-2.” We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had direct bank letters of credit of $249 million and $277 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition, we assumed Concho’s publicly traded debt. On December 7, 2020, we launched an offer to exchange Concho’s publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips. The exchange offer settled on February 8, 2021. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of Concho’s notes subject to the exchange offer, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered and exchanged for new debt issued by ConocoPhillips. There were no impacts to ConocoPhillips’ credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange. For additional information, see Note 10—Debt and Note 25—Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc., in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Guarantor Summarized Financial Information We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and Burlington Resources LLC, with respect to publicly held debt securities. ConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent owned by ConocoPhillips. Burlington Resources LLC is 100 percent owned by ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips and/or ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Burlington Resources LLC, with respect to its publicly held debt securities. Similarly, ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition, ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and several. In March of 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to simplify the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. Based on our evaluation of our existing guarantee relationships, we qualify for the transition to alternative disclosures. We elected early voluntary compliance with the final amendments beginning in the third quarter of 2020. Accordingly, condensed consolidating information by guarantor and issuer of guaranteed securities will no longer be reported, and alternative disclosures of summarized financial information for the consolidated Obligor Group is presented. The following tables present summarized financial information for the Obligor Group, as defined below: ● The Obligor Group will reflect guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities consisting of ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and Burlington Resources LLC. ● Consolidating adjustments for elimination of investments in and transactions between the collective guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities are reflected in the balances of the summarized financial information. 62 ● Non-Obligated Subsidiaries are excluded from this presentation. Transactions and balances reflecting activity between the Obligors and Non-Obligated Subsidiaries are presented separately below: Summarized Income Statement Data Millions of Dollars 2020 Revenues and Other Income $ 8,375 Income (loss) before income taxes (2,999) Net income (loss) (2,701) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips (2,701) Summarized Balance Sheet Data Millions of Dollars December 31, 2020 Current assets $ 8,535 Amounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current 440 Noncurrent assets 37,180 Amounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent 7,730 Current liabilities 3,797 Amounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current 1,365 Noncurrent liabilities 18,627 Amounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent 3,972 Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15,369 million, an increase of $474 million from the balance at December 31, 2019. Maturities of debt (including payments for finance leases) due in 2021 of $601 million, excluding net unamortized premiums and discounts, will be paid from current cash balances and cash generated by operations. For more information on Debt, see Note 10—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing and sustainable dividend supplemented by additional returns of capital, including share repurchases. In 2020, we paid $1,831 million, $1.69 per share of common stock, in dividends. This is an increase over 2019 and 2018, when we paid $1.34 and $1.16 per share of common stock, respectively. In February 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, payable March 1, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 12, 2021. In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program, which has a current total program authorization of $25 billion of our common stock. Cost of share repurchases were $892 million, $3,500 million and $2,999 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Share repurchases since inception of our current program totaled 189 million shares at a cost of $10,517 million, as of December 31, 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchases upon entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Concho. We resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after the completion of our Concho acquisition. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. 63 Our dividend and share repurchase programs are subject to numerous considerations, including market conditions, management discretion and other factors. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors – Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.” In addition to the requirements above, we have contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services of approximately $8,123 million. We expect to fulfill $2,805 million of these obligations in 2021. These figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. Purchase obligations of $5,237 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. Purchase obligations of $2,290 million are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2020 2019 2018 Alaska $ 1,038 1,513 1,298 Lower 48 1,881 3,394 3,184 Canada 651 368 477 Europe, Middle East and North Africa 600 708 877 Asia Pacific 384 584 718 Other International 121 8 6 Corporate and Other 40 61 190 Capital Program $ 4,715 6,636 6,750 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 totaled $18.1 billion. The 2020 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily: ● Development and appraisal in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Permian, and Bakken. ● Appraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North Slope; development activities in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area. ● Development and exploration activities across assets in Norway. ● Appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays and optimization of oil sands development in Canada. ● Continued development activities in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. ● Exploration activities in Argentina. 2021 CAPITAL BUDGET In February 2021, we announced 2021 operating plan capital for the combined company of $5.5 billion. The plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current production and $0.4 billion for investment in major projects, primarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration appraisal activity. The operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion is expected to deliver production from the combined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021. This production guidance excludes Libya. For information on PUDs and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section in this report. 64 Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the low end of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. We accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 18—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: ● U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. ● U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. ● European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). ● U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. ● U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. ● U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S. 65 ● U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. ● U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. ● U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. ● European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the U.S. and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2020, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. 66 For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $393 million in 2020 and are expected to be about $435 million per year in 2021 and 2022. Capitalized environmental costs were $161 million in 2020 and are expected to be about $210 million per year in 2021 and 2022. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $180 million, compared with $171 million at December 31, 2019, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. 67 Climate Change Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: ● European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2020 was approximately $7 million before-tax. ● The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. The total cost of these regulations in 2020 was approximately $2 million. ● The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. ● The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. ● The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The U.S. government established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. ● Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2020 was approximately $29 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $3.5 million (net share before-tax). ● The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, setting out a process for achieving global emission reductions. The new administration has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced related commitments. In the U.S., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: ● Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. ● The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. 68 ● The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. ● The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). ● The GHG reductions required. ● The price and availability of offsets. ● The amount and allocation of allowances. ● Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. ● Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). ● Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Climate Change Litigation Beginning in 2017, governmental and other entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed. The amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented. ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits. Several Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA) against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages for contamination and erosion of the Louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations. ConocoPhillips entities are defendants in 22 of the lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. Because Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, there is uncertainty about these claims (both as to scope and damages) and any potential financial impact on the company. Company Response to Climate-Related Risks The company has responded by putting in place a Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence. We have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register. The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action Plan fall into four broad categories: ● GHG-related legislation and regulation. ● GHG emissions management. ● Physical climate-related impacts. ● Climate-related disclosure and reporting. Emissions are categorized into three different scopes. Gross operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions help us understand our climate transition risk. ● Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that we own or control. ● Scope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources that we neither own nor control. 69 We announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with the objective of implementing a coherent set of choices designed to facilitate the success of our existing exploration and production business through the energy transition. Given the uncertainties remaining about how the energy transition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust across a range of potential future outcomes. The strategy is comprised of four pillars: ● Targets: Our target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term ambition that sets the direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions intensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These performance targets are supported by lower-level internal business unit goals to enable the company to achieve the company-wide targets. We have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, with an ambition to achieve net-zero operated emissions by 2050. We have joined the World Bank Flaring Initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030. ● Technology choices: We expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader range of opportunities for emission reduction technology. ● Portfolio choices: Our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to include a GHG price in their project approval economics. Different GHG prices are used depending on the region or jurisdiction. Projects in jurisdictions with existing GHG pricing regimes incorporate the existing GHG price and forecast into their economics. Projects where no existing GHG pricing regime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our internally consistent World Energy Model. In this way, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making. The company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations. ● External engagement: Our external engagement aims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and gas sector with our approach to managing climate-related risk. We are a Founding Member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil 70 and gas reserves have been recognized. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2020, the remaining $2.4 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $1.9 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2021. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment. At year-end 2020, total suspended well costs were $682 million, compared with $1,020 million at year-end 2019. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2020, the net book value of productive PP&E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $33 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2020 was approximately $5.3 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.2 billion BOE at the end of 2019 and 2.5 billion BOE at the end of 2020. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2020 would have increased by an estimated $588 million. Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management’s assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating 72 costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 8—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 5—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. Estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. The carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 73 Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,200 million. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $110 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $80 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 17—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and Note 12—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets 74 will not be realized. In assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). See Note 18—Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. See Note 18—Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 75 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans, objectives of management for future operations, the anticipated benefits of the transaction between us and Concho, the anticipated impact of the transaction on the combined company’s business and future financial and operating results, the expected amount and the timing of synergies from the transaction are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “effort,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “goal,” “guidance,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions. We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following: ● The impact of public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics and any related company or government policies or actions. ● Global and regional changes in the demand, supply, prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas, including changes resulting from a public health crisis or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries and the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes. ● Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels. ● The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs, which may result in recognition of impairment charges on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments. ● Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. ● Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise. ● Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. ● Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating E&P facilities. ● Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal. ● Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. ● Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development, or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations. ● Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, 76 announced and future E&P and LNG development in a timely manner (if at all) or on budget. ● Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks, and information technology failures, constraints or disruptions. ● Changes in international monetary conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. ● Changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, NGLs and any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business. ● Substantial investment in and development use of, competing or alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. ● Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under existing and future environmental regulations and litigation. ● Significant operational or investment changes imposed by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce GHG emissions. ● Liability resulting from litigation, including the potential for litigation related to the transaction with Concho, or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. ● General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs pricing; regulation or taxation; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments. ● Volatility in the commodity futures markets. ● Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. ● Competition and consolidation in the oil and gas E&P industry. ● Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital, including as a result of illiquidity or uncertainty in domestic or international financial markets or investment sentiment. ● Our inability to execute, or delays in the completion, of any asset dispositions or acquisitions we elect to pursue. ● Potential failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, any necessary regulatory approvals for pending or future asset dispositions or acquisitions, or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or the operation of our remaining business. ● Potential disruption of our operations as a result of pending or future asset dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of management time and attention. ● Our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions that are pending or that we elect to undertake in the future in the manner and timeframe we currently anticipate, if at all. ● Our inability to liquidate the common stock issued to us by Cenovus Energy as part of our sale of certain assets in western Canada at prices we deem acceptable, or at all. ● The operation and financing of our joint ventures. ● The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us, including our ability to collect payments when due from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA. ● Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and capital expenditure reductions. ● The inadequacy of storage capacity for our products, and ensuing curtailments, whether voluntary or involuntary, required to mitigate this physical constraint. ● Our ability to successfully integrate Concho’s business. ● The risk that the expected benefits and cost reductions associated with the transaction with Concho may not be fully achieved in a timely manner, or at all. ● The risk that we will be unable to retain and hire key personnel. ● Unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to integration with Concho. ● Uncertainty as to the long-term value of our common stock. ● The diversion of management time on integration-related matters. ● The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any additional risks described in our other filings with the SEC. 77 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: ● Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. ● Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 78 Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. A hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our floating-rate debt. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data. Changes to prevailing interest rates would not impact our cashflows associated with fixed rate debt, unless we elect to repurchase or retire such debt prior to maturity.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $0.45 billion CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $1.35 billion CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, were a before-tax loss of $16 million and $28 million, 79 respectively. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2020 and December 2019 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $39 million and $115 million, respectively. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The gross notional and fair value of these positions at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional Fair Value* 2020 2019 2020 2019 Sell Canadian dollar, buy U.S. dollar CAD 450 1,350 (16) (28) Buy Canadian dollar, sell U.S. dollar CAD 80 13 2 - Sell British pound, buy euro GBP 8 - - - Buy British pound, sell euro GBP 3 4 - - *Denominated in USD.

Business Environment and Executive OverviewConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading E&P companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 14 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe and Asia; LNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $91 billion. Completed AcquisitionsOn January 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations across New Mexico and West Texas in an all-stock transaction for $13.1 billion. See Note 3.In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell Enterprises LLC’s (Shell) assets in the Delaware Basin in an all-cash transaction for $8.7 billion after customary adjustments. Assets acquired include approximately 225,000 net acres of producing properties located entirely in Texas. See Note 3. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the risks related to integration of the assets acquired. Overview After an unprecedented 2020, the energy landscape improved throughout 2021 with prices reaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year; however, we expect prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile. Our view is that a successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain highly disciplined in our investment decisions and continually monitor market fundamentals, including OPEC Plus updates regarding supply guidance and inventory levels. Although global oil demand improved through 2021, the global economic recovery remains uncertain and subject to various risk factors, including actions taken to stem the proliferation of COVID-19. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of Contents35 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KAs the macro energy environment continues to evolve, we are embracing what we believe sector leadership requires through what we call our triple mandate. We believe that ConocoPhillips will play an essential role in meeting energy transition pathway demand delivering superior and consistent returns on and of capital through the price cycles, and achieving our net zero ambition on operational emissions, while retaining the flexibility to successfully adapt as the future unfolds. Our triple mandate is supported by financial principles and capital allocation priorities that should allow us to deliver superior returns through the cycles. Our financial principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and delivering ESG excellence, all of which are in service to delivering competitive financial returns. Our 2021 acquisitions of Concho and the Shell Permian assets further reinforce our differential value proposition. In 2021, we successfully delivered on our priorities. Total company production was 1,567 MBOED yielding cash provided by operating activities of $17 billion. We invested $5.3 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately $6 billion through our ordinary dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, our ordinary dividend returned $2.4 billion which included an increase from 43 cents per share to 46 cents per share, effective in December. Share repurchases resumed in February and amounted to $3.6 billion inclusive of our paced monetization program related to the Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares owned. See Note 5. We also demonstrated our commitment to preserving our top-tier balance sheet with an announcement to reduce the company’s gross debt by $5 billion over five years through a combination of natural and accelerated maturities. As part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts, in December 2021, we announced two transactions in our Asia Pacific segment enhancing our diverse portfolio. This included notifying Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion, before customary adjustments, and the sale of our interests in Indonesia for approximately $1.4 billion before customary adjustments. In addition to those transactions, in January 2022, we entered into a divestiture agreement to sell our interest in noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment for $440 million. These transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2022. For more information on APLNG, see Note 4 and for more information on pending dispositions, see Note 3.We announced an increase in our disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023, with approximately $2 billion sourced from the Permian Basin. As of year-end 2021, we have generated $0.3 billion in disposition proceeds. The proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company’s priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders and reduction of gross debt. In December 2021, we announced the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework. This framework is structured to continue delivering a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through -cycle share repurchases. It includes the addition of a VROC tier. The VROC tier will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. We have set our expected 2022 total return of capital from all three tiers at approximately $8 billion. For more information on our three-tier return of capital framework, seeCapital Resources and Liquidity. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 36 In 2021, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to ESG leadership and excellence and the specific targets we set in October 2020 when we became the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate-risk strategy. Our commitment includes: ●Net-zero ambition for operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050 with active advocacy for a price on carbon to address end-use (scope 3) emissions; ●Targeting a reduction in gross operated and net equity operational GHG emissions intensity by 40 to 50 percent from 2016 levels by 2030; ●Zero routine flaring by 2030, with an ambition to get there by 2025; ●10 percent reduction target for methane emissions intensity by 2025 from a 2019 baseline, in addition to the 65 percent reduction we have made since 2015; ●Adding continuous methane detection devices to our operations, with an initial focus on the larger Lower 48 facilities; ●Dedicated low carbon technology organization responsible for identifying and prioritizing global emissions reduction initiatives and opportunities associated with the energy transition, CCUS and hydrogen; and ●ESG performance factoring into executive and employee compensation programs. To support this commitment, in December 2021, we announced that approximately $0.2 billion of our 2022 company-wide capital expenditures would be dedicated to energy transition efforts across the company’s global operations aimed at accelerating the reduction of the company’s scope 1 and 2 emissions and to pursue business opportunities that address end-use emissions and early-stage low-carbon technology opportunities that leverage the company’s adjacencies. Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. Production increased 440 MBOED or 39 percent in 2021, compared to 2020. Production excluding Libya for 2021 was 1,527 MBOED. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 Winter Storm Uri and the conversion of Concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased by 28 MBOED or 2 percent. This increase was primarily due to new production from the Lower 48 and other development programs across the portfolio, partially offset by normal field decline. Production from Libya averaged 40 MBOED in 2021. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of Contents37 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KKey Operating and Financial Summary Significant items during 2021 and recent announcements included the following:●Announced an increase to expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders to a total of $8 billion, with the incremental $1 billion to be distributed through share repurchases and VROC tiers; ●Acquired and integrated Concho, capturing over $1 billion of synergies and savings ahead of schedule; acquired Shell’s Permian assets on December 1, 2021; ●Exercised preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, expected to close in the first quarter of 2022; ●Generated $0.3 billion in disposition proceeds from noncore sales and entered into agreements to sell an additional $1.8 billion in assets, subject to customary closing adjustments; ●Delivered strong operational performance across the company’s asset base, resulting in full-year production of 1,527 MBOED, excluding Libya; ●Achieved first production from GMT2, Malikai Phase 2, SNP Phase 2; completed Tor II project and started production from a third Montney multi-well pad; ●Net cash provided by operating activities was $17 billion, exceeding capital expenditures and investments of $5.3 billion; ●Distributed $6.0 billion to shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividends and $3.6 billion of share repurchases, representing over 30 percent return of cash provided by operating activities to shareholders; ●Ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billion and short-term investments of $0.4 billion, totaling over $5.4 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments ; ●Initiated a paced monetization of the company’s CVE investment, generating $1.1 billion in proceeds through the sale of 117 million shares, with the funds applied to share repurchases; 91 million CVE shares remained outstanding at year -end 2021; and ●Advanced the company’s net-zero ambition by announcing an increase in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions-intensity reduction targets to 40 to 50 percent from a 2016 baseline on a net equity and gross operated basis by 2030, from the previous target of 35 to 45 percent on only a gross operated basis. Business EnvironmentBrent crude oil prices averaged $71 per barrel in 2021, compared with $42 per barrel in 2020. The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist in the future. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial principles that underpin our value proposition; balance sheet strength, peer leading distributions, disciplined investments and ESG excellence, all of which support strong financial returns. ●Balance sheet strength. A strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles. We strive to maintain our ‘A’ -rating, and we have committed to reducing gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years. This will reduce interest expense and provide resilience in periods of volatility. We ended the year with over $5 billion in cash, maintaining balance sheet strength even after completing the all-cash acquisition of Shell’s Permian assets. ●Peer leading distributions. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable dividend, share repurchases, and beginning in 2022, the addition of VROC. In 2021, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $2.4 billion and repurchased $3.6 billion of our common stock partially sourced from our paced monetization program related to the CVE common shares owned. Our combined dividends and repurchases represented over 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. Our first VROC of $0.20 cents per share was paid on January 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2022. Our VROC will be made at the Board of Director’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. SeeNote 5. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certainconsiderations.” Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 38 ●Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production. We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the price cycles. Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion . oExercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline. Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&A. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth’s sake. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders. oControl our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations. oOptimize our portfolio. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho and Shell’s Permian assets, significantly increasing our unconventional portfolio with many additional years of low cost of supply inventory. The addition of this highly complementary acreage in the Midland and Delaware basins created a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading unconventional positions in the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48. In our Asia Pacific segment, we notified Origin Energy of our intent to exercise our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG and announced the sale of our interests in Indonesia. See Note 3. We continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that don’t compete. As such, in conjunction with our Shell Permian acquisition announcement, we communicated an increase in our planned disposition target to $4 to $5 billion in proceeds by year-end 2023 as part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts. oAdd to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: ◾Acquire interest in existing or new fields. ◾Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. ◾Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields. As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of Contents39 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KReserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. Our reserve replacement was 377 percent in 2021, reflecting a net increase from purchases and sales as well as higher prices. Our organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net increase of 1,115 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was 189 percent in 2021. In the three years ended December 31, 2021, our reserve replacement was 155 percent. Our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2021, which excluded a net increase of 1,022 MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 88 percent. Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years. ●ESG Leadership. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operati onal integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business operations. In September 2021, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to ESG leadership and excellence and the specific targets that we set in October 2020 when we became the first U.S. based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate-risk strategy. Our comprehensive energy transition strategy is designed to sustainably meet global energy demand while delivering competitive returns on and of capital through the energy transition. Our strategy also recognizes the importance of reducing society’s end-use emissions to meet global climate goals. As an E&P company, active only in the upstream side of the business, we do not produce end-use products directly for consumers. We believe that if everyone addressed their scope 1 and 2 emissions, scope 3 would also be addressed. This is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating that scope 3 emissions be addressed through a well-designed economywide price on carbon. In addition, we are making early-stage investments in transition opportunities with the potential to generate competitive returns that will help address end-use emissions, including CCUS and Hydrogen. We are also engaging with our supply chain on their emissions targets. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: ●Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. Commodity price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, global pandemics and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas over the past three years: Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 40 Brent crude oil prices averaged $70.73 per barrel in 2021, an increase of 70 percent compared with $41.68 per barrel in 2020. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices increased 72 percent from $39.37 per barrel in 2020 to $67.92 per barrel in 2021. Following COVID-19 economic shutdowns in early 2020, global oil demand increased steadily through the year alongside the global economic recovery. OPEC Plus supply restraint, capital discipline by U.S. E&P’s and various unplanned supply disruptions in producing countries moderated supply growth, reducing excess global inventories and putting upward pressure on global oil prices. Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 85 percent from an average of $2.08 per MMBTU in 2020 to $3.85 per MMBTU in 2021. Extreme weather events in many parts of the world and several global LNG liquefaction outages depleted global natural gas inventories in early 2021, generating strong demand for U.S. LNG exports and supporting robust domestic demand. Our realized bitumen price increased 368 percent from an average of $8.02 per barrel in 2020 to $37.52 per barrel in 2021. The increase was largely driven by strength in WTI, reflective of increasing global demand and OPEC discipline. The WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly flat as record high production offsets incremental pipeline capacity. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through improvements in alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs and access to the U.S. Gulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts. Our worldwide annual average realized price increased 70 percent from $32.15per BOE in 2020 to $54.63per BOE in 2021 primarily due to higher realized oil, natural gas and bitumen prices. North America’s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the U.S. Although providing significant short - and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Table of Contents41 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-K●Impairments. We participate in a capital -intensive industry. At times, our PP&E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7.●Effective tax rate. Our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations. ●Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity. Outlook Production and Capital 2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion. The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company’s scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions. Production guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest. First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED. Operating SegmentsWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International. Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues. Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production. Results of Operations Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 42 Results of Operations This section of the Form 10-K discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. For discussion of year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in Part II, Item 7 of our 2020 10-K. Consolidated Results A summary of the company’s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 202120202019Alaska $ 1,386 (719)1,520 Lower 48 4,932 (1,122)436 Canada 458 (326)279 Europe, Middle East and North Africa 1,167 448 3,170 Asia Pacific 453 962 1,483 Other International (107)(64)263 Corporate and Other (210)(1,880)38 Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 8,079 (2,701)7,189 Net Income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips increased $10.8 billion in 2021. 2021 earnings were positively impacted by: ●Higher realized commodity prices. ●Higher sales volumes primarily due to our Concho acquisition and absence of production curtailments. See Note 3. ●A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020. ●Lower exploration expenses due to: oAbsence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset. oLower dry hole expenses. oAbsence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska. oAbsence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans. ●Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices. ●Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments. ●An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3.●Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7. These increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by: ●Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes. ●Higher DD&A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021. ●Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020. ●Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.

Income Statement Analysis Unless otherwise indicated, all results in Income Statement Analysis are before-tax. Sales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment . Gain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 Australia-West divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment. The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment. Other income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5.Purchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes. Production and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. Exploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia. 2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska. Impairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021. For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13. Taxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes. Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.

At December 31, 2021, our operations were producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. Total production, including Libya, of 1,567 MBOED increased 440 MBOED or 39 percent in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to: ●Higher volumes in Lower 48 due to our Concho acquisition . ●New wells online in Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Malaysia and Alaska. ●Absence of production curtailments, primarily in our North American assets. ●Higher production in Libya due to the absence of a forced shutdown of the Es Sider export terminal and other eastern export terminals. ●Improved well performance in Norway, Canada, Alaska and China. The increase in production during 2021 was partly offset by: ●Normal field decline. ●Absence of production from Australia -West due to our second quarter 2020 disposition. Production excluding Libya for 2021 was 1,527 MBOED. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 Winter Storm Uri and the conversion of Concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased by 28 MBOED or 2 percent. This increase was primarily due to new production from the Lower 48 and other development programs across the portfolio, partially offset by normal field decline. Production from Libya averaged 40 MBOED in 2021.

Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 52 Capital Resources and Liquidity Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,996 4,802 11,104 Cash and cash equivalents 5,028 2,991 5,088 Short-term investments 446 3,609 3,028 Short-term debt 1,200 619 105 Total debt 19,934 15,369 14,895 Total equity 45,406 29,849 35,050 Percent of total debt to capital* 31 % 34 30 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt 4 % 7 5 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2021, the primary uses of our available cash were $8.7 billion for the acquisition of Shell Permian; $5.3 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $3.6 billion to repurchase our common stock; $2.4 billion to pay dividends; and $1.2 billion for hedging, transaction and restructuring costs. In 2021, cash and cash equivalents increased by $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion. At December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.0 billion, short-term investments of $0.4 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $6.0 billion, totaling approximately $11.5 billion of liquidity. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments. Significant Changes in Capital Operating Activities In 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $17 billion, compared with $4.8 billion for 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes, mostly resulting from our acquisition of Concho. The increase was partly offset by the $0.8 billion in settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from Concho, and approximately $0.4 billion of transaction and restructuring costs. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged 1,567 MBOED in 2021. Full-year production excluding Libya averaged 1,527 MBOED. Adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, impacts from 2020 curtailments, 2021 Winter Storm Uri and the conversion of Concho two-stream contracted volumes to a three-stream basis, production increased 28 MBOED or 2 percent. First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of Contents53 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-Kand the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost -effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production. For information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves,see the reserve table disclosures contained in “Supplementary Data – Oil and Gas Operations.” See “Item 1A—Risk Factors – Unless wesuccessfully develop our resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to ourbusiness.”As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities. Investing Activities In 2021, we invested $5.3 billion in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures invested in 2020 and 2019 were $4.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section. In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell’s assets in the Delaware Basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments. We funded this transaction with cash on hand. We completed our acquisition of Concho on January 15, 2021. The assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash. The net impact of these items is recognized within “Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired” on our consolidated sta tement of cash flows. See Note 3.In 2021, we announced a disposition target of $4 to $5 billion in disposition proceeds by year-end 2023. Only proceeds from transactions announced or initiated in the third quarter of 2021 or later will be counted toward this target. The proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company’s priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders and reduction of gross debt. To date, we have achieved $0.3 billion from the sale of noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment. Total proceeds from asset dispositions in 2021 were $1.7 billion. Including the $250 million mentioned above, we also received cash proceeds of $1.14 billion from sales of our investment in CVE common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. See Note 3. In May 2021, we announced and began a paced monetization of our investment in CVE with the plan to direct proceeds toward our existing share repurchase program. We expect to fully dispose of our CVE common shares by early 2022, however, the sales pace will be guided by market conditions, and we retain discretion to adjust accordingly. See Note 5.Proceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion. We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations. We also received proceeds of $359 million and $184 million from the sale of our Niobrara interests and Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, respectively. Proceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion for the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields. See Note 3.We invest in short -term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 54 price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. See Note 12. Financing Activities We have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the U.S. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. The revolving credit facility supports ConocoPhillips Company’s ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2021. On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition, we assumed Concho’s publicly traded debt and in December 2020, we launched an offer to exchange Concho’s publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips. There were no impacts to ConocoPhillips’ credit ratings as a result of the debt exchange. In June 2021, we reaffirmed our commitment to preserving our ‘A’ -rated balance sheet by restating our intent to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years, driving a more resilient and efficient capital structure. See Note 9 and Note 3. On January 25, 2021, S&P revised the industry risk assessment for the E&P industry to ‘Moderately High’ from ‘Intermediate’ based on a view of increasing risks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker profitability. On February 11, 2021, S&P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt from “A” to “A -” with a “stable” outlook and affirmed this rating in November 2021. In October 2021, Moody’s affirmed its “A3” rating of our long-term debt and revised its outlook from “stable” to “positive”. In December 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-term debt as “A” with a “stable” outlook. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had direct bank letters of credit of $337 million and $249 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of Contents55 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KCapital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2021, was $19.9 billion, an increase of $4.6 billion from the balance at December 31, 2020, driven by debt acquired as part of the Concho acquisition. Maturities of debt (including payments for finance leases) due in 2022 of $1.1 billion will be paid from current cash balances and cash generated by operations. See Note 9.In December 2021, we announced our expected 2022 return of capital program and the initiation of a three-tier return of capital framework. The framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. It includes the addition of a discretionary VROC tier. The VROC will provide a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. We have set our expected 2022 total capital returns at approximately $8 billion, consisting of distributions from each of the three tiers. Consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, in 2021, we paid $2.4 billion, $1.75 per share of common stock, in ordinary dividends. This was an increase over 2020 and 2019, when we paid $1.69 and $1.34 per share of common stock, respectively. On February 3, 2022, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable March 1, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2022. On January 14, 2022, we paid the first VROC payment of $0.20 per share to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2022. On February 3, 2022, we announced a VROC of $0.30 per share, payable on April 14, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2022. The ordinary dividend and VROC are subject to numerous considerations and will be determined and approved each quarter by the Board of Directors. We expect to announce the VROC when we announce our ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payouts will be staggered from the ordinary dividend, resulting in up to eight cash distributions throughout the year. In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program with Board of Director’s authorization of $25 billion of our common stock. Share repurchases were $3.6 billion, $0.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 247 million shares and $14 billion. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. For more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see “Item 1A—RiskFactors – Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.”In addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $11.8 billion. We expect to fulfill $6 billion of these obligations in 2022. These figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. Purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third -party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. Purchase obligations of $5.3 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

We accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 11for information on contingencies. Legal and Tax Matters We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if an adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 17.Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: ●U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. ●U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. ●European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). ●U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. ●U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. ●U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S. ●U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. ●U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. ●U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. ●European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of Contents59 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KThese laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits, and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the U.S. and Canada. An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2021, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 60 For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $632 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $642 million and $700 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $184 million in 2021 and are expected to be about $218 million and $316 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA , and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA, or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2021, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $187 million, compared with $180 million at December 31, 2020, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. See Item 1A—Risk Factors – We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations and Note 11 for information on environmental litigatio n. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of Contents61 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KClimate Change Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: ●European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2021 was approximately $19 million (net share before-tax ). ●U.K. Emissions Trading Scheme, the program with which the U.K. has replaced the ETS. Our cost of compliance with the U.K. ETS in 2021 was approximately $2.8 million (net share before -tax). ●The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. The total cost of these regulations in 2021 was approximately $1 million (net share before-tax) . ●The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act. ●The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. ●The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. ●The U.S. government has announced on September 17, 2021 the Global Methane Pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030. ●Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2021 were fees of approximately $35 million (net share before -tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $5.7 million (net share before-tax). ●The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, setting out a process for achieving global emission reductions. The new administration has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced related commitments. Accordingly, the U.S. administration set a new target on April 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030. In the U.S., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 62 Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: ●Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted. ●The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation. ●The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation. ●The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax). ●The GHG reductions required. ●The price and availability of offsets. ●The amount and allocation of allowances. ●Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. ●Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). ●Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. See Item 1A—Risk Factors – Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products and Note 11 for information on climate change litigation. Company Response to Climate -Related Risks The company has responded by putting in place a Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard covering the assessment and registration of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence. We have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register. The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action Plan fall into four broad categories: ●GHG-related legislation and regulation. ●GHG emissions management. ●Physical climate-related impacts. ●Climate-related disclosure and reporting. Emissions are categorized into three different scopes. Gross operated and net equity Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions help us understand our climate transition risk. ●Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that we control or in which we have ownership interest. ●Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume. ●Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from sources that we neither own nor control. Capital Resources and Liquidity Table of Contents63 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KWe announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with the objective of implementing a coherent set of choices designed to facilitate the success of our existing exploration and production business through the energy transition. Given the uncertainties remaining about how the energy transition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust across a range of potential future outcomes. The strategy is comprised of four pillars: ●Targets : Our target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term ambition that sets the direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions intensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These performance targets are supported by lower-level internal business unit goals to enable the company to achieve the company-wide targets. In September 2021, we increased our interim operational target and have set it to reduce our gross operated and net equity (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity by 40 to 50 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, an improvement from the previously announced target of 35 to 45 percent on only a gross operated basis, with an ambition to achieve net-zero operated emissions by 2050. We have joined the World Bank Flaring Initiative to work towards zero routine flaring of associated gas by 2030, with an ambition to meet that goal by 2025. ●Technology choices: We expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader range of opportunities for emission reduction technology. ●Portfolio choices: Our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to include a GHG price in their project approval economics. Different GHG prices are used depending on the region or jurisdiction. Projects in jurisdictions with existing GHG pricing regimes incorporate the existing GHG price and forecast into their economics. Projects where no existing GHG pricing regime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our internally consistent World Energy Model. In this way, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making. The company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations . This is in contrast to changes to the cost of existing GHG emission regulations which can impact our reserves calculations. ●External engagement: Our external engagement aims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and gas sector with our approach to managing climate-related risk. We are a Founding Member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 64 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized. Property Acquisition Costs At year-end 2021, we held $9.3 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, and to a lesser extent, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. This amount increased by $6.9 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions in the Permian Basin where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. Outside of the Permian Basin, the remaining $2.0 billion is concentrated in 9 major development areas. Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development. Table of Contents65 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. At year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6.Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. See Oil and Gas supplemental disclosures for additional information. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Our proved reserves include estimat ed quantities related to PSCs, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline. The estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2021, the net book value of productive PP&E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2021 was approximately $7.0 billion. The estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion BOE at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2021. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2021 would have increased by an estimated $774 million. Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 66 Business Combination—Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties For recent transactions, management applied the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 – “Business Combinations” and allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimating the fair values involved making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. Management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates. Significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market -based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves. The assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See Note 3.Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management’s assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 4. Table of Contents67 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. Estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. The carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 8.Projected Benefit Obligations The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1.0 billion. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 16. Table of ContentsConocoPhillips 2021 10-K 68 Contingencies A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and Note 11.Income Taxes We are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevai ling oil and gas prices). See Note 17.We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. See Note 17 regarding discussion of critical accounting estimates on deferred tax valuation allowances.

Table of Contents71 ConocoPhillips 2021 10-KItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks. Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives: ●Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices. ●Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. A hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our floating-rate debt. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data. Changes to prevailing interest rates would not impact our cash flows associated with fixed rate debt, unless we elect to repurchase or retire such debt prior to maturity.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to buy $1.9 billion AUD at $0.715 AUD against the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $0.45 billion CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were a before-tax gain of $21 million and before -tax loss of $16 million, respectively. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2021 and December 2020 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $134 million and $39 million, respectively. The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
