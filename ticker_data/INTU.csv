896878,INTU,INTUIT INC.,2011,"Item 7.The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:(Dollars in millions)July 31,2011 July 31,2010 $Change %ChangeCash, cash equivalents and investments$1,421 $1,622 $(201) (12)%Long-term investments63 91 (28) (31)%Current portion of long-term debt500 — 500 N/ALong-term debt499 998 (499) (50)%Working capital449 1,074 (625) (58)%Ratio of current assets to current liabilities1.2 : 1 1.9 : 1 Auction Rate SecuritiesAt July 31, 2011, we held a total of $59 million in municipal auction rate securities which we classified as long-term investments on our balance sheet based on the maturities of the underlying securities. All of these securities are rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and the majority of the securities are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating 46Tables of Contentstheir fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2011 will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.Statements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal(Dollars in millions)2011 2010 2009Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$1,013 $998 $812Investing activities497 (997) (432)Financing activities(1,006) (467) (110)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash4 1 (4)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$508 $(465) $266Operating ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2011 we generated $1.0 billion in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $634 million and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $241 million and share-based compensation expense of $153 million. Amortization expense was lower in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 due to the completion of the amortization for certain Intuit Financial Services intangible assets that we acquired in fiscal 2007. Share-based compensation increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 because the market price of our common stock was higher at the time of our broad-based July 2010 grants of stock options and restricted stock units compared with the prior fiscal year.During fiscal 2010 we generated $998 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $539 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $256 million and share-based compensation of $135 million. Amortization expense was lower in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 due to the completion of the amortization for certain Intuit Financial Services intangible assets that we acquired in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2009 we generated $812 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $275 million and share-based compensation of $133 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due in part to depreciation for a new data center that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Share-based compensation increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options.Investing ActivitiesWe generated $497 million in cash from investing activities during fiscal 2011. We received $697 million in cash from net sales of investments and we used $213 million in cash for capital expenditures.We used $997 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2010. We received a net $122 million in cash from the sale of our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We used $895 million in cash for net purchases of investments, $218 million in cash for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Mint and Medfusion), and $130 million in cash for capital expenditures.We used $432 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2009, including $161 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily PayCycle), $182 million for capital expenditures, and $67 million for net purchases of investments. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 included investments in a new data center which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009.Financing ActivitiesWe used $1.0 billion in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2011, including $1.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the receipt of $338 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.47Tables of ContentsWe used $467 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2010, including $900 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the receipt of $440 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.We used $110 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2009, including $300 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by receipt of $198 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.Stock Repurchase ProgramsOur Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2011 we repurchased 28.2 million shares of our common stock under these programs for $1.4 billion; during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 28.7 million shares for $900 million; and during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 10.9 million shares for $300 million. At July 31, 2011, authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to $640 million remained available under the existing program for stock repurchases through August 16, 2013. On August 18, 2011 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period ending on August 15, 2014.Cash DividendsIn August 2011 our Board of Directors declared the first cash dividend in our history of $0.15 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2011. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Business CombinationsWe completed the business combinations and acquisitions described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2011. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations.On May 21, 2010 we acquired privately held Medfusion, Inc. for total consideration of approximately $89 million. The total consideration included approximately $10 million for the fair value of cash retention bonuses that is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Medfusion is a provider of online patient-to-provider communication solutions and became part of our Other Businesses segment.On November 2, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Mint Software Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million. The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment.On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment.Commitments for Senior Unsecured NotesOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (together, the Notes). Because their contractual maturities are now within one year, we transferred the March 2012 notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities during fiscal 2011. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2011, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $199 million.We monitor the credit markets as part of our ongoing cash management activities. We currently intend to either pay off the March 2012 notes when they become due using operating cash or refinance those notes if the credit markets are favorable at that time.48Tables of ContentsUnsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2011. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.4 billion at July 31, 2011. Of this amount, less than 10% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future.Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account these operating and strategic cash needs.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt July 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.49Tables of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions)1 year years years 5 years TotalAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan$50 $— $— $— $50Senior unsecured notes500 — — 500 1,000Interest and fees due on long-term obligations56 57 57 29 199License fee payable (1)10 20 20 30 80Operating leases52 91 86 215 444Purchase obligations (2)78 92 80 37 287Total contractual obligations (3)$746 $260 $243 $811 $2,060_____________________(1)In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

The largest of these commitments relates to future outsourced electronic payment fulfillment and bill management services for our Financial Services segment.(3)Other long-term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2011 included non-current income tax liabilities of $42 million which related primarily to unrecognized tax benefits. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment PortfolioThere has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during the last three fiscal years. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of the cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2011 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2011, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money 50Tables of Contentsmarket accounts was 0.04% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 0.76%.

Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2011, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $2 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2011, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $10 million.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.Impact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2011 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.51Tables of ContentsITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm53 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201155 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2011 and 201056 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201157 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201158 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements602.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:Schedule PageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 93 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required.52Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 14, 2011 53Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our report dated September 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP San Jose, California September 14, 2011 54Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. Our flagship products and services, including QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, simplify small business management including payment and payroll processing, tax preparation and filing, and personal finance. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Our Financial Services business provides online banking solutions and services to banks and credit unions. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments.In fiscal 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc. and in fiscal 2010 we acquired Mint Software Inc. and Medfusion, Inc. Accordingly, we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7. As discussed in Note 8, in January 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sale to reflect this business as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.SeasonalityOur QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels.Use of EstimatesWe make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units, share-based compensation and illiquid municipal auction rate securities. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, technical support plans, financial supplies, implementation services, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Determining whether and when these criteria have been satisfied involves exercising judgment and using estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize.In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services.60Tables of ContentsWe account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products, financial supplies such as printed check stock, and merchant services hardware such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones, when legal title transfers. This is generally when our customers download products from the Web, when we ship the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell some of our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken desktop software products on consignment to certain retailers. We recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For software products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. We record product revenue net of our sales tax obligations.We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.Service and Other RevenueOur service revenue consists primarily of hosted services such as QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Online, payroll services, electronic merchant payment processing services, electronic tax filing services, and outsourced online banking services for financial institutions. Our service revenue also includes QuickBooks technical support plans in our Financial Management Solutions segment and implementation fees in our Financial Services segment and our Intuit Health business.We recognize revenue from hosted services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest that we earn on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees.We offer several QuickBooks technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. We recognize revenue for upfront fees for implementation services in our Financial Services segment and our Intuit Health business ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party service providers. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user sales are reported to us by these partners.Multiple Element ArrangementsWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, hosted services, technical support, and hardware. Multiple Element Arrangements with Software and Software-Related ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, such as QuickBooks desktop software and paid technical support plans, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.61Tables of ContentsWe recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services.Multiple Element Arrangements with Software and Non-Software ElementsIn October 2009 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards applicable to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that are outside the scope of industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. This new guidance amended the criteria for allocating consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that contained both software and non-software elements by establishing a selling price hierarchy. The guidance also eliminated the use of the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis on August 1, 2010, and therefore applied it to relevant revenue arrangements originating or materially modified on or after that date. Our adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on the timing and pattern of revenue recognition when applied to multiple element arrangements because our multiple element offerings are predominantly software and software-related and VSOE exists for most of these offerings.For multiple element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements such as hosted services or credit card readers for mobile phones, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence of fair value (VSOE) of fair value if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. Once we have allocated the total price among the various elements, we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met for each element.VSOE generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and we are normally able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements; however, in certain limited instances VSOE cannot be established. This may be because we infrequently sell each element separately, do not price products or services within a narrow range, or have a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish selling price for each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. ESP is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, type of customer, geographies, stage of product lifecycle, internal costs, and gross margin objectives. Significant pricing practices that we take into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable, and our price lists. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by management, taking into consideration our overall go-to-market strategy. Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service and free technical support costs in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products, since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.62Tables of ContentsSoftware Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations.Internal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to computer software obtained or developed for internal use. Software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Software developed for internal use has generally been used to deliver hosted services to our customers. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years.AdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $177 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011, $153 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 and $142 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.LeasesWe review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations.63Tables of ContentsWe review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.Computation of Net Income Per ShareWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.64Tables of ContentsThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities that we carry at fair value. Long-term investments consist primarily of municipal auction rate securities that we carry at fair value. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, we estimate the fair values of these municipal auction rate securities based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 2 for more information. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities.Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit 65Tables of Contentslosses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance.Funds Held for Customers and Customer Fund DepositsFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade available-for-sale debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination) in a manner that is generally similar to the previous purchase method of accounting.Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the 66Tables of Contentsbusiness, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, ""Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,"" for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 or 2009.Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, ""Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,"" for a discussion of the acquired intangible asset impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. We recorded no impairment charges for acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 or 2009.Share-Based Compensation PlansWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. Prior to July 2011, we valued these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. Prior to July 2011, we estimated the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. In July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future. Since RSU holders are not entitled to dividends, beginning in July 2011 we began reducing the market price of our stock on the date of grant, which is used in the intrinsic value method, by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award.See Note 12 for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.67Tables of ContentsWe are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2011 or 2010.We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2011-04, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”On May 12, 2011 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs"" (ASU 2011-04). This update amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure.” ASU 2011-04 clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. ASU 2011-04 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning February 1, 2012. The new guidance is to be adopted prospectively and early adoption is not permitted. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.ASU 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income”On June 16, 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2011-05). This update amends ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income” to provide that total comprehensive income will be reported in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements of financial performance. Presentation of total comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity or the footnotes will no longer be allowed. The calculation of net income and basic and diluted net income per share will not be affected. ASU 2011-005 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2011, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2012. Retrospective adoption is required and early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.2. Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three 68Tables of Contentslevels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.

Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets using quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of debt. See Note 10. We measure the fair value of our senior notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. Financial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are no longer liquid. These securities are included in long-term investments on our balance sheets at July 31, 2011 and 2010 based on the maturities of the underlying securities at those dates. There were no significant transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.The following table presents a reconciliation of activity for our Level 3 assets for the periods shown.

All of the municipal auction rate securities we held were rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and the majority of the securities were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. In November 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, which gave us the option to sell UBS all of the municipal auction rate securities that we held through them at par value. In June 2010 UBS settled the remaining balance of $110 million in municipal auction rate securities subject to the offer at par. We accounted for the put option at its cost of zero on the date that we entered into the agreement because we considered the value of the securities subject to the put option to be substantially equal to their par values at that date. We classified the remaining balances of municipal auction rate securities that we held at July 31, 2011 and 2010 as long-term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities at those dates.We estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. Key inputs to our discounted cash flow model included the projected future interest rates; the likely timing of principal repayments; the probability of full repayment considering guarantees by the U.S. Department of Education of the underlying student loans or insurance by other third parties; publicly available pricing data for recently issued student loan backed securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities.70Tables of ContentsThe following table presents information about significant inputs to our discounted cash flow model at the dates shown: Inputs to Model at July 31,2011 July 31,2010 July 31,2009Range of average projected future yield rates1.37% - 2.46% 1.48% - 2.65% 0.63% - 3.78%Range of overall discount rates used in model (like-kind security yield rate plus illiquidity factor)1.33% - 1.58% 1.52% - 1.77% 1.61% - 1.86%Like-kind security yield rate0.08% 0.27% 0.36%Range of illiquidity factors125 - 150 bps 125 - 150 bps 125 - 150 bpsExpected holding period in years7 7 7Using our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately equal to their par values. As a result, we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in conjunction with our annual planning and budgeting process. See Note 1 for a complete description of our methodology for this test. In step one of the test we compared the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying values. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units. We determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except Intuit Health exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. The estimated fair value of our Intuit Health reporting unit, which is part of our Other Businesses segment, fell below its carrying value of $75 million. As a result, we completed step two of the test by allocating the fair value of that reporting unit calculated in step one of the test to all of the assets and liabilities of the unit, as if we had just acquired it in a business combination. In comparing the residual goodwill resulting from this calculation to the carrying value of the goodwill, we determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets for our Intuit Health reporting unit were impaired. All of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with our Intuit Health reporting unit were derived from our fiscal 2010 acquisition of Medfusion, Inc. Circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of the Intuit Health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality, timely offerings and marketing them effectively. We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $30 million for our Intuit Health reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $24 million and an acquired intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $6 million.71Tables of Contents3.

Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2011 and July 31, 2010 were not significant.We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2011 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Unrealized losses at July 31, 2011 were not significant and are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities.72Tables of ContentsThe following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.

As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Software Development Costs,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $99 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; $56 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; and $52 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $35 million, $28 million and $17 million. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years.73Tables of Contents5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsGoodwillChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 and July 31, 2010 were as shown in the following table.

Comprehensive Net IncomeWe add components of other comprehensive income, such as changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, to our net income to arrive at comprehensive net income. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, other comprehensive income was not significant. The balances in accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheets at July 31, 2011 and July 31, 2010 consisted primarily of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and were also not significant.7. Business CombinationsWe completed the business combinations and acquisitions described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2011. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management.Fiscal 2010 Business CombinationsMedfusion, Inc.On May 21, 2010 we acquired privately held Medfusion, Inc. for total consideration of approximately $89 million. The total consideration included approximately $10 million for the fair value of cash retention bonuses that is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Medfusion is a provider of online patient-to-provider communication solutions and became part of our Other Businesses segment. We acquired Medfusion to expand our online healthcare offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy.Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $8 million of the consideration to net tangible liabilities and approximately $23 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $62 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of six years. See Note 2, ""Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,"" for a discussion of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge that we recorded for our Intuit Health reporting unit during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011.75Tables of ContentsMint Software Inc.On November 2, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Mint Software Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million. The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment. We acquired Mint to expand our online personal finance offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy.Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $1 million of the consideration to net tangible assets and approximately $43 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $102 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years.Fiscal 2009 AcquisitionsPayCycle, Inc.On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. We acquired PayCycle to expand our online payroll offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy.Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $5 million of the purchase price to net tangible assets and approximately $42 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $122 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years.8. Discontinued OperationsOn January 15, 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES) business for approximately $128 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $35 million, which included $72 million for goodwill and $23 million for income taxes. The decision to sell IRES was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and services. IRES was part of our Other Businesses segment. We accounted for IRES as a discontinued operation and have therefore segregated the operating results of IRES from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net revenue from IRES was $33 million and net income excluding the net gain on disposal was less than $1 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. Net revenue was $74 million and net income was less than $1 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. Because IRES operating cash flows were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. We have presented the effect of the net gain on disposal of IRES in net income from discontinued operations on our statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010.9. Current LiabilitiesCurrent Portion of Long-Term DebtThe current portion of long-term debt consists of $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012, less the unamortized discount. Because their contractual maturities are now within one year, we transferred these notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities during fiscal 2011. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Obligations and Commitments - Long-Term Debt,"" for more information.76Tables of ContentsUnsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2011.

Long-Term Obligations and CommitmentsLong-Term DebtOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (together, the Notes), for a total principal amount of $1 billion. Because their contractual maturities are now within one year, we transferred the March 2012 notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities during fiscal 2011. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The Notes include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.

The total license fee payable in the table above includes imputed interest through the dates indicated.Operating Lease Commitments and Unconditional Purchase ObligationsWe lease office facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The leases for our corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California expire in 2024 and 2026, with options to extend the lease terms for an additional ten years at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. At July 31, 2011, the largest of these commitments related to future outsourced electronic payment fulfillment and bill management services for our Financial Services segment.78Tables of ContentsAnnual minimum commitments under operating leases and purchase obligations at July 31, 2011 were as shown in the table below.(In millions)OperatingLeaseCommitments Purchase ObligationsFiscal year ending July 31, 2012$52 $78201346 48201445 44201543 40201643 40Thereafter215 37Total operating lease commitments$444 $287Rent expense totaled $48 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; and $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.

The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2011 that was retroactive to January 1, 2010. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $9 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2010 and the first quarter of fiscal 2011 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011.During the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 we recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $20 million that were related to foreign tax credits associated with the distribution of profits from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and our plans to indefinitely reinvest substantially all remaining non-U.S. earnings in support of our international expansion plans. This tax benefit is shown in the table above on the effects of non-U.S. operations line.In January 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009. As a result of this agreement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $18 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.In October 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $7 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal year 2008 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.80Tables of ContentsSignificant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2011 2010Deferred tax assets: Accruals and reserves not currently deductible$28 $30Deferred rent9 10Accrued and deferred compensation33 18Loss and tax credit carryforwards39 63Property and equipment11 8Share-based compensation88 89Other, net1 4Total deferred tax assets209 222Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets51 55Other, net1 1Total deferred tax liabilities52 56Total net deferred tax assets157 166Valuation allowance(8) (8)Total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance$149 $158We have provided a valuation allowance related to the benefits of certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 and 2010 were not significant. We provide U.S. federal income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. To the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may, subject to certain limitations, be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. At July 31, 2011, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes had not been provided was approximately $30 million. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $8 million. The components of total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, as shown on our balance sheets were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2011 2010Current deferred income taxes$94 $117Long-term deferred income taxes55 41Total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance$149 $158At July 31, 2011, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2021. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2011, we had excess federal foreign tax credits of approximately $15 million, of which $2 million can be carried back and $13 million can be carried forward. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. The foreign source income limitation may result in the expiration of foreign tax credits before utilization.At July 31, 2011, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $168 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $9 million and a valuation allowance of $8 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in 81Tables of Contentsfiscal 2014. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation.

Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $35 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $35 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal 2006 and for years prior to fiscal 2005. For California tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2005.We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2011 and July 31, 2010 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were also not significant.12. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramsIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 28.2 million shares of our common stock for $1.4 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; 28.7 million shares for $900 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; and 10.9 million shares for $300 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. At July 31, 2011, authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to $640 million remained available under the existing program for stock repurchases through August 16, 2013. On August 18, 2011 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period ending on August 15, 2014.Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.Dividends on Common StockIn August 2011 our Board of Directors declared the first cash dividend in our history of $0.15 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2011. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.82Tables of ContentsDescription of 2005 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 19, 2011 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 19, 2015. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 96,000,000 shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. At July 31, 2011, there were approximately 30.7 million shares available for grant under this plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.Description of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 16,800,000 shares under the ESPP, which expires on July 27, 2015. During fiscal 2011, offering periods under the ESPP were three months in duration and shares were purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day or the last day of the offering period. Effective September 16, 2011, offering periods under the ESPP will be six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares will be purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 840,654 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; 1,120,030 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; and 1,368,005 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. At July 31, 2011, there were 1,780,671 shares available for issuance under this plan.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded for the periods shown.

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. Prior to July 2011, we valued these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. Prior to July 2011, we estimated the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. As discussed below under ""Dividends,"" in July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future. Since RSU holders are not entitled to dividends, starting in July 2011 we began reducing the market price of our stock on the date of grant, which is used in the intrinsic value method, by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award.Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. In the past, we never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we did not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. In July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future and as a result we began using an expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. See ""Dividends on Common Stock"" above for more information. Forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.84Tables of ContentsWe used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2011 2010 2009Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range)27% - 30% 24% - 30% 28% - 44%Weighted average expected volatility28% 28% 31%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.87% - 1.91% 1.37% - 2.82% 1.13% - 3.08%Expected dividend yield (1)0% - 1.20% 0% 0% Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range)27% - 33% 22% - 29% 35% - 53%Weighted average expected volatility29% 26% 42%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.05% - 0.16% 0.04% - 0.16% 0.04% - 0.84%Expected dividend yield0% 0% 0%__________________(1)Expected dividend yield assumption was zero for fiscal 2011 option grants prior to July 2011. In July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future and as a result we began using an expected dividend yield assumption in our valuation models.

Benefit PlansExecutive Deferred Compensation PlanIn December 2004 we initially adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. We adopted this plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The 88Tables of Contentsbenefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. Employer contributions to the plan were not significant for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $50 million at July 31, 2011 and $43 million at July 31, 2010. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar performing assets. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets.401(k) PlanIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 20% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 150% of the first $1,000 and up to 75% of the next six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching contributions were $34 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; $32 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; and $35 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.14. LitigationIntuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.15.

All of these securities are rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating their fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2012 will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.Statements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010.

This included net income from continuing operations of $767 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $242 million and share-based compensation expense of $169 million.

This included net income from continuing operations of $652 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $241 million and share-based compensation of $153 million.

Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2012 we repurchased 16.9 million shares of our common stock under these programs for $900 million; during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.4 billion; and during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 28.7 million shares for $900 million. At July 31, 2012, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.7 billion for stock repurchases through August 15, 2014. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Dividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2012 we declared and paid cash dividends that totaled $0.60 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $178 million. In August 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2012 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 10, 2012. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Business CombinationsWe completed the business combinations described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2012.

The total of $24 million is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment.Commitments for Senior Unsecured NotesOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes). We repaid the 2012 Notes when they became due using cash from operations. The 2017 Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2012, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the 2017 Notes was $144 million.Unsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 17, 2017. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either JP Morgan's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The agreement includes customer affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2012. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $744 million at July 31, 2012. Of this amount, less than 20% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future.Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account these operating and strategic cash needs.51Tables of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt July 31, 2012, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2012: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions)1 year years years 5 years TotalAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan$56 $— $— $— $56Senior unsecured notes— — 500 — 500Interest and fees due on long-term obligations29 59 59 — 147License fee payable (1)10 20 20 20 70Operating leases57 109 87 174 427Purchase obligations (2)89 130 78 — 297Total contractual obligations (3)$241 $318 $744 $194 $1,497_____________________(1)In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.52Tables of ContentsITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment PortfolioThere has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during the last four fiscal years. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2012 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2012, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.06% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 1.22%.

Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2012, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $1 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2012, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $6 million.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either JP Morgan's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information.53Tables of ContentsImpact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2012 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.54Tables of ContentsITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm56 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201258 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2012 and 201159 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201260 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 201261 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements632.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:Schedule PageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 96 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required.55Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 13, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 13, 2012 56Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2012 and our report dated September 13, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP San Jose, California September 13, 2012 57Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)2012 2011 2010Net revenue: Product$1,479 $1,480 $1,412Service and other2,672 2,292 1,991Total net revenue4,151 3,772 3,403Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue: Cost of product revenue145 143 144Cost of service and other revenue601 495 447Amortization of acquired technology14 12 43Selling and marketing1,118 1,040 913Research and development669 620 564General and administrative388 352 346Amortization of other acquired intangible assets39 43 42Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge— 30 —Total costs and expenses2,974 2,735 2,499Operating income from continuing operations1,177 1,037 904Interest expense(50) (60) (61)Interest and other income, net24 19 13Income from continuing operations before income taxes1,151 996 856Income tax provision384 344 292Net income from continuing operations767 652 564Net income (loss) from discontinued operations25 (18) 10Net income$792 $634 $574 Basic net income per share from continuing operations$2.59 $2.12 $1.79Basic net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations0.08 (0.06) 0.03Basic net income per share$2.67 $2.06 $1.82Shares used in basic per share calculations296 307 316 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations$2.52 $2.06 $1.74Diluted net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations0.08 (0.06) 0.03Diluted net income per share$2.60 $2.00 $1.77Shares used in diluted per share calculations305 317 325 Dividends declared per common share$0.60 $— $—See accompanying notes.58Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS July 31,(Dollars in millions, except par value; shares in thousands)2012 2011ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents$393 $722Investments351 699Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $46 and $20183 171Income taxes receivable53 72Deferred income taxes184 94Prepaid expenses and other current assets69 82Current assets before funds held for customers1,233 1,840Funds held for customers290 414Total current assets1,523 2,254Long-term investments75 63Property and equipment, net567 561Goodwill2,200 1,886Acquired intangible assets, net213 180Long-term deferred income taxes6 55Other assets100 111Total assets$4,684 $5,110LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Current portion of long-term debt$— $500Accounts payable157 129Accrued compensation and related liabilities231 215Deferred revenue443 406Other current liabilities144 141Current liabilities before customer fund deposits975 1,391Customer fund deposits290 414Total current liabilities1,265 1,805Long-term debt499 499Other long-term obligations176 190Total liabilities1,940 2,494Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value Authorized -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. With flagship products and services that include QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, we help customers solve important business and financial management problems, such as running a small business, paying bills, filing income taxes, or managing personal finances. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Our Financial Services business provides digital banking solutions to banks and credit unions. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments.In fiscal 2012 we acquired Demandforce, Inc. and in fiscal 2010 we acquired Mint Software Inc. and Medfusion, Inc. We have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7 for more information. As discussed in Note 8, in August 2012 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Websites business and in January 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.SeasonalityOur QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels.Use of EstimatesWe make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units, share-based compensation and illiquid municipal auction rate securities. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, technical support plans, financial supplies, implementation services, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Determining whether and when these criteria have been satisfied involves exercising judgment and using estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize.63Tables of ContentsIn some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services.We account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products, financial supplies such as printed check stock, and merchant services hardware such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones, when legal title transfers. This is generally when our customers download products from the Web, when we ship the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell some of our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken desktop software products on consignment to certain retailers. We recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For software products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract. We record product revenue net of our sales tax obligations.We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.Service and Other RevenueOur service revenue consists primarily of hosted services such as QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Online, payroll services, electronic merchant payment processing services, electronic tax filing services, and outsourced online banking services for financial institutions. Our service revenue also includes QuickBooks technical support plans in our Financial Management Solutions segment and implementation fees in our Financial Services segment and our Intuit Health business.We recognize revenue from hosted services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest that we earn on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.We offer several QuickBooks technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. We recognize revenue for upfront fees for implementation services in our Financial Services segment and our Intuit Health business ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners. We typically recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. Multiple Element ArrangementsWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, hosted services, technical support, and hardware. Our multiple element arrangements are predominantly software and software-related. Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Software and Software-Related ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, such as QuickBooks desktop software and paid technical support plans, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the 64Tables of Contentsundelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services.Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Non-Software ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain non-software elements such as hosted services or credit card readers for mobile phones, we: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence of fair value (VSOE) of fair value if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements using the relative selling price method. Once we have allocated the total price among the various elements, we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met for each element.VSOE generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and we are normally able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements; however, in certain limited instances VSOE cannot be established. This may be because we infrequently sell each element separately, do not price products or services within a narrow range, or have a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish selling price for each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. ESP is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, type of customer, geographies, stage of product lifecycle, internal costs, and gross margin objectives. Significant pricing practices that we take into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable, and our price lists. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by management, taking into consideration our overall go-to-market strategy. Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service and free technical support costs in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products, since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations.65Tables of ContentsInternal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to computer software obtained or developed for internal use. Software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Software developed for internal use has generally been used to deliver hosted services to our customers. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years.AdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $151 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012, $177 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 and $153 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010.LeasesWe review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations.We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.66Tables of ContentsWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.Computation of Net Income Per ShareWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.Beginning in July 2012, all of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share. 67Tables of ContentsThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities that we carry at fair value. Long-term investments consist of municipal auction rate securities and an available-for-sale corporate equity investment that we carry at fair value. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, we estimate the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 2 for more information. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities.Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically identified as uncollectible, we provide an allowance based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our 68Tables of Contentshistorical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance.Funds Held for Customers and Customer Fund DepositsFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade available-for-sale debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination) in a manner that is generally similar to the previous purchase method of accounting.Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the 69Tables of Contentsbusiness, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, ""Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,"" for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 or 2010.Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, ""Fair Value Measurements - Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,"" for a discussion of the acquired intangible asset impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. We recorded no impairment charges for acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 or 2010.Share-Based Compensation PlansWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. Beginning in July 2012 all of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.See Note 12, ""Stockholders' Equity,"" for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.70Tables of ContentsConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2012 or 2011.We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)”On June 16, 2011 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2011-05) and on December 23, 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, ""Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05."" These updates amend ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income” to provide that total comprehensive income will be reported in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements of financial performance. Presentation of total comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity or the footnotes will no longer be allowed. The calculation of net income and basic and diluted net income per share will not be affected. Retrospective adoption is required. ASU 2011-005 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2011, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2012. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.ASU 2011-08, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)”On September 15, 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment” (ASU 2011-08)."" This update amends ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” to give companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may allow them to skip the annual two-step test and reduce costs. ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2012. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.71Tables of Contents2. Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.

Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of debt. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Obligations and Commitments,"" for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. Financial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are no longer liquid. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.The following table presents a reconciliation of activity for our Level 3 assets for the periods shown.

Any significant changes in the inputs to the model may have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of these securities.73Tables of ContentsUsing our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were approximately equal to their par values. As a result, we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended. These securities were included in long-term investments on our balance sheets at July 31, 2012 and 2011 based on the maturities of the underlying securities at those dates. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in conjunction with our annual planning and budgeting process. In step one of the test we compared the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying values. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units. We determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units except Intuit Health exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. The estimated fair value of our Intuit Health reporting unit, which is part of our Other Businesses segment, fell below its carrying value of $75 million. As a result, we completed step two of the test by allocating the fair value of that reporting unit calculated in step one of the test to all of the assets and liabilities of the unit, as if we had just acquired it in a business combination. In comparing the residual goodwill resulting from this calculation to the carrying value of the goodwill, we determined that the goodwill and acquired intangible assets for our Intuit Health reporting unit were impaired. All of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets associated with our Intuit Health reporting unit were derived from our fiscal 2010 acquisition of Medfusion, Inc. Circumstances that negatively affected our estimate of the fair value of the Intuit Health reporting unit included unforeseen delays in developing high quality, timely offerings and marketing them effectively. We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $30 million for our Intuit Health reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $24 million and an acquired intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $6 million.3.

Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 were not significant. The gross unrealized gain on our available-for-sale equity security, which we classify as a long-term investment based on our intention to hold it for more than twelve months, was approximately $28 million at July 31, 2012. See Note 6, ""Other Comprehensive Income,"" for more information.We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2012 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Unrealized losses at July 31, 2012 were not significant and are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. We do not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.

Capital in progress at July 31, 2011 consisted primarily of costs related to internal use software projects. As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Software Development Costs,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $51 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; $99 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and $56 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $30 million, $35 million and $28 million. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years.5.

Business CombinationsWe completed the business combinations described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2012. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management.Fiscal 2012 Business Combinations Demandforce, Inc.On May 18, 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Demandforce, Inc. for total cash and other consideration of approximately $449 million. The $449 million included approximately $44 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Demandforce is a provider of online marketing and customer communication solutions for small businesses and became part of our Financial Management Solutions segment. We acquired Demandforce to expand our online small business offerings in support of our connected services strategy. Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $4 million of the consideration to net tangible liabilities and approximately $93 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately 78Tables of Contents$316 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of six years.

The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million is being charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment.

We allocated approximately $1 million of the consideration to net tangible assets and approximately $43 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $102 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years.8. Discontinued OperationsIntuit WebsitesIn July 2012 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Websites business, which was a component of our Financial Management Solutions reporting segment. The decision was the result of a shift in our strategy for helping small businesses to establish an online presence. On August 10, 2012 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Websites business, subject to closing conditions. We expect the sale to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and we do not expect to record a loss on the transaction.We determined that our Intuit Websites business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Websites at July 31, 2012 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date. We also classified our Intuit Websites business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was $76 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; $79 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and $52 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. Net income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 included a net loss from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $11 million and $36 million in tax benefits from 79Tables of Contentsthe anticipated sale of this business. We recorded net losses from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $18 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 and $25 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.Intuit Real Estate SolutionsOn January 15, 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES) business for approximately $128 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $35 million, which included $72 million for goodwill and $23 million for income taxes. The decision to sell IRES was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and services. IRES was part of our Other Businesses segment. We accounted for IRES as discontinued operations and have therefore segregated the operating results of IRES from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net revenue from IRES was $33 million and net income excluding the net gain on disposal was less than $1 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. Because IRES operating cash flows were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. We have presented the effect of the net gain on disposal of IRES in net income from discontinued operations on our statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010.9. Current LiabilitiesCurrent Portion of Long-Term DebtThe current portion of long-term debt at July 31, 2011 consisted of $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012, less the unamortized discount. During fiscal 2012 we repaid those notes when they became due using cash from operations. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Obligations and Commitments - Long-Term Debt,"" for more information.Unsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 17, 2017. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either JP Morgan's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2012. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. To date we have not borrowed under this credit facility.Other Current LiabilitiesOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2012 2011Reserve for product returns$19 $20Reserve for rebates17 11Current portion of license fee payable10 10Current portion of deferred rent8 7Interest payable10 21Executive deferred compensation plan liabilities56 50Other24 22Total other current liabilities$144 $14180Tables of Contents10. Long-Term Obligations and CommitmentsLong-Term DebtOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) (together, the Notes), for a total principal amount of $1 billion. We transferred the 2012 Notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities during fiscal 2011 and repaid them when they became due in March 2012 using cash from operations. The 2017 Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The 2017 Notes include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. We paid $56 million in cash for interest on the Notes during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.The following table summarizes our senior unsecured notes at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2012 2011Senior notes: 5.40% fixed-rate notes, due 2012$— $5005.75% fixed-rate notes, due 2017500 500Total senior notes500 1,000Unamortized discount(1) (1)Total senior notes$499 $999 Reported as: Current portion of long-term debt$— $500Long-term debt499 499Total senior notes$499 $999Other Long-Term ObligationsOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2012 2011Total license fee payable$54 $60Total deferred rent53 52Long-term deferred revenue42 40Long-term income tax liabilities41 42Other5 13Total long-term obligations195 207Less current portion (included in other current liabilities)(19) (17)Long-term obligations due after one year$176 $190In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

The total license fee payable in the table above includes imputed interest through the dates indicated.81Tables of ContentsOperating Lease Commitments and Unconditional Purchase ObligationsWe lease office facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The leases for our corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California expire in 2024 and 2026, with options to extend the lease terms for an additional ten years at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. At July 31, 2012, the largest of these commitments related to future outsourced electronic payment fulfillment and bill management services for our Financial Services segment.Annual minimum commitments under operating leases and purchase obligations at July 31, 2012 were as shown in the table below.(In millions)OperatingLeaseCommitments PurchaseObligationsFiscal year ending July 31, 2013$57 $89201456 77201553 53201643 41201744 37Thereafter174 —Total commitments$427 $297Rent expense totaled $51 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; $48 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010.

To the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may, subject to certain limitations, be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. At July 31, 2012, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes had not been provided was approximately $43 million. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $12 million. The deferred tax asset for the net basis difference in the Intuit Websites investment held for sale is $36 million, for which we recorded the related tax benefit to net income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2012. See Note 8, ""Discontinued Operations,"" for more information.The components of total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, as shown on our balance sheets were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2012 2011Current deferred income taxes$184 $94Long-term deferred income taxes6 55Total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance$190 $149At July 31, 2012, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $62 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2022. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.84Tables of ContentsAt July 31, 2012, we had excess federal foreign tax credits of approximately $10 million, of which $2 million can be carried back and $8 million can be carried forward. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. The foreign source income limitation may result in the expiration of foreign tax credits before utilization.At July 31, 2012, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $161 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $8 million and a valuation allowance of $6 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2014. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2012 2011 2010Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance$41 $35 $40Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions3 2 3Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years(9) — (5)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year3 4 3Lapses of statutes of limitations— — (6)Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance$38 $41 $35The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2012 was $38 million. Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $28 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $28 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2006, and for years prior to fiscal 2005. For California tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2007.We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were also not significant.12. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramsIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 16.9 million shares of our common stock for $900 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; 28.2 million shares for $1.4 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and 28.7 million shares for $900 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. At July 31, 2012, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.7 billion for stock repurchases through August 15, 2014. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.85Tables of ContentsDividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2012 we declared and paid cash dividends that totaled $0.60 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $178 million. In August 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2012 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 10, 2012. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Description of 2005 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 19, 2011 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 19, 2015. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 96,000,000 shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. At July 31, 2012, there were approximately 21.8 million shares available for grant under this plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.Description of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 20,800,000 shares under the ESPP, which expires on July 27, 2015. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 1,031,483 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; 840,654 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and 1,120,030 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. At July 31, 2012, there were 4,749,188 shares available for issuance under this plan.86Tables of ContentsShare-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded for the periods shown.

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.As discussed below under ""Dividends,"" in July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future. Since RSU holders were not entitled to dividends, starting in July 2011 we began reducing the market price of our stock on the date of grant, which is used in the intrinsic value method, by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. Beginning in July 2012, all of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we no longer adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends. 87Tables of ContentsExpected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. Prior to July 2011, we paid no cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate paying any cash dividends, so we used an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. In July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay quarterly cash dividends in the future and as a result we began using an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during fiscal 2012 and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future. Forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2012 2011 2010Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range)27% - 33% 27% - 30% 24% - 30%Weighted average expected volatility29% 28% 28%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.43% - 0.85% 0.87% - 1.91% 1.37% - 2.82%Expected dividend yield (1)1.02% - 1.20% 0% - 1.20% 0% Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range)24% - 33% 27% - 33% 22% - 29%Weighted average expected volatility29% 29% 26%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.00% - 0.10% 0.05% - 0.16% 0.04% - 0.16%Expected dividend yield1.00% - 1.20% 0% 0%__________________(1)Expected dividend yield assumption was zero for fiscal 2011 option grants prior to July 2011. In July 2011 we determined that it was probable that we would pay cash dividends in the future and as a result we began using an expected dividend yield assumption in our valuation models.

Benefit PlansExecutive Deferred Compensation PlanIn December 2004 we initially adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. We adopted this plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant 91Tables of Contentsaccounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. Employer contributions to the plan were not significant for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $56 million at July 31, 2012 and $50 million at July 31, 2011. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar performing assets. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets.401(k) PlanIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 30% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching contributions were $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012; $34 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011; and $32 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010.14. LitigationOn January 13, 2012, two putative class actions were filed against Intuit Inc. in connection with our TurboTax income tax preparation software: Smith v. Intuit Inc. (U.S. District Court, Northern District of California) and Quildon v. Intuit Inc. (California Superior Court, Santa Clara County). The plaintiffs in both cases assert that the fees charged for the refund processing service offered within TurboTax are “refund anticipation loans” and the disclosures about those fees do not comply with California and federal laws. The Smith case was brought in federal court on behalf of a proposed nationwide class and subclasses; the Quildon case was brought in state court on behalf of a proposed California class and subclasses. Otherwise the two complaints are substantively identical. In each case the plaintiffs seek monetary relief (including restitution, statutory damages, treble damages, and interest) in an unspecified amount, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. On February 22, 2012, Intuit removed the Quildon case to federal court. On March 16, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the Quildon case to state court. On March 19, 2012, Intuit filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims in both cases. On May 25, 2012, the federal court remanded the Quildon case to state court and denied as moot the motion to dismiss that case. On July 10, 2012, Intuit filed a motion in state court to stay the Quildon case until the federal court resolves the Smith case, which the state court granted on August 6, 2012. On September 10, 2012, the federal court issued an order granting Intuit's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint in the Smith matter. The plaintiffs have 30 days from the date of the order to file any amended complaint. We continue to believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in these actions and intend to defend vigorously against them. We believe that liabilities associated with these cases, while possible, are not probable, and therefore we have not recorded any accrual for them as of July 31, 2012. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.15.

Professional Tax customers grew about 1% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the revenue decrease described above.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013 Professional Tax segment total net revenue increased $16 million or 4% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to price increases and new customer growth for our higher-priced offerings.Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 because costs and expenses grew in proportion to revenue.Cost of Revenue(Dollars in millions)Fiscal2015 % of RelatedRevenue Fiscal2014 % of RelatedRevenue Fiscal2013 % of RelatedRevenueCost of product revenue$139 12% $137 9% $125 9%Cost of service and other revenue556 18% 466 17% 402 16%Amortization of acquired technology30 n/a 18 n/a 13 n/aTotal cost of revenue$725 17% $621 15% $540 14%Our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping or electronically downloading our desktop software products; (2) cost of service and other revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center and support costs related to delivering online services; and (3) amortization of acquired technology, which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the deferral of QuickBooks and Professional Tax desktop software revenue described in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7. We expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to higher customer care costs for our Small Business Online Ecosystem and TurboTax Online offerings.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to higher customer care costs in our payments business, partially offset by growth in our TurboTax Online, QuickBooks Online, and online payroll offerings.

Revenue decreased $51 million or 1% and total operating expenses increased $259 million, excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015. Total net revenue results were affected by the change to our desktop software offerings described in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7. Staffing expenses increased about $96 million due to higher headcount. Operating expenses also increased about $57 million for share-based compensation expenses and about $38 million for outside services. General and administrative expenses were partially offset by a $32 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of certain assets related to our Payments business. Share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with recent business combinations. Share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” earlier in this Item 7, we also recorded $148 million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit to operating expense in fiscal 2015.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013 Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were flat at 55% in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Revenue grew $297 million and total operating expenses increased $124 million in fiscal 2014. Operating expenses increased about $90 million for staffing expenses associated with higher headcount, about $22 million for marketing programs in our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax businesses, and about $17 million for share-based compensation while expenses for outside services decreased about $40 million. Share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2014 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with business combinations. Share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest ExpenseIn March 2007 we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes that are due in March 2017. Interest expense of $27 million in fiscal 2015, $31 million in fiscal 2014, and $30 million in fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of interest on these senior notes. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.

Higher average interest rates and stable average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. Higher average invested balances and slightly higher average interest rates resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods. In fiscal 2014 we sold an available-for-sale equity security for $26 million and recorded the gain of $21 million in interest and other income on our statement of operations. Income TaxesEffective Tax RateOur effective tax rates for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 were approximately 42%, 34%, and 32%. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was approximately 36%. The differences between these rates and the federal statutory rate of 35% were primarily related to the tax benefit received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit, partially offset by state income taxes. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.Net Deferred Tax AssetsAt July 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $185 million which included a valuation allowance of $30 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, state capital and operating losses, and foreign losses. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Discontinued Operations We have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect the businesses below as discontinued operations. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented.In the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 we determined that our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses became long-lived assets held for sale and we classified them as discontinued operations.We completed the sale of our Intuit Financial Services business in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 for approximately $1.025 billion in cash and recorded a $44 million pre-tax gain on disposal that was partially offset by a related income tax provision of approximately $8 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $36 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we also completed the sale of our Intuit Health business for cash consideration that was not significant and recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on disposal that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of our Intuit Websites business for approximately $60 million in cash and recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $32 million, net of income taxes. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewAt July 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.7 billion, a decrease of $217 million from July 31, 2014 due to the factors described in “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As 41Tables of Contentsdiscussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:(Dollars in millions)July 31, 2015 July 31, 2014 $Change %ChangeCash, cash equivalents and investments$1,697 $1,914 $(217) (11)%Long-term investments27 31 (4) (13)%Long-term debt500 499 1 — %Working capital816 1,200 (384) (32)%Ratio of current assets to current liabilities1.5 : 1 1.8 : 1 We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2016. Since our operations are primarily domestic, approximately 90% of our cash, cash equivalents and investments at July 31, 2015 were located in the U.S. and none of those funds were restricted. Our only significant debt consists of $500 million in senior unsecured notes due in March 2017. We also have an unused $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases.We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.Statements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

We also received $107 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $156 million for net sales of investments. During the same period we used $1.2 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $283 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $261 million for capital expenditures. Over the next four fiscal years, we expect to invest a total of about $250 million in capital improvements to expand our headquarters campus in Mountain View, California. During fiscal 2014 we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.0 billion from the sale of our Intuit Financial Services business. We also received $165 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $1.6 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $471 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily Check Inc.), $421 million for net purchases of investments, $220 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $186 million for capital expenditures.During fiscal 2013 we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations.

During the same period we used $308 million in cash for net purchases of investments, $292 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $203 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $195 million for capital expenditures. 42Tables of ContentsStock Repurchase Programs and Dividends on Common StockAs described in Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2015, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $2.6 billion for stock repurchases through May 19, 2019.During fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 we also continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. In August 2015 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 19, 2015 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 12, 2015. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Business CombinationsOn June 16, 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Check Inc. for total cash and other consideration of approximately $369 million. The $369 million included approximately $27 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Check is now known as Mint Bills and is part of our Small Business segment. We have included the results of operations for Check in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Commitments for Senior Unsecured NotesOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2015, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $58 million. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Unsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 17, 2017. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of the key terms of this agreement, including the covenants. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2015. We may use the proceeds of any advances under this credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.Cash Held by Foreign SubsidiariesOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.7 billion at July 31, 2015. Of this amount, approximately 10% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt July 31, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 43Tables of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2015: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions)1 year years years 5 years TotalAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan$65 $— $— $— $65Senior unsecured notes— 500 — — 500Interest and fees due on long-term obligations29 29 — — 58License fee payable (1)10 20 10 — 40Operating leases (2)74 130 97 221 522Purchase obligations (3)26 67 — 1 94Total contractual obligations (4)$204 $746 $107 $222 $1,279_____________________(1)In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

(4)Other long-term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2015 included non-current income tax liabilities of $45 million which related primarily to unrecognized tax benefits. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment PortfolioWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue. 44Tables of ContentsThe following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2015 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2015, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.3% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 0.61%.

Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2015, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $3 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2015, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $11 million.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to JP Morgan’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%, in both cases based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Impact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future. As of July 31, 2015, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 45Tables of ContentsITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 47 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015 49 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015 50 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2015 and 2014 51 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015 52 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015 53 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 552.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:Schedule PageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 87 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required. 46Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 1, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 1, 2015 47Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2015 of Intuit Inc. and our report dated September 1, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California September 1, 2015 48Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)2015 2014 2013Net revenue: Product$1,146 $1,459 $1,447Service and other3,046 2,784 2,499Total net revenue4,192 4,243 3,946Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue: Cost of product revenue139 137 125Cost of service and other revenue556 466 402Amortization of acquired technology30 18 13Selling and marketing1,288 1,157 1,122Research and development798 714 647General and administrative483 444 412Amortization of other acquired intangible assets12 7 17Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges148 — —Total costs and expenses3,454 2,943 2,738Operating income from continuing operations738 1,300 1,208Interest expense(27) (31) (30)Interest and other income, net1 31 7Income from continuing operations before income taxes712 1,300 1,185Income tax provision299 447 378Net income from continuing operations413 853 807Net income (loss) from discontinued operations(48) 54 51Net income$365 $907 $858 Basic net income per share from continuing operations$1.47 $2.99 $2.72Basic net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations(0.17) 0.19 0.17Basic net income per share$1.30 $3.18 $2.89Shares used in basic per share calculations281 285 297 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations$1.45 $2.94 $2.66Diluted net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations(0.17) 0.18 0.17Diluted net income per share$1.28 $3.12 $2.83Shares used in diluted per share calculations286 291 303 Cash dividends declared per common share$1.00 $0.76 $0.68See accompanying notes. 49Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2015 2014 2013Net income$365 $907 $858Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes: Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities(1) 1 (1)Unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity security— (5) —Realized gain reclassified to net income (1)— (13) —Foreign currency translation losses(27) (5) (4)Total other comprehensive loss, net(28) (22) (5)Comprehensive income$337 $885 $853_________________________(1)Includes $21 million of realized gain on an available-for-sale equity security reclassified into interest and other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations and $8 million of related income taxes.See accompanying notes. 50Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS July 31,(Dollars in millions, except par value;

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. With flagship products and services that include QuickBooks and TurboTax, we help customers solve important business and financial management problems such as running a small business, paying bills, and filing income taxes. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” and Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information.In fiscal 2014 we acquired Check Inc. (now known as Mint Bills). We have included the results of operations for this company in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. See Note 6, “Business Combinations,” for more information. As discussed in Note 7, in September 2012 we sold our Intuit Websites business. In August 2013 we sold our Intuit Financial Services (IFS) business and our Intuit Health business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we classified our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses as discontinued operations. We have reclassified our statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated the cash flows of these businesses on our statements of cash flows. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.SeasonalityOur Consumer Tax, Professional Tax, and QuickBooks offerings have significant and distinct seasonal patterns. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. Revenue from our QuickBooks offerings tends to be highest around calendar year end, during our second and third fiscal quarters. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when our total net revenue is lower but core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels.Use of EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable, and 55Tables of Contentscollectibility is probable. Determining whether and when these criteria have been satisfied involves exercising judgment and using estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize.In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services.We account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.Product RevenuePrior to fiscal 2015, we recognized revenue from the sale of our packaged software products when legal title transferred. This generally occurred when our customers electronically downloaded products from the Internet, when we shipped the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products were delivered to retailers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for QuickBooks and Professional Tax desktop solutions that we sold from that time forward. As a result, we recognize revenue for these QuickBooks desktop solutions over the period that the enhancements and connected services are provided, which is approximately three years. We recognize revenue for these Professional Tax desktop solutions as services are provided over the calendar year, once tax forms are available from taxing agencies and the agencies are able to receive electronic tax return submissions.We recognize revenue from the sale of our financial supplies such as printed check stock and merchant services hardware such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones when legal title transfers. This is generally when we ship the products. We record product revenue net of our sales tax obligations.We sell some of our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products on consignment to certain retailers. We begin recognizing revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For software products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the period that we provide services to the customer.We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory, and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.Service and Other RevenueOur service revenue consists primarily of hosted services such as QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks desktop software term licenses, TurboTax Online, payroll services, electronic merchant payment processing services, and electronic tax filing and advice services. Our service revenue also includes QuickBooks technical support plans in our Small Business segment.We recognize revenue from hosted services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest that we earn on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.We offer several QuickBooks technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners. We typically recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. Multiple Element ArrangementsWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, hosted services, technical support, and hardware. Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Software and Software-Related ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, such as QuickBooks desktop software and paid technical support plans, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor- 56Tables of Contentsspecific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services.Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Non-Software ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain non-software elements such as hosted services or credit card readers for mobile phones, we: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence (VSOE) of fair value if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements using the relative selling price method. Once we have allocated the total price among the various elements, we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met for each element.VSOE generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and we are normally able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements; however, in certain limited instances VSOE cannot be established. This may be because we do not sell the element separately, do not price products or services within a narrow range, or have a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish selling price for each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. ESP is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, type of customer, geographies, stage of product lifecycle, internal costs, and gross margin objectives. Significant pricing practices that we take into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable, and our price lists. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by management, taking into consideration our overall go-to-market strategy. Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts and as included in certain software subscriptions on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We also include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service and other revenue. We include the costs of customer service and free technical support related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this free support as incurred.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations. 57Tables of ContentsInternal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability.AdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $229 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, $171 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014, and $182 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013.LeasesWe review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations.We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. 58Tables of ContentsWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per ShareWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights. Dividend rights are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share. 59Tables of ContentsThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities that we carry at fair value. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income on our statement of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities.Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically identified as uncollectible, we provide an allowance based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance. 60Tables of ContentsFunds Held for Customers and Customer Fund DepositsFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade available-for-sale debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not record any significant property impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, 61Tables of Contentslong-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charges that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2013. Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and LiabilitiesMeasured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a discussion of the acquired intangible asset impairment charges thatwe recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2013.Share-Based Compensation PlansWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity,” for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation. 62Tables of ContentsConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2015 or July 31, 2014.We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2014-08, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity”In April 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-08, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” This update raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures for discontinued operations and disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2015.ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” and in August 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible that more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under present U.S. GAAP. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The new standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018. Early adoption of one year prior to the required effective date is permitted. ASU 2014-09 allows adoption using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented, with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 63Tables of Contents2. Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.

See Note 9. 64Tables of ContentsThe following table summarizes our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities by balance sheet classification and level in the fair value hierarchy at the dates shown: At July 31, 2015 At July 31, 2014(In millions)Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair ValueCash equivalents: In cash and cash equivalents$533 $— $— $533 $507 $— $— $507In funds held for customers162 — — 162 145 — — 145Total cash and cash equivalents$695 $— $— $695 $652 $— $— $652Available-for-sale securities: In investments$— $889 $— $889 $— $1,065 $— $1,065In funds held for customers— 175 — 175 — 144 — 144In long-term investments— — 15 15 — — 21 21Total available-for-sale securities$— $1,064 $15 $1,079 $— $1,209 $21 $1,230We value our Level 1 assets, consisting primarily of money market funds, using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of debt. See Note 9, “Long-Term Obligations and Commitments,” for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. Financial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are no longer liquid. We estimate the fair values of these auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model. Using our discounted cash flow model, we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were approximately equal to their par values and as a result we recorded no decrease in their fair values during the twelve months then ended. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, issuers redeemed $6 million of these securities at par, leaving a remaining balance of $15 million at July 31, 2015. We continue to classify them as long-term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities at that date. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. As a result of this development, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit. We concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $263 million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $211 million as of April 30, 2015. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. Key assumptions that we used in the income approach included the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that 65Tables of Contentsconsidered the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. For the market approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We believe that the assumptions used to determine the impairment amount for the goodwill of this reporting unit are reasonable.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our Quicken business, which was part of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit, and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. As a result, we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of Quicken and the remaining components of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. In March 2013 the largest customer for our Intuit Health business acquired a company that offers similar solutions and competes with us directly in that market space. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definite-lived acquired intangible assets associated with our Intuit Health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. For goodwill, the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of our Intuit Health reporting unit. Key assumptions that we used in the income approach included the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considered the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. For the market approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. For those acquired intangible assets where the unamortized balances exceeded the undiscounted future net cash flows, we measured the amount of the impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values, which were based on projected discounted future net cash flows. We believe that the assumptions used to determine the impairment amounts for the goodwill and acquired intangible assets for this business unit are reasonable. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our Intuit Health business, which was part of our former Other Businesses reportable segment. On August 19, 2013 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant.3.

Gross realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not significant. We accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2014 were not significant. We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2015 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2015 were not significant and are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. We do not intend to sell these investments. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.

As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Internal Use Software,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $116 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; $80 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014; and $66 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $89 million, $46 million and $56 million. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category.5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsGoodwillChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2014 were as shown in the following table.

See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a description of the goodwill impairment charge we recorded for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit in fiscal 2015. The increase in goodwill in our Small Business segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 was due to a number of small acquisitions, none of which were individually significant. The increase in goodwill in our Small Business segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014 was due to the acquisition of Mint Bills (formerly Check Inc.). See Note 6, “Business Combinations,” and Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information. 68Tables of ContentsAcquired Intangible AssetsThe following table shows the cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets at the dates indicated.

(Mint Bills)On June 16, 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Check Inc. for total cash and other consideration of approximately $369 million. The $369 million included total purchase consideration of approximately $342 million and $27 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Check provides a mobile application that automates and consolidates the bill payment process in one place, reducing complexity for consumers. Check is now known as Mint Bills and is part of our Small Business segment. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information. We have included the results of operations for Check in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations. Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total purchase consideration of $342 million to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using 69Tables of Contentsinformation available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $14 million of the consideration to net tangible assets and approximately $35 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $293 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes.7. Discontinued OperationsDemandforce, QuickBase, and QuickenIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses. The decision was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on our core small business and tax strategy. We determined that these businesses became long-lived assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of these three businesses at July 31, 2015 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustments to the carrying values of these long-lived assets were necessary at that date.We also classified our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and have therefore segregated their operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations and on our balance sheets for all periods presented. Because operating cash flows from these businesses were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. Demandforce and QuickBase were part of our Small Business segment and Quicken was part of our former Consumer segment.See the table later in this Note 7 for more information on the operating results of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken at July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2014 were as shown in the following table.

We recorded a $44 million pre-tax gain on the disposal of IFS that was partially offset by a related income tax provision of approximately $8 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $36 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The decision to sell the IFS business was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on our offerings for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. The IFS business comprised substantially all of our former Financial Services reportable segment.We determined that our IFS business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying 70Tables of Contentsvalue of IFS at July 31, 2013 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date. We also classified our IFS business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and have therefore segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. See the table later in this Note for more information. Because operating cash flows from the IFS business were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. Intuit HealthIn July 2013 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Health business and on August 19, 2013 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant. We recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on the disposal of Intuit Health that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The decision to sell the Intuit Health business was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on our offerings for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. Intuit Health was part of our former Other Businesses reportable segment. We determined that our Intuit Health business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Health at July 31, 2013 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date. We also classified our Intuit Health business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. See the table later in this Note for more information. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Health business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.Intuit WebsitesIn July 2012 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Websites business, which was a component of our Small Business segment. The decision was the result of a shift in our strategy for helping small businesses to establish an online presence. On August 10, 2012 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Websites business and on September 17, 2012 we completed the sale for approximately $60 million in cash. We recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $32 million, net of income taxes. We determined that our Intuit Websites business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Websites at July 31, 2012 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date. We also classified our Intuit Websites business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. See the table later in this Note for more information. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. 71Tables of ContentsNet Income (Loss) from Discontinued OperationsNet revenue from discontinued operations, income or loss from discontinued operations before income taxes, and the components of net income (loss) from discontinued operations were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2015 2014 2013Net revenue from discontinued operations: Intuit Financial Services$— $— $325Intuit Health— 1 16Intuit Websites— — 10Demandforce115 107 80QuickBase70 57 47Quicken51 98 99Total net revenue from discontinued operations$236 $263 $577 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes: Intuit Financial Services$— $— $52Intuit Health— (1) (71)Demandforce(63) (51) (41)QuickBase11 7 10Quicken(136) 57 58Total income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes$(188) $12 $8 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Net income from Intuit Financial Services operations$— $— $34Net gain on disposal of Intuit Financial Services discontinued operations— 36 8Net loss from Intuit Health operations— — (57)Net gain on disposal of Intuit Health discontinued operations— 10 18Net gain on disposal of Intuit Websites discontinued operations— — 32Net loss from Demandforce operations(39) (30) (27)Net income from QuickBase operations7 4 6Net income (loss) from Quicken operations(140) 34 37Tax benefit from discontinued operations124 — —Total net income (loss) from discontinued operations$(48) $54 $51The tax benefit from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and the net gains on disposal of Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013 were comprised of tax benefits from the anticipated sales of those businesses. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” for more information.8. Current LiabilitiesUnsecured Revolving Credit FacilityOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 17, 2017. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either JP Morgan’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the twelve 72Tables of Contentsmonths ended July 31, 2015. We may use the proceeds of any advances under this credit facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. To date we have not borrowed under this credit facility.Other Current LiabilitiesOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2015 2014Reserve for product returns$12 $15Reserve for rebates12 21Current portion of license fee payable10 10Current portion of deferred rent8 6Interest payable10 10Executive deferred compensation plan liabilities63 62Other35 26Total other current liabilities$150 $1509. Long-Term Obligations and CommitmentsLong-Term DebtOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the Notes). We carried the Notes at face value less the unamortized discount in long-term debt on our balance sheets at July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2014. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium, and include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. We paid $29 million in cash for interest on the Notes during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, July 31, 2014 and July 31, 2013.Other Long-Term ObligationsOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2015 2014Total deferred rent$49 $52Total license fee payable34 41Long-term income tax liabilities45 32Long-term deferred income tax liabilities50 44Other13 14Total long-term obligations191 183Less current portion (included in other current liabilities)(19) (17)Long-term obligations due after one year$172 $166In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years. The total present value of the arrangement at inception was approximately $89 million. The total license fee payable in the table above includes imputed interest through the dates indicated.Operating Lease Commitments and Unconditional Purchase ObligationsWe lease office facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The leases for our corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California expire in 2024 and 2026, with options to extend the lease terms for an additional ten years at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. 73Tables of ContentsAnnual minimum commitments under operating leases and purchase obligations at July 31, 2015 were as shown in the table below.(In millions)OperatingLeaseCommitments PurchaseObligationsFiscal year ending July 31, 2016$74 $26201772 12201858 55201950 —202047 —Thereafter221 1Total commitments$522 $94 Less minimum payments to be received from non-cancellable subleases(13) Net operating lease commitments$509 Rent expense for continuing operations totaled $59 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, $54 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014, and $50 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013.

The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2014 that was retroactive to January 1, 2014. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $11 million for the retroactive effect during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. As of July 31, 2015, the federal research and experimentation credit had not been extended beyond December 31, 2014.In January 2013 the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law. The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2013 that was retroactive to January 1, 2012. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $8 million for the retroactive effect during the twelve months ended July 31, 2013.

Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 were primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance for state tax credit and foreign operating loss carryforwards, offset with a reduction in the valuation allowance for state capital loss carryforwards. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014 were primarily related to the reduction of the valuation allowance on the loss associated with the sale of our Intuit Health investment, partially offset by the increase of the valuation allowance related to state tax credit and state and foreign operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax asset for the net basis difference in the Demandforce investment held for sale was $122 million. We recorded the related tax benefit to tax benefit from discontinued operations. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information.At July 31, 2015, the deferred tax asset for the state capital loss carryforwards on the sale of Intuit Websites and Intuit Financial Services was $4 million, on which there was a valuation allowance of $1 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 the valuation allowance was reduced by $2 million and the related tax benefit was recorded to tax benefit from discontinued operations. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information. At July 31, 2015, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $23 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2029. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2015, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $115 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $7 million and a valuation allowance of $6 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2016. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2015, we had Singapore operating loss carryforwards of approximately $46 million which have an indefinite carryforward period. We recorded a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset.At July 31, 2015, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $44 million. If realized, $11 million of the carryfoward will be recognized as additional paid in capital. We recorded a full valuation on the related deferred tax asset.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2015 2014 2013Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance$40 $39 $38Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions15 4 5Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years(1) (8) (12)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year5 5 9Settlements with tax authorities(3) — (1)Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance$56 $40 $39The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2015 was $56 million. Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $37 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $37 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. 76Tables of ContentsWe file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2010. For California tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2009. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012.We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2014 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were also not significant.11. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramsIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 13.8 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; 22.5 million shares for $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014; and 4.8 million shares for $292 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2013. At July 31, 2015, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $2.6 billion for stock repurchases through May 19, 2019. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.To facilitate our stock repurchase program, from time to time we repurchase shares in the open market. On August 23, 2013 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a large financial institution to repurchase $1.4 billion of Intuit’s common stock on an accelerated basis. On August 23, 2013 we paid $1.4 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 17.6 million shares of Intuit common stock. On December 23, 2013 we received a final delivery of 2.6 million shares of Intuit common stock. We treated the ASR as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. The forward contract met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, so we did not account for it as a derivative instrument. We have reflected the shares delivered to us by the financial institution as treasury shares as of the date they were physically delivered in computing weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted net loss per share. Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.In the past we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we began issuing new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.Dividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2015 we declared and paid cash dividends that totaled $1.00 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $283 million. In August 2015 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 19, 2015 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 12, 2015. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Description of 2005 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 23, 2014 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on October 29, 2023. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 115.0 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or 77Tables of Contentsrestricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. At July 31, 2015, there were approximately 17.2 million shares available for grant under this plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.Description of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 23.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by the Board, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit’s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 892,632 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; 1,044,961 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014; and 1,172,822 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2013. At July 31, 2015, there were 4,638,773 shares available for issuance under this plan.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income from continuing operations for the periods shown.

Because we have not reclassified our statements of cash flows to segregate discontinued operations, these amounts are included in share-based compensation expense on our statements of cash flows for that period.Determining Fair ValueValuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. 78Tables of ContentsRestricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends. Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future. Forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2013Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range)22% - 24% 22% - 24% 22% - 27%Weighted average expected volatility23% 23% 23%Risk-free interest rate (range)1.13% - 1.47% 1.01% - 1.40% 0.49% - 1.05%Expected dividend yield0.93% - 1.05% 0.92% - 1.06% 1.02% - 1.18% Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range)20% - 23% 19% - 22% 20% - 24%Weighted average expected volatility21% 21% 22%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.01% - 0.15% 0.02% - 0.08% 0.05% - 0.11%Expected dividend yield0.96% - 1.19% 0.94% - 1.15% 1.04% - 1.17% 79Tables of ContentsShare-Based Awards Available for GrantA summary of share-based awards available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:(Shares in thousands)Shares Availablefor GrantBalance at July 31, 201221,760Options granted(2,607)Restricted stock units granted (1)(9,310)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)2,277Balance at July 31, 201312,120Additional shares authorized19,000Options granted(2,206)Restricted stock units granted (1)(8,959)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)4,248Balance at July 31, 201424,203Options granted(1,981)Restricted stock units granted (1)(8,053)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)3,014Balance at July 31, 201517,183________________________________(1)RSUs granted from the pool of shares available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan reduce the pool by 2.3 shares for each share granted.

Benefit PlansExecutive Deferred Compensation PlanIn December 2004 we initially adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. We adopted this plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $63 million at July 31, 2015 and $62 million at July 31, 2014. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets.401(k) PlanIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching 83Tables of Contentscontributions were $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014; and $40 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013.13. LitigationIntuit has been contacted by regulatory authorities, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, the Department of Justice and certain state Attorneys General, in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels. Intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries, including formal requests for information. In addition, we are the subject of certain actions, including putative class action lawsuits by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events. We believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against them.Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits like those described above, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.14. Segment InformationWe have defined three reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of product and service offerings.Small Business. Our Small Business segment includes the following offerings, which target small businesses and the accounting professionals who serve them.•QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software; QuickBooks technical support; and financial supplies. •QuickBooks Accountant, QuickBooks Accountant Plus, and QuickBooks Online Accountant as well as the QuickBooks ProAdvisor Program, all of which are intended for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses.•Small business payroll products and services, including online payroll offerings such as Quickbooks Online Payroll and Intuit Online Payroll; desktop payroll offerings such as QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; and full service payroll offerings such as Intuit Full Service Payroll and QuickBooks Assisted Payroll. •Payment processing services for small businesses, including merchant services such as credit and debit card processing; Web-based transaction processing services for online merchants; secure online payments for small businesses and their customers through the Intuit Commerce Network; GoPayment mobile payment processing services; and QuickBooks Point of Sale solutions.Consumer Tax.

Our Professional Tax segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada and includes Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile and Intuit Tax Online professional tax preparation products and services, electronic tax filing services, bank product transmission services, and training services.All of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items. Unallocated corporate items also include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. 84Tables of ContentsThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,” for goodwill by reportable segment.The following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated. Results for all periods presented have been adjusted to exclude results for our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Demandforce and QuickBase were part of the Small Business segment, and Quicken was part of the Consumer Ecosystem product line in the former Consumer segment. The remaining components of the Consumer Ecosystem product line are included in the Small Business segment for all periods presented and the former Consumer segment is now called the Consumer Tax segment. Results for all periods presented also exclude results for our Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health businesses, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, and our Intuit Websites business, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2015 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2015 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit’s Board of Directors.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2015. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.ITEM 9BOTHER INFORMATIONNone.PART IIIITEM 10DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEExcept for the information about our executive officers shown below, the information required by this Item 10 is incorporated by reference from the information contained in our Proxy Statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2016 Proxy Statement”) under the sections entitled “Our Board of Directors and Nominees – Directors Standing for Election,” “Corporate Governance,” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management – Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.”We maintain a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including all officers.

896878,INTU,INTUIT INC.,2016,"Item 7. Revenue in our Small Business segment decreased 2% due to the impact of these changes on our QuickBooks Desktop offerings, which more than offset QuickBooks Online revenue growth. The fiscal 2015 changes to our desktop software offerings also affected our ProConnect segment, whose revenue decreased 33% to $284 million in fiscal 2015. Revenue in our Consumer Tax segment increased 8% due to 7% growth in U.S. federal TurboTax units. See “Segment Results” later in this Item 7 for more information.Operating income from continuing operations decreased 43% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the changes we made to our desktop software offerings on fiscal 2015 revenue and due to higher costs and operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $407 million higher in the fiscal 2015 period, including increases of about $96 million for staffing, about $57 million for share-based compensation, and about $38 million for outside services. We also recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $148 million for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit in operating expense in fiscal 2015. See “Cost of Revenue” and “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 7 for more information.Net income from continuing operations decreased 52% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the decrease in operating income and a higher effective tax rate that related to the goodwill impairment charge in the fiscal 2015 period. See “Non-Operating Income and Expenses – Income Taxes” later in this Item 7 for more information. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2015 decreased 51% to $1.45, in line with the decrease in net income for that period.Segment ResultsThe information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. All of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented. 35Tables of ContentsSegment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2016, $1.01 billion in fiscal 2015, and $870 million in fiscal 2014. Unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to increases in corporate product development and selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and to higher share-based compensation expenses. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. See Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.We calculate revenue growth rates and segment operating margin figures using dollars in thousands. Those results may vary slightly from figures calculated using the dollars in millions presented.Small Business(Dollars in millions)Fiscal2016 Fiscal2015 Fiscal2014 2016-2015% Change 2015-2014% ChangeProduct revenue$709 $709 $851 Service and other revenue1,584 1,399 1,307 Total segment revenue$2,293 $2,108 $2,158 9% (2%)% of total revenue49% 50% 51% Segment operating income$874 $696 $852 26% (18%)% of related revenue38% 33% 39% Product revenue in our Small Business segment is derived primarily from QuickBooks Desktop software products, including QuickBooks Desktop Pro, QuickBooks Desktop Premier, QuickBooks Accountant Desktop, and QuickBooks Enterprise; QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; QuickBooks Point of Sale solutions; ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses; and financial supplies.

Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25%, driven by customer acquisition. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 41% and online payroll customers grew 17%. Active online payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 15%. In our Small Business Desktop Ecosystem, revenue increased 4%. QuickBooks Desktop revenue increased due to 8% unit growth and the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our QuickBooks Desktop offerings. QuickBooks Enterprise revenue grew 27%. Desktop payments revenue decreased 10% in fiscal 2016 as we focused resources on core offerings for QuickBooks merchants and deemphasized certain non-QuickBooks payments offerings.Small Business segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The increase was due to the higher revenue described above and relatively stable spending during fiscal 2016.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 Small Business segment total net revenue decreased $50 million or 2% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our QuickBooks Desktop offerings described in “Executive Overview – Overview of Financial Results” earlier in this Item 7, which more than offset Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue growth.

QuickBooks Desktop unit sales were 22% lower as we continued to emphasize QuickBooks Online while QuickBooks Enterprise revenue grew 29%.Small Business segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes to our desktop software offerings on segment revenue and cost of revenue. We expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred. Small Business segment operating income was also affected by higher expenses for data center hosting and facilities and outside services.Consumer Tax(Dollars in millions)Fiscal2016 Fiscal2015 Fiscal2014 2016-2015% Change 2015-2014% ChangeProduct revenue$226 $212 $246 Service and other revenue1,747 1,588 1,417 Total segment revenue$1,973 $1,800 $1,663 10% 8%% of total revenue42% 43% 39% Segment operating income$1,287 $1,131 $1,075 14% 5%% of related revenue65% 63% 65% Consumer Tax segment product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software.

During fiscal 2017 we expect to expand our emphasis on the value that professional accountants bring to small businesses and focus less on growing our ProConnect revenue through price increases. We expect that this will result in slower ProConnect revenue growth in fiscal 2017 than we have experienced historically.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 ProConnect segment total net revenue increased $144 million or 51% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in “Executive Overview – Overview of Financial Results” earlier in this Item 7. ProConnect customers grew about 1% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.ProConnect segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 due to the revenue increase described above and relatively stable spending during fiscal 2016.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 ProConnect segment total net revenue decreased $138 million or 33% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 due to the impact of the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in “Executive Overview – Overview of Financial Results” earlier in this Item 7. ProConnect customers grew about 1% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.ProConnect segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.

Total net revenue increased $502 million or 12% and total operating expenses increased $119 million, excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015. Total net revenue growth was affected by the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in “Executive Overview – Overview of Financial Results” earlier in this Item 7. Operating expenses increased about $28 million for higher staffing expenses, about $26 million for depreciation, about $10 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and about $34 million for share-based compensation expenses. Fiscal 2015 general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a $32 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of certain assets related to our Payments business. Share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2016 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with recent business combinations. Share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased to 65% in fiscal 2015 from 55% in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the decrease in revenue during fiscal 2015. Revenue decreased $51 million or 1% and total operating expenses increased $259 million, excluding the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015. Total net revenue results were affected by the fiscal 2015 changes we made to our desktop software offerings described in “Executive Overview – Overview of Financial Results” earlier in this Item 7. Staffing expenses increased about $96 million due to higher headcount. Operating expenses also increased about $38 million for outside services and about $57 million for share-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses were partially offset by a $32 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of certain assets related to our Payments business. Share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with recent business combinations. Share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” earlier in this Item 7, we also recorded $148 million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit to operating expense in fiscal 2015.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest ExpenseInterest expense of $35 million in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facilities. Interest expense of $27 million in fiscal 2015 and $31 million in fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes. See Note 8 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. 39Tables of ContentsInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net(In millions)Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014Interest income$3 $8 $6Net gains (losses) on executive deferred compensation plan assets— 3 6Gain on sale of available-for-sale equity security— — 21Other(7) (10) (2)Total interest and other income (expense), net$(4) $1 $31Interest income in fiscal 2016 was lower compared with fiscal 2015 due to lower average interest rates and lower average invested balances. Higher average interest rates and stable average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods. In fiscal 2014 we sold an available-for-sale equity security for $26 million and recorded the gain of $21 million in interest and other income on our statement of operations. Income TaxesEffective Tax RateOur effective tax rates for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 were approximately 33%, 42%, and 34%. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was approximately 36%. The differences between these effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 35% were primarily related to the tax benefit received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit, partially offset by state income taxes. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.Net Deferred Tax AssetsAt July 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $132 million which included a valuation allowance of $40 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, foreign losses, and state capital and operating losses. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” earlier in this Item 7 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Discontinued Operations We have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect the businesses below as discontinued operations. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented.In the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we sold our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses for $463 million in cash. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016.We sold our Intuit Financial Services business in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 for $1.025 billion in cash. We recorded a $44 million pre-tax gain on disposal that was partially offset by a related income tax provision of approximately $8 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $36 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we also sold our Intuit Health business for cash consideration that was not significant. We recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on disposal that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million. 40Tables of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewAt July 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $617 million from July 31, 2015 due to the factors described in “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:(Dollars in millions)July 31, 2016 July 31, 2015 $Change %ChangeCash, cash equivalents and investments$1,080 $1,697 $(617) (36)%Long-term investments28 27 1 4 %Short-term debt512 — 512 NMLong-term debt488 500 (12) (2)%Working capital (deficit)(637) 816 (1,453) NMRatio of current assets to current liabilities0.7 : 1 1.5 : 1 NM = Not meaningful.We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2017. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.1 billion at July 31, 2016, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 82% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. At July 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.Statements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

We also received $500 million in proceeds from our term loan, $463 million from the sales of our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses, $418 million from net sales of investments, and $89 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period 41Tables of Contentswe used $2.3 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $318 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $522 million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of certain previously leased facilities.During fiscal 2015 we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. We also received $107 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $156 million from net sales of investments. During the same period we used $1.2 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $283 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $261 million for capital expenditures.During fiscal 2014 we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.0 billion from the sale of our Intuit Financial Services business. We also received $165 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $1.6 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $471 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily Check Inc.), $421 million for net purchases of investments, $220 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $186 million for capital expenditures.Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends on Common StockAs described in Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2016, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $360 million for stock repurchases through May 19, 2019. On August 19, 2016 our Board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock.During fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 we also continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. In August 2016 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2016 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 10, 2016. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Business CombinationsOn June 16, 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Check Inc. for total cash and other consideration of approximately $369 million. The $369 million included approximately $27 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Check is now known as Mint Bills and is part of our Small Business segment. We have included the results of operations for Check in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Commitments for Senior Unsecured NotesOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2016, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $29 million. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Credit FacilitiesOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for an unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to expire on February 17, 2017. On February 1, 2016 the $745 million outstanding balance was paid in full and the credit facility was terminated.On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At July 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with 42Tables of Contentsthe institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.Under the new master credit agreement, we borrowed $500 million in the form of an unsecured term loan on February 1, 2016. We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the loan amount beginning in July 2017, with the balance payable on February 1, 2021. At July 31, 2016, $500 million was outstanding under the term loan.The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2016.Cash Held by Foreign SubsidiariesOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.1 billion at July 31, 2016. Of this amount, approximately 18% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt July 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 43Tables of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2016: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions)1 year years years 5 years TotalAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan$69 $— $— $— $69Senior unsecured notes500 — — — 500Unsecured term loan12 100 388 — 500Interest and fees due on debt39 18 12 — 69License fee payable (1)10 20 — — 30Operating leases (2)60 108 94 176 438Purchase obligations (3)29 32 — — 61Total contractual obligations (4)$719 $278 $494 $176 $1,667_____________________(1)In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment Portfolio and Interest Rate RiskWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 and Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue. 44Tables of ContentsOur cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. At July 31, 2016, our cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.1 billion and had a weighted average pre-tax yield of 0.94%. Total interest income for fiscal 2016 was $3 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2016, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $2 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2016, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $7 million.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $500 million unsecured term loan. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Bank of America’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2016 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $500 million was outstanding under the term loan.On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Impact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future. As of July 31, 2016, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 45Tables of ContentsITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 47 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 49 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 50 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 51 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 52 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 53 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 552.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:Schedule PageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 88 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required. 46Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 1, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 1, 2016 47Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2016 of Intuit Inc. and our report dated September 1, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California September 1, 2016 48Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)2016 2015 2014Net revenue: Product$1,289 $1,146 $1,459Service and other3,405 3,046 2,784Total net revenue4,694 4,192 4,243Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue: Cost of product revenue131 139 137Cost of service and other revenue599 556 466Amortization of acquired technology22 30 18Selling and marketing1,289 1,288 1,157Research and development881 798 714General and administrative518 483 444Amortization of other acquired intangible assets12 12 7Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges— 148 —Total costs and expenses3,452 3,454 2,943Operating income from continuing operations1,242 738 1,300Interest expense(35) (27) (31)Interest and other income (expense), net(4) 1 31Income from continuing operations before income taxes1,203 712 1,300Income tax provision397 299 447Net income from continuing operations806 413 853Net income (loss) from discontinued operations173 (48) 54Net income$979 $365 $907 Basic net income per share from continuing operations$3.08 $1.47 $2.99Basic net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations0.65 (0.17) 0.19Basic net income per share$3.73 $1.30 $3.18Shares used in basic per share calculations262 281 285 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations$3.04 $1.45 $2.94Diluted net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations0.65 (0.17) 0.18Diluted net income per share$3.69 $1.28 $3.12Shares used in diluted per share calculations265 286 291 Cash dividends declared per common share$1.20 $1.00 $0.76See accompanying notes. 49Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2016 2015 2014Net income$979 $365 $907Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes: Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities1 (1) 1Unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity security— — (5)Realized gain reclassified to net income (1)— — (13)Foreign currency translation losses(3) (27) (5)Total other comprehensive loss, net(2) (28) (22)Comprehensive income$977 $337 $885_________________________(1)Includes $21 million of realized gain on an available-for-sale equity security reclassified into interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and $8 million of related income taxes.See accompanying notes. 50Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS July 31,(Dollars in millions, except par value; shares in thousands)2016 2015ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents$638 $808Investments442 889Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $51 and $45108 91Income taxes receivable20 84Deferred income taxes— 231Prepaid expenses and other current assets102 94Current assets of discontinued operations— 26Current assets before funds held for customers1,310 2,223Funds held for customers304 337Total current assets1,614 2,560Long-term investments28 27Property and equipment, net1,031 682Goodwill1,282 1,266Acquired intangible assets, net44 87Long-term deferred income taxes139 5Other assets112 106Long-term assets of discontinued operations— 235Total assets$4,250 $4,968LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term debt$512 $—Accounts payable184 190Accrued compensation and related liabilities289 283Deferred revenue801 691Other current liabilities161 150Current liabilities of discontinued operations— 93Current liabilities before customer fund deposits1,947 1,407Customer fund deposits304 337Total current liabilities2,251 1,744Long-term debt488 500Long-term deferred revenue204 152Other long-term obligations146 172Long-term obligations of discontinued operations— 68Total liabilities3,089 2,636Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value Authorized -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. With flagship products and services that include QuickBooks and TurboTax, we help customers solve important business and financial management problems such as running a small business, paying bills, and filing income taxes. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” and Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information.In fiscal 2014 we acquired Check Inc. (now known as Mint Bills). We have included the results of operations for this company in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. See Note 6, “Business Combinations,” for more information. As discussed in Note 7, in fiscal 2013 we sold our Intuit Financial Services (IFS) business and our Intuit Health business. In fiscal 2016 we sold our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses. We have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect all of these businesses as discontinued operations. We have also segregated the net assets of our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses from continuing operations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2015. Because the cash flows of all of these businesses were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.SeasonalityOur Consumer Tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns and revenue from those income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated in our third fiscal quarter ending April 30.Use of EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and fair values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Determining whether and when these criteria have been satisfied involves exercising judgment and using estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize.In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services. 55Tables of ContentsWe account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.Product RevenuePrior to fiscal 2015, we recognized revenue from the sale of our packaged software products when legal title transferred. This generally occurred when our customers electronically downloaded products from the Internet, when we shipped the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products were delivered to retailers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for QuickBooks and ProConnect desktop solutions that we sold from that time forward. As a result, we recognize revenue for these QuickBooks desktop solutions over the period that the enhancements and connected services are provided, which is approximately three years. We recognize revenue for these ProConnect desktop solutions as services are provided over the calendar year, once tax forms are available from taxing agencies and the agencies are able to receive electronic tax return submissions.We recognize revenue from the sale of our financial supplies such as printed check stock and merchant services hardware such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones when legal title transfers. This is generally when we ship the products. We record product revenue net of our sales tax obligations.We sell some of our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products on consignment to certain retailers. We begin recognizing revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For software products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the period that we provide services to the customer.We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory, and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.Service and Other RevenueOur service revenue consists primarily of hosted services such as QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks desktop software term licenses, TurboTax Online, payroll services, electronic merchant payment processing services, and electronic tax filing and advice services. Our service revenue also includes QuickBooks technical support plans in our Small Business segment.We recognize revenue from hosted services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest that we earn on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.We offer several QuickBooks technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners. We typically recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. Multiple Element ArrangementsWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, hosted services, technical support, and hardware. Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Software and Software-Related ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, such as QuickBooks desktop software and paid technical support plans, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for 56Tables of Contentsundelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services.Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Non-Software ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain non-software elements such as hosted services or credit card readers for mobile phones, we: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence of fair value (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements using the relative selling price method. Once we have allocated the total price among the various elements, we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met for each element.VSOE generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and we are normally able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements; however, in certain limited instances VSOE cannot be established. This may be because we do not sell the element separately, do not price products or services within a narrow range, or have a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish selling price for each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. ESP is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, type of customer, geographies, stage of product lifecycle, internal costs, and gross margin objectives. Significant pricing practices that we take into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable, and our price lists. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by management, taking into consideration our overall go-to-market strategy. Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts and as included in certain software subscriptions on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We also include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service and other revenue. We include the costs of customer service and free technical support related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this free support as incurred.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations.Internal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability. 57Tables of ContentsAdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $229 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, $229 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, and $171 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014.LeasesWe review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations.We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax 58Tables of Contentspositions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per ShareWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights. Dividend rights are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share. 59Tables of ContentsThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities that we carry at fair value. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income on our statement of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities.Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically identified as uncollectible, we provide an allowance based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance. 60Tables of ContentsFunds Held for Customers and Customer Fund DepositsFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade available-for-sale debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not record any significant property impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, 61Tables of Contentslong-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.Share-Based Compensation PlansWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity,” for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities 62Tables of Contentsissued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2016 or July 31, 2015.We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”In August 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” This new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326)”In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This new standard requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This new standard is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, which include the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This new standard amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 63Tables of ContentsASU 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments”In September 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.” This new standard eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recorded in a business combination to reflect new information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that, if known, would have affected measurement or recognition of amounts initially recognized. As an alternative, the amendment requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the financial statements of the period in which adjustments to provisional amounts are determined, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new standard is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2015-16 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” and in August 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. This new standard supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the new standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible that more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under present U.S. GAAP. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The new standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018. Early adoption of one year prior to the required effective date is permitted. The new standard allows adoption using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented, with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.We do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our financial statements.2. Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 64Tables of Contents•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.

Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of senior unsecured notes. See Note 8, “Current Liabilities – Short-Term Debt,” for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. 65Tables of ContentsFinancial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are no longer liquid. We estimate the fair values of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model. Using our discounted cash flow model, we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were approximately equal to their par values and as a result we recorded no decrease in their fair values during the twelve months then ended. We continue to classify them as long-term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities at that date. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. As a result of this development, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit. We concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $263 million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $211 million as of April 30, 2015. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. Key assumptions that we used in the income approach included the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considered the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. For the market approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We believe that the assumptions used to determine the impairment amount for the goodwill of this reporting unit are reasonable.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our Quicken business, which was part of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit, and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. As a result, we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of Quicken and the remaining components of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. On April 1, 2016 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant.3.

Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 were not significant. We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2016 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2016 were not significant and are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. We do not intend to sell these investments. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.

Capital in progress at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 consisted primarily of costs related to internal use software projects and land and buildings that we are in the process of constructing on our headquarters campus in Mountain View, California. The balance of land and buildings in the capital in progress account was $172 million at July 31, 2016 and $100 million at July 31, 2015. As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Internal Use Software,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $103 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; $116 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; and $80 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $80 million, $89 million and $46 million, respectively. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category.5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsGoodwillChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 were as shown in the following table.

See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a description of the goodwill impairment charge we recorded for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit in fiscal 2015. The increase in goodwill in our Small Business segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 was due to a number of small acquisitions, none of which were individually significant. 68Tables of ContentsAcquired Intangible AssetsThe following table shows the cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets at the dates indicated.

(Mint Bills)On June 16, 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Check Inc. for total cash and other consideration of approximately $369 million. The $369 million included total purchase consideration of approximately $342 million and $27 million for the fair value of assumed equity awards that is being charged to expense over service periods of up to four years. Check provides a mobile application that automates and consolidates the bill payment process in one place, reducing complexity for consumers. Check is now known as Mint Bills and is part of our Small Business segment. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” for more information. We have included the results of operations for Check in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations. Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total purchase consideration of $342 million to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using 69Tables of Contentsinformation available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $14 million of the consideration to net tangible assets and approximately $35 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $293 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes.7. Discontinued OperationsDemandforce, QuickBase, and QuickenIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell ourDemandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses. On February 1, 2016 we completed the sale of our Demandforce business. On April 1, 2016 we completed the sales of our QuickBase and Quicken businesses. We received $463 million in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016. The decision to sell these businesses was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on our core small business and tax strategy. Demandforce and QuickBase were part of our Small Business segment and Quicken was part of our former Consumer segment.We determined that our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses became long-lived assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of these three businesses at July 31, 2015 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustments to the carrying values of these long-lived assets were necessary.We also classified our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and have therefore segregated their operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. We have also segregated the net assets of these businesses from continuing operations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2015. Because the cash flows of these businesses were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. See the table later in this Note 7 for more information on the operating results of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken at July 31, 2015 are shown in the following table.

We recorded a $44 million pre-tax gain on the disposal of IFS that was partially offset by a related income tax provision of approximately $8 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $36 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The decision to sell the IFS business was a result of management’s 70Tables of Contentsdesire to focus resources on our offerings for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. The IFS business comprised substantially all of our former Financial Services reportable segment.We determined that our IFS business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of IFS at July 31, 2013 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary.We also classified our IFS business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and have therefore segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. See the table later in this Note for more information. Because operating cash flows from the IFS business were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. Intuit HealthIn July 2013 management having the authority to do so formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Health business and on August 19, 2013 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant. We recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on the disposal of Intuit Health that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The decision to sell the Intuit Health business was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on our offerings for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. Intuit Health was part of our former Other Businesses reportable segment. We determined that our Intuit Health business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Health at July 31, 2013 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary.We also classified our Intuit Health business as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. See the table later in this Note for more information. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Health business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. 71Tables of ContentsNet Income (Loss) from Discontinued OperationsNet revenue from discontinued operations, income or loss from discontinued operations before income taxes, and the components of net income (loss) from discontinued operations were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2016 2015 2014Net revenue from discontinued operations: Intuit Financial Services$— $— $—Intuit Health— — 1Demandforce49 115 107QuickBase54 70 57Quicken34 51 98Total net revenue from discontinued operations$137 $236 $263 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes: Intuit Financial Services$— $— $—Intuit Health— — (1)Demandforce(10) (63) (51)QuickBase10 11 7Quicken(2) (136) 57Total income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes$(2) $(188) $12 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: Net income from Intuit Financial Services operations$— $— $—Net gain on disposal of Intuit Financial Services discontinued operations— — 36Net loss from Intuit Health operations— — —Net gain on disposal of Intuit Health discontinued operations— — 10Net loss from Demandforce operations(6) (39) (30)Net income from QuickBase operations6 7 4Net income (loss) from Quicken operations— (140) 34Net gain on disposal of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken173 124 —Total net income (loss) from discontinued operations$173 $(48) $54The net gain on disposal of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 was comprised of tax benefits from the anticipated sales of those businesses. See Note 10, “Income Taxes,” for more information.8. Current LiabilitiesShort-Term DebtOn March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carried these notes at face value less the unamortized discount on our balance sheets at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015. Because their contractual maturities are now within one year, we transferred the notes from long-term liabilities to current liabilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium, and include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. We paid $29 million in cash for interest on the notes during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, July 31, 2015, and July 31, 2014. 72Tables of ContentsUnsecured Revolving Credit FacilitiesOn February 17, 2012 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for an unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to expire on February 17, 2017. On February 1, 2016 the $745 million outstanding balance was paid in full and the credit facility was terminated.On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. See Note 9, “Long-Term Obligations and Commitments – Long-Term Debt,” for more information regarding the term loan. Under the new master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 we borrowed and repaid $250 million under this revolving credit facility and at July 31, 2016 no amounts were outstanding.Other Current LiabilitiesOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2016 2015Reserve for product returns$7 $12Reserve for rebates14 12Current portion of license fee payable10 10Current portion of deferred rent6 8Interest payable11 10Executive deferred compensation plan liabilities69 63Other44 35Total other current liabilities$161 $1509. Long-Term Obligations and CommitmentsLong-Term DebtOn February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a new five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. See Note 8, “Current Liabilities – Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities,” for more information regarding the revolving credit facility. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants. See Note 8, “Current Liabilities – Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities,” for more information. The term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the loan amount beginning in July 2017, with the balance payable on February 1, 2021. At July 31, 2016, $500 million was outstanding under the term loan, of which $12 million was classified as short-term debt. Interest on the term loan is payable monthly. We paid $4 million in cash for interest on the term loan during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016. 73Tables of ContentsOther Long-Term ObligationsOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2016 2015Total deferred rent$56 $49Total license fee payable26 34Long-term income tax liabilities54 45Long-term deferred income tax liabilities7 50Other20 13Total long-term obligations163 191Less current portion (included in other current liabilities)(17) (19)Long-term obligations due after one year$146 $172In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The leases for our corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California expire in 2024 and 2026, with options to extend the lease terms for an additional ten years at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements.In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.

This new standard requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior periods were not adjusted.We have provided a valuation allowance related to state tax credit carryforwards, foreign operating loss carryforwards, and state capital and operating loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 were primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance for foreign operating loss carryforwards, state tax credit and state capital loss carryforwards. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 were primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance for state tax credit and foreign operating loss carryforwards, offset with a reduction in the valuation allowance for state capital loss carryforwards.At July 31, 2016, the income tax expense associated with the net gain from discontinued operations consisted of $179 million related to the sale of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken, and $2 million related to the increase of valuation allowance on state capital loss carryforwards. At July 31, 2015, the deferred tax asset for the net basis difference in the Demandforce investment held for sale was $122 million. We recorded the related tax benefit to the net gain on disposal of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information.At July 31, 2015, the deferred tax asset for the state capital loss carryforwards on the sale of Intuit Websites and Intuit Financial Services was $4 million, on which there was a valuation allowance of $1 million. During the twelve months ended July 31, 76Tables of Contents2015 the valuation allowance was reduced by $2 million and the related tax benefit was recorded to tax benefit from discontinued operations. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information.At July 31, 2016, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2029. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2016, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $8 million and a valuation allowance of $5 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2017. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2016, we had Singapore operating loss carryforwards of approximately $76 million which have an indefinite carryforward period. We recorded a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset.At July 31, 2016, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $52 million. If realized, $11 million of the carryfoward will be recognized as additional paid in capital. We recorded a full valuation on the related deferred tax asset.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2016 2015 2014Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance$56 $40 $39Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions7 15 4Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years(7) (1) (8)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year15 5 5Settlements with tax authorities(11) (3) —Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance$60 $56 $40The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2016 was $60 million. Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $40 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $40 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2013. For California tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2009. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were also not significant.11. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramsIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 24.8 million shares of our common stock for $2.3 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; 13.8 million shares for $1.2 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; and 22.5 million shares for $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014. At July 31, 2016, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $360 million for stock repurchases through May 19, 2019. On August 19, 2016 our Board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.To facilitate our stock repurchase program, from time to time we repurchase shares in the open market. On August 23, 2013 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a large financial institution to repurchase $1.4 billion of 77Tables of ContentsIntuit’s common stock on an accelerated basis. On August 23, 2013 we paid $1.4 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 17.6 million shares of Intuit common stock. On December 23, 2013 we received a final delivery of 2.6 million shares of Intuit common stock. We treated the ASR as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. The forward contract met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, so we did not account for it as a derivative instrument. We have reflected the shares delivered to us by the financial institution as treasury shares as of the date they were physically delivered in computing weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted net loss per share. Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.In the past we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we began issuing new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.Dividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2016 we declared and paid cash dividends that totaled $1.20 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $318 million. In August 2016 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2016 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 10, 2016. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Description of 2005 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 23, 2014 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on October 29, 2023. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 115 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. At July 31, 2016, there were approximately 9 million shares available for grant under this plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.Description of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 23.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by the Board, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit’s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 882,206 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; 892,632 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; and 1,044,961 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014. At July 31, 2016, there were 3,756,567 shares available for issuance under this plan. 78Tables of ContentsShare-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income from continuing operations for the periods shown.

The table above also excludes share-based compensation expense for our discontinued operations, which totaled $3 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, $15 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015, and $18 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2014. Because we have not reclassified our statements of cash flows to segregate discontinued operations, these amounts are included in share-based compensation expense on our statements of cash flows for that period.Determining Fair ValueValuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends. Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the 79Tables of Contentsoption’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future. Forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2016 2015 2014Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range)22% - 26% 22% - 24% 22% - 24%Weighted average expected volatility22% 23% 23%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.98% - 1.49% 1.13% - 1.47% 1.01% - 1.40%Expected dividend yield1.06% - 1.36% 0.93% - 1.05% 0.92% - 1.06% Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range)23% - 26% 20% - 23% 19% - 22%Weighted average expected volatility25% 21% 21%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.06% - 0.47% 0.01% - 0.15% 0.02% - 0.08%Expected dividend yield1.13% - 1.34% 0.96% - 1.19% 0.94% - 1.15% 80Tables of ContentsShare-Based Awards Available for GrantA summary of share-based awards available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:(Shares in thousands)Shares Availablefor GrantBalance at July 31, 201312,120Additional shares authorized19,000Options granted(2,206)Restricted stock units granted (1)(8,959)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)4,248Balance at July 31, 201424,203Options granted(1,981)Restricted stock units granted (1)(8,053)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)3,014Balance at July 31, 201517,183Options granted(2,553)Restricted stock units granted (1)(9,364)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)3,724Balance at July 31, 20168,990________________________________(1)RSUs granted from the pool of shares available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan reduce the pool by 2.3 shares for each share granted.

Benefit PlansExecutive Deferred Compensation PlanIn December 2004 we initially adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. We adopted this plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $69 million at July 31, 2016 and $63 million at July 31, 2015. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets.401(k) PlanIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching 84Tables of Contentscontributions were $46 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015; and $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014.13. LitigationIn fiscal 2015 Intuit was contacted by regulatory authorities, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, the Department of Justice and certain state Attorneys General, which are conducting inquiries in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels. Intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries, including formal requests for information. In addition, we are the subject of certain actions, including a consolidated putative class action lawsuits by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events. We believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against them.Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits like those described above, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.14. Segment InformationWe have defined three reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of product and service offerings.Small Business. Our Small Business segment includes the following offerings, which target small businesses and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them.•QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software; QuickBooks technical support; financial supplies; and third-party applications that integrate with our offerings.•QuickBooks Online Accountant, QuickBooks Accountant Desktop, and QuickBooks Desktop Accountant Plus, as well as the QuickBooks ProAdvisor Program, all of which are intended for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses.•Small business payroll products and services, including online payroll offerings such as QuickBooks Online Payroll and Intuit Online Payroll; desktop payroll offerings such as QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; and full-service payroll offerings such as QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Intuit Full Service Payroll. •Payment processing services for small businesses, including merchant services such as credit and debit card processing; Web-based transaction processing services for online merchants; secure online payments for small businesses and their customers through the Intuit Commerce Network; GoPayment mobile payment processing services; and QuickBooks Point of Sale solutions.Consumer Tax. Our Consumer Tax segment targets consumers and includes TurboTax income tax preparation products and services and electronic tax filing services.ProConnect. Our ProConnect segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and doing the nations’ taxes. Our ProConnect professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online, electronic tax filing services, bank product transmission services, and training services.All of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items. Unallocated corporate items also include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. 85Tables of ContentsThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,” for goodwill by reportable segment.The following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated. Results for all periods presented have been adjusted to exclude results for our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Results for all periods presented also exclude results for our Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health businesses, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit’s Board of Directors.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.ITEM 9BOTHER INFORMATIONNone. 89Tables of ContentsPART IIIITEM 10DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEExcept for the information about our executive officers shown below, the information required by this Item 10 is incorporated by reference from the information contained in our Proxy Statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2017 Proxy Statement”) under the sections entitled “Our Board of Directors and Nominees – Directors Standing for Election,” “Corporate Governance,” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management – Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.”We maintain a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including all officers.

896878,INTU,INTUIT INC.,2017,"Item 7. Operating expenses increased about $28 million for higher staffing expenses, about $26 million for depreciation, about $10 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and about $34 million for share-based compensation expenses. Fiscal 2015 general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a $32 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of certain assets related to our Payments business. Share-based compensation expenses were higher in fiscal 2016 due to our assumption of certain equity awards in connection with recent business combinations. Share-based compensation expenses have also been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing. 40Tables of ContentsNon-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest ExpenseInterest expense of $31 million in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facility. Interest expense of $35 million in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facilities. Interest expense of $27 million in fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes. See Note 7 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net(In millions)Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015Interest income (1)$8 $3 $8Net gain (loss) on executive deferred compensation plan assets (2)7 — 3Other(12) (7) (10)Total interest and other income (expense), net$3 $(4) $1(1) Interest income in fiscal 2017 was higher compared with fiscal 2016 due to higher average interest rates and higher average invested balances. Interest income in fiscal 2016 was lower compared with fiscal 2015 due to lower average interest rates and lower average invested balances.(2) In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.Income TaxesEffective Tax RateOur effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 were approximately 29%, 33%, and 42%. Excluding the tax effect related to share-based compensation tax benefits resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 34%. Excluding the tax effect related to the goodwill impairment charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was approximately 36%. The differences between these effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 35% were not significant. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.Net Deferred Tax AssetsAt July 31, 2017, we had net deferred tax assets of $125 million which included a valuation allowance of $64 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, foreign losses, and state operating and capital losses. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” earlier in this Item 7 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Discontinued OperationsIn the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we sold our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses for $463 million in cash. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016. We have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented. 41Tables of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOverviewAt July 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $777 million, a decrease of $303 million from July 31, 2016 due to the factors described in “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:(Dollars in millions)July 31, 2017 July 31, 2016 $Change %ChangeCash, cash equivalents and investments$777 $1,080 $(303) (28)%Long-term investments31 28 3 11 %Short-term debt50 512 (462) (90)%Long-term debt438 488 (50) (10)%Working capital (deficit)(529) (637) 108 (17)%Ratio of current assets to current liabilities0.7 : 1 0.7 : 1 We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2018. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $777 million at July 31, 2017, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 68% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and share repurchases. At July 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. In August 2017, we borrowed $285 million under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, as our cash balance in the first fiscal quarter is seasonally low.We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.Statements of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

We also received $190 million in cash from net sales of investments, $150 million from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $73 million from the issuance of common 42Tables of Contentsstock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $662 million in cash for the repayment of debt and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $839 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $353 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $230 million for capital expenditures.During fiscal 2016 we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. We also received $500 million in proceeds from our term loan, $463 million from the sales of our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses, $418 million from net sales of investments, and $89 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $2.3 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $318 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $522 million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of certain previously leased facilities.During fiscal 2015 we generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations. We also received $107 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $156 million from net sales of investments. During the same period we used $1.2 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $283 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $261 million for capital expenditures.Stock Repurchase Programs and Dividends on Common StockAs described in Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2017, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.5 billion for stock repurchases.During fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 we also continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. In August 2017 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2017 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 10, 2017. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Credit FacilitiesOn February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At July 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.Under the master credit agreement, we borrowed $500 million in the form of an unsecured term loan on February 1, 2016. We may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the loan amount which began in July 2017, with the balance payable on February 1, 2021. At July 31, 2017, $488 million was outstanding under the term loan.The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended July 31, 2017. 43Tables of ContentsCash Held by Foreign SubsidiariesOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $777 million at July 31, 2017. Of this amount, approximately 32% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada and India. We intend to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States, if U.S. taxes have not been previously provided on the related earnings we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAt July 31, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2017: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions)1 year years years 5 years TotalAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan$83 $— $— $— $83Unsecured term loan50 100 338 — 488Interest and fees due on debt10 19 4 — 33License fee payable (1)10 10 — — 20Operating leases (2)61 100 93 130 384Purchase obligations (3)63 66 19 — 148Total contractual obligations (4)$277 $295 $454 $130 $1,156_____________________(1)In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.(3)Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.(4)Other long-term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2017 included long-term income tax liabilities of $53 million which related primarily to unrecognized tax benefits. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 44Tables of ContentsITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment Portfolio and Interest Rate RiskWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control.Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments or European sovereign debt in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 and Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. At July 31, 2017, our cash equivalents and investments totaled $644 million and had a weighted average pre-tax yield of 1.47%. Total interest income for fiscal 2017 was $8 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2017, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $1 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2017, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $4 million.We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $500 million unsecured term loan. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Bank of America’s alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under all of these elections are based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense fluctuates with changes in the general level of these interest rates. At July 31, 2017 no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $488 million was outstanding under the term loan. See Note 7 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Impact of Foreign Currency Rate ChangesThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds) into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, the impact of currency fluctuations could be material in the future. As of July 31, 2017, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 45Tables of ContentsITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA1.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 47 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017 49 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017 50 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2017 and 2016 51 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017 52 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017 53 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 552.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULESThe following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this Report and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements:Schedule PageII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 84 All other schedules not listed above have been omitted because they are inapplicable or are not required. 46Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaSeptember 1, 2017 47Tables of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2017 of Intuit Inc. and our report dated September 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California September 1, 2017 48Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions, except per share amounts)2017 2016 2015Net revenue: Product$1,376 $1,289 $1,146Service and other3,801 3,405 3,046Total net revenue5,177 4,694 4,192Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue: Cost of product revenue120 131 139Cost of service and other revenue677 599 556Amortization of acquired technology12 22 30Selling and marketing1,420 1,289 1,288Research and development998 881 798General and administrative553 518 483Amortization of other acquired intangible assets2 12 12Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges— — 148Total costs and expenses3,782 3,452 3,454Operating income from continuing operations1,395 1,242 738Interest expense(31) (35) (27)Interest and other income (expense), net3 (4) 1Income from continuing operations before income taxes1,367 1,203 712Income tax provision396 397 299Net income from continuing operations971 806 413Net income (loss) from discontinued operations— 173 (48)Net income$971 $979 $365 Basic net income per share from continuing operations$3.78 $3.08 $1.47Basic net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations— 0.65 (0.17)Basic net income per share$3.78 $3.73 $1.30Shares used in basic per share calculations257 262 281 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations$3.72 $3.04 $1.45Diluted net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations— 0.65 (0.17)Diluted net income per share$3.72 $3.69 $1.28Shares used in diluted per share calculations261 265 286 Cash dividends declared per common share$1.36 $1.20 $1.00See accompanying notes. 49Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2017 2016 2015Net income$971 $979 $365Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes: Unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale debt securities(1) 1 (1)Foreign currency translation gain (loss)11 (3) (27)Total other comprehensive income (loss), net10 (2) (28)Comprehensive income$981 $977 $337See accompanying notes. 50Tables of ContentsINTUIT INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS July 31,(Dollars in millions, except par value; shares in thousands)2017 2016ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents$529 $638Investments248 442Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $46 and $51103 108Income taxes receivable63 20Prepaid expenses and other current assets100 102Current assets before funds held for customers1,043 1,310Funds held for customers372 304Total current assets1,415 1,614Long-term investments31 28Property and equipment, net1,030 1,031Goodwill1,295 1,282Acquired intangible assets, net22 44Long-term deferred income taxes132 139Other assets143 112Total assets$4,068 $4,250LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Short-term debt$50 $512Accounts payable157 184Accrued compensation and related liabilities300 289Deferred revenue887 801Other current liabilities178 161Current liabilities before customer fund deposits1,572 1,947Customer fund deposits372 304Total current liabilities1,944 2,251Long-term debt438 488Long-term deferred revenue202 204Other long-term obligations130 146Total liabilities2,714 3,089Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value Authorized -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessIntuit helps consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed prosper by delivering financial management and compliance products and services. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us reach small business customers.Our flagship brands, QuickBooks and TurboTax, help customers run their small businesses, pay employees and bills, separate business and personal expenses, track their money, and file income taxes. ProSeries and Lacerte are our leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments. See Note 6, “Discontinued Operations,” and Note 13, “Segment Information,” for more information.As discussed in Note 6, in fiscal 2016 we sold our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses. We have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect all of these businesses as discontinued operations. Because the cash flows of all of these businesses were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.SeasonalityOur Consumer Tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns and revenue from those income tax preparation products and services is heavily concentrated in our third fiscal quarter ending April 30.Use of EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns, promotional discounts and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and fair values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Determining whether and when these criteria have been satisfied involves exercising judgment and using estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize.In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services. 55Tables of ContentsWe account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.Product RevenuePrior to fiscal 2015, we recognized revenue from the sale of our packaged software products when legal title transferred. This generally occurred when our customers electronically downloaded products from the Internet, when we shipped the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products were delivered to retailers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for QuickBooks and ProConnect desktop solutions that we sold from that time forward. As a result, we recognize revenue for these QuickBooks desktop solutions over the period that the enhancements and connected services are provided, which is approximately three years. We recognize revenue for these ProConnect desktop solutions as services are provided over the calendar year, once tax forms are available from taxing agencies and the agencies are able to receive electronic tax return submissions.We recognize revenue from the sale of our financial supplies such as printed check stock and merchant services hardware such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones when legal title transfers. This is generally when we ship the products. We record product revenue net of our sales tax obligations.We sell some of our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products on consignment to certain retailers. We begin recognizing revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For software products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the period that we provide services to the customer.We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory, and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of promotional discounts and rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs.Service and Other RevenueOur service revenue consists primarily of hosted services such as QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks desktop software term licenses, TurboTax Online, payroll services, electronic merchant payment processing services, and electronic tax filing and advice services. Our service revenue also includes QuickBooks technical support plans in our Small Business segment.We recognize revenue from hosted services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest that we earn on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.We offer several QuickBooks technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners. We typically recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. Multiple Element ArrangementsWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, hosted services, technical support, and hardware. Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Software and Software-Related ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, such as QuickBooks desktop software and paid technical support plans, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) 56Tables of Contentswe have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services.Multiple Element Arrangements That Contain Non-Software ElementsFor multiple element arrangements that contain non-software elements such as hosted services or credit card readers for mobile phones, we: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, and estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements using the relative selling price method. Once we have allocated the total price among the various elements, we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met for each element.VSOE generally exists when we sell the deliverable separately and we are normally able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in these multiple element arrangements; however, in certain limited instances VSOE cannot be established. This may be because we do not sell the element separately, do not price products or services within a narrow range, or have a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish selling price for each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. ESP is the estimated price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, market conditions, competitive landscape, type of customer, geographies, stage of product lifecycle, internal costs, and gross margin objectives. Significant pricing practices that we take into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable, and our price lists. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by management, taking into consideration our overall go-to-market strategy. Shipping and HandlingWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Customer Service and Technical SupportWe include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts and as included in certain software subscriptions on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We also include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service and other revenue. We include the costs of customer service and free technical support related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this free support as incurred.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations.Internal Use SoftwareWe capitalize costs related to development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability. 57Tables of ContentsAdvertisingWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $480 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, $394 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, and $372 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015.LeasesWe review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.Capitalization of Interest ExpenseWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented. Income TaxesWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations.We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain 58Tables of Contentstax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below.Computation of Net Income (Loss) Per ShareWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.We include stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we included tax benefits in assessing whether equity awards were dilutive and in our calculations of weighted average dilutive shares under the treasury stock method.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights. Dividend rights are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share. 59Tables of ContentsThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds and time deposits in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities that we carry at fair value. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income on our statement of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities.Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically identified as uncollectible, we provide an allowance based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance. 60Tables of ContentsFunds Held for Customers and Customer Fund DepositsFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment grade available-for-sale debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not record any significant property impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015.Business CombinationsThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsGoodwillWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows 61Tables of Contentsand the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements – Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis,” for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.Share-Based Compensation PlansWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.See Note 10, “Stockholders’ Equity,” for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot 62Tables of Contentspredict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2017 or July 31, 2016.We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.Accounting Standards Recently AdoptedStock Compensation - In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” As required by ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis. Excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and we have applied this provision on a retrospective basis. We elected to early adopt this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year that began August 1, 2016. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits of $72 million in our provision for income taxes. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $59 million and $85 million with a corresponding offset to net cash used in financing activities. In addition, we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we recognized the net cumulative effect of this change as a $6 million increase to additional paid-in capital, a $2 million increase to deferred tax assets and a $4 million reduction to retained earnings as of August 1, 2016.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedGoodwill Impairment - In January 2017 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” This new standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity should compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.Business Combinations - In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” This new standard clarifies the definition of a business in order to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements.Statement of Cash Flows - In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” This new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018. The standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.Financial Instruments - In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This new standard requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.Leases - In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This new standard amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. Early 63Tables of Contentsadoption is permitted. This standard is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition - In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” and in August 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. This new standard supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the new standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible that more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under present U.S. GAAP. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The new standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which means that it will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2018.We plan to adopt Topic 606 utilizing the full retrospective transition method when it becomes effective for us in the first fiscal quarter beginning August 1, 2018. We have completed our preliminary assessment of the new standard and are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, primarily related to our Consumer Tax and ProConnect professional tax offerings. We currently believe the most significant changes to the timing and amount of revenue recognition relate to our QuickBooks desktop solutions. Under the current standard, we recognize substantially all of the transaction price for QuickBooks desktop solutions ratably over the period that enhancements and connected services are provided, which is approximately three years. Under the new standard, we will recognize software license revenue for QuickBooks desktop solutions at the time the license is delivered. Due to the upfront recognition of Quickbooks desktop solutions, upon adoption, we will remove deferred revenue from our liabilities through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings.We do not expect our annual revenue growth rates to be significantly different under Topic 606, but we do expect the timing of quarterly revenue recognition to be different as a result of these changes. Accounting for commissions under the new standard will result in the deferral of incremental commission costs for obtaining contracts, which we do not expect to be material. We do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our financial statements.2. Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value HierarchyThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:•Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.•Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.•Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are 64Tables of Contentsdetermined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.

Financial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measured using Level 2 inputs consisted of senior unsecured notes. We repaid those notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 7, “Current Liabilities – Short-Term Debt,” for more information. We measured the fair value of our senior notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. 65Tables of ContentsFinancial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are no longer liquid. We estimate the fair values of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model. Using our discounted cash flow model, we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately equal to their par values and as a result we recorded no decrease in their fair values during the twelve months then ended. We continue to classify them as long-term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities at that date. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test. Estimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.During the third quarter of fiscal 2015 there was a significant decline in the revenue and operating income forecast for our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. As a result of this development, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets for that reporting unit. We concluded that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of $263 million that reduced the carrying value of goodwill to $211 million as of April 30, 2015. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We used a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (market approach) to estimate the fair value of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. Key assumptions that we used in the income approach included the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considered the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. For the market approach, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We believe that the assumptions used to determine the impairment amount for the goodwill of this reporting unit are reasonable.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 management approved a plan to sell our Quicken business, which was part of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit, and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. As a result, we reclassified a portion of the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to discontinued operations based on the relative fair values of Quicken and the remaining components of our Consumer Ecosystem reporting unit. On April 1, 2016 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant.3.

Gross realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant. We accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016 were not significant. We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2017 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2017 were not significant and are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. We do not intend to sell these investments. In addition, it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity.The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated.

The balance of land and buildings in the capital in progress account was $172 million at July 31, 2016. The land and buildings were placed in service during fiscal 2017. As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Internal Use Software,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $128 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017; $103 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; and $116 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $99 million, $80 million and $89 million, respectively. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category.5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible AssetsGoodwillChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016 were as shown in the following table.

Discontinued OperationsOn February 1, 2016 we completed the sale of our Demandforce business. On April 1, 2016 we completed the sales of our QuickBase and Quicken businesses. We received $463 million in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016.We classified our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore segregated their operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. Because the cash flows of these businesses were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. Demandforce and QuickBase were part of our Small Business segment and Quicken was part of our former Consumer segment.Net revenue from discontinued operations was $137 million and $236 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015. We recorded net income from discontinued operations of $173 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 and a net loss from discontinued operations of $48 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. 69Tables of Contents7. Current LiabilitiesShort-Term DebtShort-term debt at July 31, 2016 included $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017, less the unamortized discount. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we repaid those notes when they became due using cash from operations. We paid $29 million in cash for interest on the notes during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, July 31, 2016, and July 31, 2015.On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. At July 31, 2017, $488 million was outstanding under the term loan, of which $50 million was classified as short-term debt. See Note 8, “Long-Term Obligations and Commitments – Long-Term Debt,” for more information regarding the term loan.Unsecured Revolving Credit FacilitiesThe master credit agreement we entered into on February 1, 2016 includes a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 we borrowed and repaid $150 million under this revolving credit facility and at July 31, 2017 no amounts were outstanding. We paid $1 million in cash for interest on the revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 and $2 million in cash for interest on revolving credit facilities during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016.Other Current LiabilitiesOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2017 2016Executive deferred compensation plan liabilities$83 $69Reserve for promotional discounts and rebates19 14Reserve for product returns7 7Current portion of license fee payable10 10Current portion of deferred rent6 6Current portion of dividend payable9 5Interest payable— 11Other44 39Total other current liabilities$178 $1618. Long-Term Obligations and CommitmentsLong-Term DebtOn February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which includes a $500 million unsecured term loan. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate. The term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our 70Tables of Contentselection, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants. See Note 7, “Current Liabilities – Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities,” for more information. The term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the loan amount which began in July 2017, with the balance payable on February 1, 2021. At July 31, 2017, $488 million was outstanding under the term loan, of which $50 million was classified as short-term debt. Interest on the term loan is payable monthly. We paid $11 million and $4 million in cash for interest on the term loan during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.Other Long-Term ObligationsOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31,(In millions)2017 2016Total deferred rent$49 $56Long-term income tax liabilities53 54Total license fee payable18 26Long-term deferred income tax liabilities7 7Other20 20Total long-term obligations147 163Less current portion (included in other current liabilities)(17) (17)Long-term obligations due after one year$130 $146In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.

The total license fee payable in the table above includes imputed interest through the dates indicated.Operating Lease Commitments and Unconditional Purchase ObligationsWe lease office facilities and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The leases for our corporate headquarters campus in Mountain View, California expire in 2024 and 2026, with options to extend the lease terms for an additional ten years at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements.In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.

For the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits of $72 million in our current provision for income taxes. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information.For periods prior to ASU 2016-09 adoption, excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation deductions are credited to stockholders’ equity rather than current tax expense. The reductions of income taxes payable resulting from share-based compensation deductions that were credited to stockholders’ equity were approximately $59 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016, and $85 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015.The sources of income from continuing operations before the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2017 2016 2015United States$1,362 $1,205 $716Foreign5 (2) (4)Total$1,367 $1,203 $712 72Tables of ContentsDifferences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% and the provision for income taxes from continuing operations were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2017 2016 2015Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,367 $1,203 $712 Statutory federal income tax$479 $421 $249State income tax, net of federal benefit24 17 15Federal research and experimentation credits(24) (33) (19)Domestic production activities deduction(34) (34) (19)Stock-based compensation14 16 15Federal excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation(69) — —Effects of non-U.S. operations5 11 12Non-deductible goodwill— — 40Other, net1 (1) 6Total provision for income taxes from continuing operations$396 $397 $299The state income tax line in the table above includes $3 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09. In December 2015 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 was signed into law. The Act includes a permanent reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit that was retroactive to January 1, 2015. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $12 million for the retroactive effect during the twelve months ended July 31 2016. In December 2014 the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law. The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2014 that was retroactive to January 1, 2014. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $11 million for the retroactive effect during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015.

Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 were primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance for state tax credit and foreign loss carryforwards. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 were primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance for foreign operating loss carryforwards, state tax credit and state capital loss carryforwards. At July 31, 2016, the income tax expense associated with the net gain from discontinued operations consisted of $179 million related to the sale of Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken, and $2 million related to the increase of valuation allowance on state capital loss carryforwards. See Note 6, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information.At July 31, 2017, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2028. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2017, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $103 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $6 million and a valuation allowance of $5 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2018. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.At July 31, 2017, we had Singapore operating loss carryforwards of approximately $92 million and Brazil operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14 million which have an indefinite carryforward period. We recorded a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset.At July 31, 2017, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $66 million. We recorded a full valuation on the related deferred tax asset.Unrecognized Tax BenefitsThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31,(In millions)2017 2016 2015Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance$60 $56 $40Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions8 7 15Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years(8) (7) (1)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year9 15 5Settlements with tax authorities(8) (11) (3)Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance$61 $60 $56The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2017 was $61 million. Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $38 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $38 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2013. For California tax returns we are currently under tax examinations for fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2015. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were also not significant. 74Tables of Contents10. Stockholders’ EquityStock Repurchase ProgramsIntuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of our common stock for $839 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017; 24.8 million shares for $2.3 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; and 13.8 million shares for $1.2 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. At July 31, 2017, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.5 billion for stock repurchases. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.In the past we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we began issuing new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.Dividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2017 we declared and paid cash dividends that totaled $1.36 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $353 million. In August 2017 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2017. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.Description of 2005 Equity Incentive PlanOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 19, 2017 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 19, 2027 and approved an additional 23.1 million shares for issuance under that plan. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 138.1 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs that were granted on or after July 21, 2016 are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. At July 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares available for grant under this plan. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. 75Tables of ContentsDescription of Employee Stock Purchase PlanOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 23.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by the Board, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit’s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.Under the ESPP, employees purchased 752,605 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017; 882,206 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; and 892,632 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. At July 31, 2017, there were 3,003,962 shares available for issuance under this plan.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income from continuing operations for the periods shown.

See Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information.We capitalized $7 million in share-based compensation related to internal use software projects during the twelve months ended July 31, 2017 and $6 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016. The table above also excludes share-based compensation expense for our discontinued operations, which totaled $3 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2016 and $15 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2015. Because we have not reclassified our statements of cash flows to segregate discontinued operations, these amounts are included in share-based compensation expense on our statements of cash flows for that period.Determining Fair ValueValuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or 76Tables of Contentsmarket goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends. Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.Dividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future. Forfeitures. We adjust share-based compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. We used historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and recorded share-based compensation expense only for those awards that were expected to vest.We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2017 2016 2015Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range)22% - 23% 22% - 26% 22% - 24%Weighted average expected volatility23% 22% 23%Risk-free interest rate (range)1.65% - 1.70% 0.98% - 1.49% 1.13% - 1.47%Expected dividend yield0.97% - 1.17% 1.06% - 1.36% 0.93% - 1.05% Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range)18% - 21% 23% - 26% 20% - 23%Weighted average expected volatility20% 25% 21%Risk-free interest rate (range)0.30% - 0.89% 0.06% - 0.47% 0.01% - 0.15%Expected dividend yield1.09% - 1.10% 1.13% - 1.34% 0.96% - 1.19% 77Tables of ContentsShare-Based Awards Available for GrantA summary of share-based awards available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:(Shares in thousands)Shares Availablefor GrantBalance at July 31, 201424,203Options granted(1,981)Restricted stock units granted (1)(8,053)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)3,014Balance at July 31, 201517,183Options granted(2,553)Restricted stock units granted (1)(9,364)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)3,724Balance at July 31, 20168,990Additional shares authorized23,110Options granted(1,786)Restricted stock units granted (1)(9,160)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)4,010Balance at July 31, 201725,164________________________________(1)RSUs granted from the pool of shares available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan reduce the pool by 2.3 shares for each share granted.

Benefit PlansNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation PlanIntuit’s Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries and up to 75% of their bonuses. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We do not guarantee above-market interest on account balances. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts, and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants may elect to receive their payments in a lump sum or installments. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death, or a change in control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.We had liabilities related to this plan of $83 million at July 31, 2017 and $69 million at July 31, 2016. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar-performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets.401(k) PlanIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching contributions were $49 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017; $46 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2016; and $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015.12. LitigationIn fiscal 2015 Intuit was contacted by regulatory authorities, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, the Department of Justice and certain state Attorneys General, which are conducting inquiries in connection with the increase during the 2015 tax season in attempts by criminals using stolen identity information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds at the state and federal levels. Intuit is cooperating with all such government inquiries, including formal requests for information. In addition, we are the subject of certain actions, including a consolidated putative class action lawsuits by individuals who claim to have suffered damages in connection with the foregoing events. We believe that the allegations contained within these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend against them.Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits like those described above, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. 81Tables of Contents13. Segment InformationWe have defined three reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of product and service offerings. Small Business: This segment targets small businesses, the self-employed, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them around the globe. Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, and payment processing solutions. Consumer Tax: This segment targets consumers and includes TurboTax income tax preparation products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada.ProConnect: This segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our ProConnect professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online. All of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items. Unallocated corporate items also include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,” for goodwill by reportable segment.The following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated. Results for all periods presented have been adjusted to exclude results for our Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken businesses, which we classified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and sold during fiscal 2016. See Note 6, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2017 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2017 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit’s Board of Directors.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2017. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.ITEM 9B - OTHER INFORMATIONNone. 85Tables of ContentsPART IIIITEM 10 - DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEExcept for the information about our executive officers shown below, the information required by this Item 10 is incorporated by reference from the information contained in our Proxy Statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2018 Proxy Statement”) under the sections entitled “Our Board of Directors and Nominees – Directors Standing for Election,” “Corporate Governance,” and “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management – Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.”We maintain a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including all officers.

The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated: July 31, July 31, $ % (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Change Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,622 $ 1,347 $ 275 20 % Long-term investments 91 97 (6 ) (6 %) Long-term debt 998 998 — 0 % Working capital 1,074 884 190 21 % Ratio of current assets to current liabilities 1.9 : 1 1.8 : 1 Auction Rate Securities At July 31, 2010, we held a total of $87 million in municipal auction rate securities which we classified as long-term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities. All of these securities are rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and are generally collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating their fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. In November 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, which gave us the option to sell UBS all of the municipal auction rate securities that we held through them at par. In June 2010 UBS settled the remaining balance of $110 million in municipal auction rate securities subject to the offer at par. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2010 will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. 52 Table of Contents Statements of Cash Flows The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 998 $ 812 $ 830 Investing activities (997 ) (432 ) (87 ) Financing activities (467 ) (110 ) (586 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1 (4 ) 1 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (465 ) $ 266 $ 158 Operating Activities During fiscal 2010 we generated $998 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $539 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $256 million and share-based compensation of $135 million. Amortization expense was lower in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 due to the completion of the amortization for certain Intuit Financial Services intangible assets that we acquired in fiscal 2007. Partially offsetting this decrease, fiscal 2010 amortization expense included a charge of $6 million for the write-off of certain acquired technology that we no longer intend to use in our Financial Management Solutions segment. During fiscal 2009 we generated $812 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $275 million and share-based compensation of $133 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due in part to depreciation for a new data center that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Share-based compensation increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. During fiscal 2008 we generated $830 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $217 million and share-based compensation of $113 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due in part to the amortization of leasehold improvements for new office facilities that we occupied in early fiscal 2008. Amortization expense increased in the same period primarily due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Share-based compensation increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. Investing Activities We used $997 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2010. We received a net $122 million in cash from the sale of our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We used $895 million in cash for net purchases of investments, $218 million in cash for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Mint and Medfusion), and $130 million in cash for capital expenditures. We used $432 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2009, including $161 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily PayCycle), $182 million for capital expenditures, and $67 million for net purchases of investments. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 included investments in a new data center which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. We used $87 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2008, including $256 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Homestead and ECHO) and $306 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by the receipt of $348 million from net sales of investments and the receipt of $132 million from the sale of our Intuit 53 Table of Contents Distribution Management Solutions business and certain outsourced payroll assets. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 included investments in a new data center and expansion of office capacity to support the expected growth in our business. Financing Activities We used $467 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2010, including $900 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the receipt of $440 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. We used $110 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2009, including $300 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by receipt of $198 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. We used $586 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2008, including $800 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $203 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2010 we repurchased 28.7 million shares of our common stock under these programs for $900 million; during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 10.9 million shares for $300 million; and during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 27.2 million shares for $800 million. At July 31, 2010, we had expended all funds authorized by our Board of Directors for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period ending on August 16, 2013. Business Combinations We completed the business combinations and acquisitions described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2010. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations. On May 21, 2010 we acquired privately held Medfusion, Inc. for total consideration of approximately $89 million. The total consideration included approximately $10 million for the fair value of cash retention bonuses that will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Medfusion is a provider of online patient-to-provider communication solutions and became part of our Other Businesses segment. On November 2, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Mint Software Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million. The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment. On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. On February 29, 2008 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million in cash. ECHO is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our Payment Solutions segment. On December 18, 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc., including all of its outstanding equity interests, for total consideration of approximately $170 million on a fully diluted basis. The total consideration was comprised of the purchase price of $146 million (which included the fair value of vested stock options assumed) plus the $24 54 Table of Contents million fair value of unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed. Homestead is a provider of website design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our Financial Management Solutions segment. Commitments for Senior Unsecured Notes On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) (together, the Notes). The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2010, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $255 million. We monitor the credit markets as part of our ongoing cash management activities. We currently intend to either pay off the 2012 Notes when they become due using operating cash or refinance those notes if the credit markets are favorable at that time. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2010. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 55 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 43 $ — $ — $ — $ 43 Senior unsecured notes — 500 — 500 1,000 Interest and fees due on long-term obligations 56 84 58 57 255 License fee payable (1) 10 20 20 40 90 Operating leases 53 88 70 71 282 Purchase obligations (2) 61 31 6 — 98 Total contractual obligations (3) $ 223 $ 723 $ 154 $ 668 $ 1,768 (1) In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. (2) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (3) Excludes $20 million of non-current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long-term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio There has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal 2009 and 2010. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control. Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2010 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2010, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.42% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 1.10%. Years Ending July 31, 2016 and (In millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $ 330 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 330 Investments 433 366 164 10 4 581 1,558 Long-term investments — — — — — 87 87 Total $ 763 $ 366 $ 164 $ 10 $ 4 $ 668 $ 1,975 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2010, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $3 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2010, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $11 million. We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Part 8 of this report for more information. 57 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2010 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 1.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 16, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP San Jose, California September 16, 2010 60 Table of Contents REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc. We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the fiscal 2010 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our report dated September 16, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP San Jose, California September 16, 2010 61 Table of Contents INTUIT INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Intuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. Our flagship products and services, including QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax, simplify small business management and payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation and filing. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Our Financial Services business, formerly known as Digital Insight, provides online banking solutions and services to banks and credit unions that help them make it easier for consumers and businesses to manage their money and pay their bills. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and reportable segments. In fiscal 2008 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. and Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO), in fiscal 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc., and in fiscal 2010 we acquired Mint Software Inc. and Medfusion, Inc. Accordingly, we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7. As discussed in Note 8, in August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business and in January 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. Use of Estimates We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units, share-based compensation and illiquid municipal auction rate securities. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates. 66 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services. We account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value. Product Revenue We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products and supplies when legal title transfers, which is generally when our customers download products from the Web, when we ship the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell some of our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Quicken products on consignment to certain retailers. We recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual time period. We record revenue net of our sales tax obligations. We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. Service Revenue We recognize revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances resulting from timing differences between when we collect these funds from customers and when we remit the funds to outside parties. We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans. Service revenue also includes Web services such as QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Online, and electronic tax filing services in both our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals segments. Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees. We recognize revenue from our outsourced online banking services for financial institutions, for which we host our consumer online banking and business banking applications, in two ways. Revenue earned for upfront fees for implementation services is recognized ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship, which is approximately seven years. Revenue and amounts billed for recurring monthly services are earned as services are performed. 67 Table of Contents Other Revenue Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party service providers. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user sales are reported to us by these partners. Multiple Element Arrangements We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). For these arrangements, which generally include software products, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold separately. In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements. We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered products or services. Shipping and Handling We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our statements of operations. Product revenue from shipping and handling was less than 2% of total product revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Customer Service and Technical Support We include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service and free technical support costs in selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products, since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment. Software Development Costs We expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our statements of operations. 68 Table of Contents Internal Use Software We capitalize costs related to computer software obtained or developed for internal use. Software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Software developed for internal use has generally been used to deliver hosted services to our customers. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years. Advertising We expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $153 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, $142 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 and $121 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. Leases We review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations. Capitalization of Interest Expense We capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was less than $10 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Foreign Currency The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Income Taxes We estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our statement of operations. 69 Table of Contents We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. Historically we have considered all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be temporarily invested outside the United States and, accordingly, we provided U.S. taxes on those earnings. Subsequent to our distribution of non-U.S. earnings in April 2010, our plans are to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in support of our international expansion plans. We provide no U.S. taxes on earnings that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. See Note 11 for more information. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” below. Computation of Net Income Per Share We compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method. We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. 70 Table of Contents The following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated. Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Numerator: Net income from continuing operations $ 539 $ 447 $ 447 Net income from discontinued operations 35 — 30 Net income $ 574 $ 447 $ 477 Denominator: Shares used in basic per share amounts: Weighted average common shares outstanding 316 322 329 Shares used in diluted per share amounts: Weighted average common shares outstanding 316 322 329 Dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards 9 8 10 Dilutive weighted average common shares outstanding 325 330 339 Basic and diluted net income per share: Basic net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.71 $ 1.39 $ 1.36 Basic net income per share from discontinued operations 0.11 — 0.09 Basic net income per share $ 1.82 $ 1.39 $ 1.45 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.66 $ 1.35 $ 1.32 Diluted net income per share from discontinued operations 0.11 — 0.09 Diluted net income per share $ 1.77 $ 1.35 $ 1.41 Weighted average stock options and restricted stock units excluded from calculation due to anti-dilutive effect 8 24 18 Cash Equivalents and Investments We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities and municipal auction rate securities that we carry at fair value. Long-term investments consist primarily of municipal auction rate securities that we carry at fair value. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, we estimate the fair values of these municipal auction rate securities based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 2 for more information. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. 71 Table of Contents We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale securities. Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance. Funds Held for Customers and Customer Fund Deposits Funds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense. Business Combinations On August 1, 2009 we adopted the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination) in a manner that is generally similar to the previous purchase method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination. Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense. 72 Table of Contents Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date. Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Goodwill We record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments described in Note 15. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets We generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as acquired technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to nine years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no impairment charges for acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. Share-Based Compensation Plans We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. 73 Table of Contents Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and amortize those values on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. We amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. See Note 12 for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation. Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results. We are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2010 or 2009. We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor. Recent Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) – Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements – a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” In October 2009 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) – Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements – a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.” This update provides amendments to the criteria in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third-party evidence is available. ASU 2009-13 also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. ASU 2009-13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2010. We are in the process of evaluating this update 74 Table of Contents and therefore have not yet determined the impact that adoption of ASU 2009-13 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2. Fair Value Measurements Fair Value Hierarchy The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows: • Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above. At July 31, 2010 At July 31, 2009 Total Total (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Assets: Cash equivalents, primarily money market funds $ 330 $ — $ — $ 330 $ 893 $ — $ — $ 893 Available-for-sale debt securities: Municipal bonds — 1,050 — 1,050 — 448 — 448 Municipal auction rate securities — — 87 87 — — 245 245 Corporate notes — 334 — 334 — 44 — 44 U.S. agency securities — 174 — 174 — 25 — 25 Total available-for-sale debt securities — 1,558 87 1,645 — 517 245 762 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 330 $ 1,558 $ 87 $ 1,975 $ 893 $ 517 $ 245 $ 1,655 Liabilities: Long-term debt (1) $ — $ 1,086 $ — $ 1,086 $ — $ 1,001 $ — $ 1,001 (1) Carrying value on our balance sheets at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009 was $998 million. See Note 9. 75 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities by balance sheet classification and level in the fair value hierarchy at the dates shown: At July 31, 2010 At July 31, 2009 Total Total (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Cash equivalents: In cash and cash equivalents $ 143 $ — $ — $ 143 $ 621 $ — $ — $ 621 In funds held for customers 187 — — 187 272 — — 272 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 330 $ — $ — $ 330 $ 893 $ — $ — $ 893 Available-for-sale debt securities: In investments $ — $ 1,408 $ — $ 1,408 $ — $ 517 $ 151 $ 668 In funds held for customers — 150 — 150 — — — — In long-term investments — — 87 87 — — 94 94 Total available-for-sale debt securities $ — $ 1,558 $ 87 $ 1,645 $ — $ 517 $ 245 $ 762 We value our Level 1 assets, consisting primarily of money market funds, using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. Financial assets whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets using quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments. Financial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of long-term debt. See Note 10. We measure the fair value of our long-term debt based on the trading prices of the senior notes and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms. There were no significant transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 or 2009. Financial assets whose fair values we measure using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs consist of municipal auction rate securities that are included in investments and long-term investments on our balance sheets. The following table presents a reconciliation of activity for our Level 3 assets for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009. Municipal Auction Rate Securities Long-Term (In millions) Investments Investments Total Balance at July 31, 2008 $ — $ 285 $ 285 Transfers from long-term to current 175 (175 ) — Settlements at par (24 ) (16 ) (40 ) Balance at July 31, 2009 151 94 245 Settlements at par (151 ) (7 ) (158 ) Balance at July 31, 2010 $ — $ 87 $ 87 In February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating their fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. The municipal auction rate securities we held were rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and were generally collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. On November 4, 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, which gave us the option to sell UBS all of the municipal auction rate securities that we held through them at par value. In June 2010 UBS settled the remaining balance of $110 million in municipal auction rate securities subject to the offer at par. We accounted for the put option at its cost of zero on the date that we entered into the agreement because we considered the value of the securities subject to the put option to be substantially equal to their par values at that date. Based on the maturities of the underlying securities, we classified the remaining balance of $87 million in municipal auction rate securities that we held as long-term investments on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. 76 Table of Contents We estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. Key inputs to our discounted cash flow model included the projected future interest rates; the likely timing of principal repayments; the probability of full repayment considering guarantees by the U.S. Department of Education of the underlying student loans or insurance by other third parties; publicly available pricing data for recently issued student loan backed securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities. The following table presents information about significant inputs to our discounted cash flow model at the dates shown: Inputs to Model at July 31, July 31, July 31, 2010 2009 2008 Range of average projected future yield rates 1.48% - 2.65% 0.63% - 3.78% 2.57% - 4.48% Range of overall discount rates used in model (like-kind security yield rate plus illiquidity factor) 1.52% - 1.77% 1.61% - 1.86% 3.45% - 3.70% Like-kind security yield rate 0.27% 0.36% 2.20% Range of illiquidity factors 125 - 150 bps 125 - 150 bps 125 - 150 bps Expected holding period in years 7 7 7 Using our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately equal to their par values. As a result, we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended. We do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents, Investments and Funds Held for Customers The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, investments and funds held for customers by balance sheet classification at the dates indicated.

Gross realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant. We accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009 were not significant. We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2010 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain available-for-sale debt securities have fair values that are below cost, we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par, which may be at maturity. The unrealized losses at July 31, 2010 are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with the specific securities. The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt securities classified by the stated maturity date of the security at the dates indicated. July 31, 2010 July 31, 2009 (In millions) Cost Fair Value Cost Fair Value Due within one year $ 432 $ 433 $ 185 $ 186 Due within two years 365 366 159 160 Due within three years 164 164 5 5 Due after three years 682 682 411 411 Total available-for-sale debt securities $ 1,643 $ 1,645 $ 760 $ 762 Available-for-sale debt securities due after three years in the table above included $87 million and $230 million in municipal auction rate securities at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009. See Note 2 for more information. Of the remaining available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2010, 89% had an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within two years of that date. 78 Table of Contents 4. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following at the dates indicated: Life in July 31, (Dollars in millions) Years 2010 2009 Equipment 3-5 $ 475 $ 460 Computer software 3-5 359 351 Furniture and fixtures 5 64 62 Leasehold improvements 2-11 229 216 Land NA 4 3 Buildings 5-30 202 202 Capital in progress NA 59 40 1,392 1,334 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (882 ) (807 ) Total property and equipment, net $ 510 $ 527 NA = Not Applicable Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to internal use software projects. As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Software Development Costs,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $56 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; $52 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $28 million, $17 million and $16 million. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to five years. 5. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009 were as shown in the following table. Our reportable segments are described in Note 15. Balance Goodwill Balance Goodwill Balance July 31, Acquired/ July 31, Acquired/ July 31, (In millions) 2008 Adjusted 2009 Adjusted 2010 Financial Management Solutions $ 153 $ (1 ) $ 152 $ (1 ) $ 151 Employee Management Solutions 152 122 274 (3 ) 271 Payment Solutions 181 1 182 — 182 Consumer Tax 30 — 30 — 30 Accounting Professionals 90 — 90 — 90 Financial Services 1,002 7 1,009 — 1,009 Other Businesses 18 (1 ) 17 164 181 Totals $ 1,626 $ 128 $ 1,754 $ 160 $ 1,914 79 Table of Contents The increase in goodwill in our Other Businesses segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 was due to the acquisitions of Mint Software Inc. and Medfusion, Inc. The increase in goodwill in our Employee Management Solutions segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 was due to the acquisition of PayCycle, Inc. See Note 7. Acquired Intangible Assets The following table shows the cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets at the dates indicated. Covenants Trade Not to Customer Purchased Names Compete (Dollars in millions) Lists Technology and Logos or Sue Total At July 31, 2010: Cost $ 438 $ 414 $ 35 $ 36 $ 923 Accumulated amortization (328 ) (301 ) (21 ) (17 ) (667 ) Acquired intangible assets, net $ 110 $ 113 $ 14 $ 19 $ 256 Weighted average life in years 6 7 7 8 7 At July 31, 2009: Cost $ 417 $ 386 $ 25 $ 35 $ 863 Accumulated amortization (286 ) (255 ) (18 ) (13 ) (572 ) Acquired intangible assets, net $ 131 $ 131 $ 7 $ 22 $ 291 Weighted average life in years 5 5 5 8 5 The increases in the cost of acquired intangible assets during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 were primarily due to our acquisitions of Mint and Medfusion. The increases in the cost of acquired intangible assets during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 were primarily due to our acquisitions of certain technology licensing rights and PayCycle. See Note 10 for more information about the technology licensing rights and Note 7 for more information about our acquisitions of PayCycle, Mint and Medfusion. 80 Table of Contents The following table shows the expected future amortization expense for our acquired intangible assets at July 31, 2010. Amortization of acquired technology is charged to cost of service and other revenue and amortization of acquired technology in our statements of operations. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets such as customer lists is charged to amortization of other acquired intangible assets in our statements of operations. If impairment events occur, they could accelerate the timing of acquired intangible asset charges. Expected Future Amortization (In millions) Expense Twelve months ending July 31, 2011 $ 75 2012 54 2013 33 2014 30 2015 26 Thereafter 38 Total expected future amortization expense $ 256 6. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income We add components of other comprehensive income, such as changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, to our net income to arrive at comprehensive net income. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, other comprehensive income was not significant. The balances in accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheets at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009 consisted primarily of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and were also not significant. 7. Business Combinations We completed the business combinations and acquisitions described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2010. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. Fiscal 2010 Business Combinations Medfusion, Inc. On May 21, 2010 we acquired privately held Medfusion, Inc. for total consideration of approximately $89 million. The total consideration included approximately $10 million for the fair value of cash retention bonuses that will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Medfusion is a provider of online patient-to-provider communication solutions and became part of our Other Businesses segment. We acquired Medfusion to expand our online healthcare offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy. Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $8 million of the consideration to net tangible liabilities and approximately $23 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We 81 Table of Contents recorded the excess consideration of approximately $62 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of six years. Mint Software Inc. On November 2, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Mint Software Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million. The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment. We acquired Mint to expand our online personal finance offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy. Under the acquisition method of accounting we allocated the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of consideration over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $1 million of the consideration to net tangible assets and approximately $43 million of the consideration to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess consideration of approximately $102 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years. Fiscal 2009 Acquisitions PayCycle, Inc. On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. We acquired PayCycle to expand our online payroll offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy. Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $5 million of the purchase price to net tangible assets and approximately $42 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $122 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years. Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions Electronic Clearing House, Inc. On February 29, 2008 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million in cash. ECHO is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our Payment Solutions segment. We acquired ECHO in order to expand our merchant services capabilities. Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $6 million of the purchase price to net tangible assets and approximately $44 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $81 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of eight years. 82 Table of Contents Homestead Technologies Inc. On December 18, 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc., including all of its outstanding equity interests, for total consideration of approximately $170 million on a fully diluted basis. The total consideration was comprised of the purchase price of $146 million (which included the fair value of vested stock options assumed) plus the $24 million fair value of unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed. Homestead is a provider of website design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our Financial Management Solutions segment. We acquired Homestead as part of our strategy to help small businesses acquire and serve customers online. Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. We recorded the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $14 million of the purchase price to net tangible assets and approximately $22 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $110 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an $11 million increase to tangible assets and a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The increase in the tangible assets was the result of a determination made after we obtained additional information regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets not previously recorded. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of five years. 8. Discontinued Operations and Dispositions Discontinued Operations On January 15, 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES) business for approximately $128 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $35 million, which included $72 million for goodwill and $23 million for income taxes. The decision to sell IRES was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and services. IRES was part of our Other Businesses segment. We determined that IRES became a discontinued operation in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. We have therefore segregated the net assets and operating results of IRES from continuing operations on our balance sheets and in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Assets held for sale at July 31, 2009 consisted primarily of goodwill. Because IRES operating cash flows were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. We have presented the effect of the net gain on disposal of IRES in net income from discontinued operations on our statements of cash flows for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $28 million, which included $42 million for goodwill and $18 million for income taxes. The decision to sell IDMS was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and services. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. We determined that IDMS became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We have therefore segregated the operating results of IDMS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Because IDMS operating cash flows were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. We have presented the effect of the gain on disposal of IDMS on our statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. 83 Table of Contents Net revenue and net income from discontinued operations were as shown in the following table for the periods indicated.

(ADP). In the twelve months ended July 31, 2008 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $52 million on our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during that period. We received a total purchase price of $94 million and recorded a total pre-tax gain of $83 million from the inception of this transaction through its completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The assets were part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. We did not account for this transaction as a discontinued operation because the operations and cash flows of the assets could not be clearly distinguished, operationally or for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of our outsourced payroll business. 9. Current Liabilities Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2010. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under this credit facility. 84 Table of Contents Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Reserve for product returns $ 20 $ 22 Reserve for rebates 11 30 Current portion of license fee payable 10 10 Current portion of deferred rent 7 7 Interest payable 21 21 Executive deferred compensation plan 43 37 Other 22 26 Total other current liabilities $ 134 $ 153 10. Long-Term Obligations and Commitments Long-Term Debt On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (together, the Notes), for a total principal amount of $1 billion. We carried the Notes at face value less the unamortized discount of $2 million on our balance sheets at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The Notes include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. We paid $56 million in cash for interest on the Notes during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Other Long-Term Obligations Other long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Total license fee payable $ 65 $ 71 Total deferred rent 60 64 Long-term deferred revenue 29 20 Long-term income tax liabilities 20 48 Other 3 4 Total long-term obligations 177 207 Less current portion (included in other current liabilities) (19 ) (20 ) Long-term obligations due after one year $ 158 $ 187 In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years. The total present value of the arrangement was approximately $89 million. The total license fee payable in the table above includes imputed interest through the dates indicated. 85 Table of Contents Operating Lease Commitments We lease office facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance. Annual minimum commitments under all of these leases are shown in the table below. Operating Lease (In millions) Commitments Fiscal year ending July 31, 2011 $ 53 2012 47 2013 41 2014 37 2015 33 Thereafter 71 Total operating lease commitments $ 282 Rent expense totaled $43 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; $44 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and $48 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. Unconditional Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. At July 31, 2010, our unconditional purchase obligations totaled approximately $98 million. 11. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Current: Federal $ 231 $ 160 $ 178 State 44 7 35 Foreign 33 12 8 308 179 221 Deferred: Federal (15 ) 24 13 State (1 ) 7 9 Foreign (16 ) (4 ) — (32 ) 27 22 Total provision for income taxes from continuing operations $ 276 $ 206 $ 243 86 Table of Contents The sources of income from continuing operations before the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 779 $ 627 $ 662 Foreign 36 26 28 Total $ 815 $ 653 $ 690 Differences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% and the provision for income taxes from continuing operations were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 815 $ 653 $ 690 Statutory federal income tax $ 285 $ 229 $ 242 State income tax, net of federal benefit 27 9 29 Federal research and experimentation credits (8 ) (20 ) (7 ) Domestic production activities deduction (14 ) (11 ) (12 ) Share-based compensation 4 4 — Tax exempt interest (2 ) (5 ) (12 ) Effects of non-U.S. operations (20 ) — — Other, net 4 — 3 Total provision for income taxes from continuing operations $ 276 $ 206 $ 243 In April 2010 we recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $20 million that were related to foreign tax credits associated with the distribution of profits from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and our plans to indefinitely reinvest substantially all remaining non-U.S. earnings in support of our international expansion plans. This tax benefit is shown in the table above on the effects of non-U.S. operations line. In January 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009. As a result of this agreement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $18 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. In October 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $7 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal year 2008 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. Excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are credited to stockholders’ equity. The reductions of income taxes payable resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs that were credited to stockholders’ equity were approximately $36 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, $18 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, and $38 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. 87 Table of Contents Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets: Accruals and reserves not currently deductible $ 30 $ 31 Deferred rent 10 12 Accrued and deferred compensation 18 1 Loss and tax credit carryforwards 63 46 Property and equipment 8 5 Share-based compensation 89 92 Other, net 4 11 Total deferred tax assets 222 198 Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets 55 59 Other, net 1 5 Total deferred tax liabilities 56 64 Total net deferred tax assets 166 134 Valuation allowance (8 ) (6 ) Total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 158 $ 128 We have provided a valuation allowance related to the benefits of certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. The valuation allowance increased $2 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, increased $6 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, and decreased $3 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. The valuation allowance increased during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 primarily due to state net operating loss carryforwards acquired in business combinations. These primarily California net operating loss carryforwards are unlikely to be realized as a result of the California legislation enacted in 2009 and effective for our fiscal 2012 which limits expected sources of future California taxable income for fiscal 2012 and beyond. We provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At July 31, 2010, there were no cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided and no unrecognized deferred tax liability. The components of total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, as shown on our balance sheets were as follows at the dates indicated: July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 Current deferred income taxes $ 117 $ 92 Long-term deferred income taxes 41 36 Total net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 158 $ 128 At July 31, 2010, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $84 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. 88 Table of Contents At July 31, 2010, we had excess federal foreign tax credits of approximately $22 million, of which $2 million can be carried back and $20 million can be carried forward. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. The foreign source income limitation may result in the expiration of foreign tax credits before utilization. At July 31, 2010, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $163 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $9 million and a valuation allowance of $7 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2014. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. Unrecognized Tax Benefits The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance $ 40 $ 45 $ 33 Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions 3 10 14 Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years (5 ) (10 ) (1 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year 3 4 8 Settlements with tax authorities — (8 ) (8 ) Lapses of statutes of limitations (6 ) (1 ) (1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance $ 35 $ 40 $ 45 The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2010 was $35 million. Net of related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $30 million at that date. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $30 million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal 2006 and for years prior to fiscal 2005. For California tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2005. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2010 and July 31, 2009 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were also not significant. 89 Table of Contents 12. Stockholders’ Equity Stock Repurchase Programs Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 28.7 million shares of our common stock for $900 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; 10.9 million shares for $300 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and 27.2 million shares for $800 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. At July 31, 2010, we had expended all funds authorized by our Board of Directors for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period ending on August 16, 2013. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount. Description of 2005 Equity Incentive Plan Our stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. Under the 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2005 Plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors according to a formula in the plan document. For other awards, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the 2005 Plan to permit the issuance of up to 65,000,000 shares under the 2005 Plan. At July 31, 2010, there were approximately 9 million shares available for grant under this plan. Up to 50% of equity awards granted each year under the 2005 Plan may have an exercise or purchase price per share that is less than full fair market value on the date of grant. All stock options granted to date under the 2005 Plan have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. All RSUs are considered to be granted at less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant because they have no exercise price. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under the 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. Description of Employee Stock Purchase Plan On November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 16,800,000 shares under the ESPP, which expires on July 27, 2015. Offering periods under the ESPP are three months in duration and shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day or the last day of the offering period. Under the ESPP, employees purchased 1,120,030 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; 1,368,005 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and 1,164,977 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. At July 31, 2010, there were 2,621,325 shares available for issuance under this plan. 90 Table of Contents Share-Based Compensation Expense The following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded for the periods shown. Twelve Months Ended July 31, (In millions except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Cost of product revenue $ 1 $ 2 $ 1 Cost of service and other revenue 7 7 6 Selling and marketing 41 45 36 Research and development 41 39 32 General and administrative 44 37 36 Discontinued operations 1 3 2 Total share-based compensation expense 135 133 113 Income tax benefit (48 ) (48 ) (45 ) Decrease in net income $ 87 $ 85 $ 68 Decrease in net income per share: Basic $ 0.28 $ 0.26 $ 0.21 Diluted $ 0.27 $ 0.26 $ 0.20 Determining Fair Value Valuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and amortize those values on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. We amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us. Expected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied 91 Table of Contents volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. Dividends. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. Forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated: Twelve Months Ended July 31, 2010 2009 2008 Assumptions for stock options: Expected volatility (range) 24% - 30 % 28% - 44 % 28% - 34 % Weighted average expected volatility 28 % 31 % 33 % Risk-free interest rate (range) 1.37% - 2.82 % 1.13% - 3.08 % 2.11% - 4.56 % Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Assumptions for ESPP: Expected volatility (range) 22% - 29 % 35% - 53 % 31% - 37 % Weighted average expected volatility 26 % 42 % 33 % Risk-free interest rate (range) 0.04% - 0.16 % 0.04% - 0.84 % 1.11% - 4.15 % Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % 92 Table of Contents Stock Option Activity and Related Share-Based Compensation Expense A summary of activity under all share-based compensation plans for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows: Options Outstanding Shares Weighted Average Available Number of Exercise Price (Shares in thousands) for Grant Shares Per Share Balance at July 31, 2007 6,411 54,490 $ 24.05 Additional shares authorized 10,000 — — Options assumed and converted in connection with acquisitions — 648 2.00 Options granted (8,320 ) 8,320 27.99 Restricted stock units granted (3,046 ) — — Options exercised — (9,101 ) 19.37 Options canceled or expired (1) 2,311 (4,151 ) 30.91 Restricted stock units forfeited (1) 620 — — Balance at July 31, 2008 7,976 50,206 24.70 Additional shares authorized 10,000 — — Options assumed and converted in connection with acquisitions — 178 6.45 Options granted (6,538 ) 6,538 28.83 Restricted stock units granted (6,242 ) — — Options exercised — (8,760 ) 19.37 Options canceled or expired (1) 2,208 (2,488 ) 29.20 Restricted stock units forfeited (1) 682 — — Balance at July 31, 2009 8,086 45,674 26.00 Additional shares authorized 9,000 Options assumed and converted in connection with business combinations — 372 3.08 Options granted (6,338 ) 6,338 35.93 Restricted stock units granted (5,253 ) — Options exercised — (17,212 ) 24.00 Options canceled or expired (1) 2,089 (2,579 ) 29.46 Restricted stock units forfeited (1) 1,177 — Balance at July 31, 2010 8,761 32,593 $ 28.45 (1) Stock options and restricted stock units canceled, expired or forfeited under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan are returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Stock options and restricted stock units canceled, expired or forfeited under older expired plans are not returned to the pool of shares available for grant. The weighted average fair values of options granted during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 was $8.73 per share; during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 was $7.86 per share; and during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008 was $8.36 per share. The total fair value of options vested during those periods was $57 million, $58 million and $61 million. 93 Table of Contents Options outstanding, exercisable and expected to vest, and exercisable as of July 31, 2010 were as follows: Weighted Average Weighted Remaining Average Aggregate Number Contractual Exercise Intrinsic of Shares Life Price per Value (in thousands) (in Years) Share (in millions) Options outstanding 32,593 4.37 $ 28.45 $ 368 Options exercisable and expected to vest 31,240 4.29 $ 28.28 $ 358 Options exercisable 20,201 3.26 $ 26.34 $ 271 Options expected to vest are unvested shares net of expected forfeitures. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at July 31, 2010 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common stock for shares that were in-the-money at that date. In-the-money options at July 31, 2010 were options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $39.75 market price of our common stock at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010 was $157 million; during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 was $79 million; and during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008 was $97 million. We recorded $67 million, $63 million and $57 million in share-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The total tax benefits related to this share-based compensation expense were $24 million, $22 million and $20 million. At July 31, 2010, there was $104 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock that we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.3 years. We received $413 million, $169 million and $176 million in cash from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The cash tax benefits that we realized related to tax deductions for non-qualified option exercises and disqualifying dispositions under all share-based payment arrangements totaled $61 million, $32 million and $38 million for those periods. Due to our ongoing program of repurchasing our common stock on the open market, at July 31, 2010 we had approximately 116 million treasury shares. We satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting from this pool of treasury shares. 94 Table of Contents Restricted Stock Unit Activity and Related Share-Based Compensation Expense A summary of restricted stock unit (RSU) activity for the periods indicated was as follows: Weighted Average Number Grant Date of Shares Fair Value Nonvested at July 31, 2007 2,504 $ 29.88 Granted 3,046 28.24 Restricted stock units assumed and converted in connection with acquisitions 562 29.78 Vested (484 ) 25.96 Forfeited (631 ) 29.52 Nonvested at July 31, 2008 4,997 29.29 Granted 6,242 26.09 Vested (1,150 ) 30.54 Forfeited (691 ) 28.53 Nonvested at July 31, 2009 9,398 27.06 Granted 5,253 36.24 Restricted stock granted in connection with business combinations 231 29.14 Vested (2,172 ) 29.30 Forfeited (1,179 ) 26.46 Nonvested at July 31, 2010 11,531 $ 30.93 The total fair value of RSUs vested was $64 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; $35 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and $11 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. We recorded $68 million, $70 million and $56 million in share-based compensation expense for RSUs for those periods. The total tax benefit related to this RSU compensation expense was $25 million, $26 million and $25 million for those periods. At July 31, 2010, there was $176 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs that we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 1.9 years. The cash tax benefits that we realized for tax deductions for RSUs totaled $24 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; $14 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and $3 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. 13. Benefit Plans Executive Deferred Compensation Plan In December 2004 we initially adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. We adopted this plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and 95 Table of Contents vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. We made employer contributions to the plan of less than $1 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. We had liabilities related to this plan of $43 million at July 31, 2010 and $37 million at July 31, 2009. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar performing assets. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets. 401(k) Plan In the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 150% of the first $1,000 and up to 75% of the next six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Matching contributions were $32 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010; $35 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009; and $34 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2008. 14. Litigation Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. 15. Segment Information We have defined seven reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.

We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items. Unallocated corporate items also include amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 5 for goodwill by reportable segment. 97 Table of Contents The following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated. Results for our Other Businesses segment have been adjusted for all periods presented to exclude results for our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business, which became a discontinued operation in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.

ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, Intuit’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2010 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit’s Board of Directors. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010. Ernst & Young has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
