OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) and professional service provider customers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good”, “better”, and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. As of December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O’Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of “purchasing up” on the value spectrum. We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers’ willingness to return to “purchasing up” on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. 26 We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. · Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions. We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and the level of unemployment declines, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry. · Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (“AAIA”), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 15% over the past decade, from 209 million light vehicles in 2001 to 241 million light vehicles in 2011. Annual new light vehicle registrations, have declined 24% over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2001 to 13 million registrations in 2011; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the “SAAR”) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2012, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed. As reported by the AAIA, vehicle scrappage rates have decreased 23% from 2001 to 2011, while the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 21% over that decade, from 8.9 years in 2001 to 10.8 years in 2011. We believe this decrease in vehicle scrappage rates and increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population. · Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs. We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer’s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2012, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased slightly to 7.8% from 8.5% as of December 31, 2011. We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of customer service and expense control. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: · Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. The Company’s Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million on each of June 1, 2012, August 10, 2012, and November 12, 2012, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $3.0 billion. The additional $500 million authorizations are effective for a 3-year period, and the most recent authorization expires on November 12, 2015. As of February 28, 2013, we had repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion under this program. · On August 21, 2012, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 (“3.800% Senior Notes due 2022”) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 27 · At the close of business on December 31, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the auto-parts-related assets of VIP Parts, Tires & Service (“VIP”). The asset purchase included 56 stores located throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as a distribution center located in Lewiston, Maine. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 49.9 51.0 51.4 Gross profit 50.1 49.0 48.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.3 34.1 35.0 Former CSK officer clawback - (0.1) - Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge - - 0.4 Operating income 15.8 15.0 13.2 Interest expense (0.7) (0.5) (0.7) Interest income 0.1 0.1 - Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs - (0.4) - Termination of interest rate swap agreements - (0.1) - Gain on settlement of note receivable - - 0.2 Other income, net - - 0.1 Income before income taxes 15.2 14.1 12.8 Provision for income taxes 5.7 5.3 5.0 Net income 9.5 % 8.8 % 7.8 % 2012 Compared to 2011 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $393 million to $6.18 billion from $5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to the Same Period in 2011 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 215 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2011, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 78 Sales in 2011 for stores that have closed (3) Sales for stores opened throughout 2012 96 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 7 Total increase in sales $ 393 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. 28 Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles. The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts. DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater. We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 190 net, new stores in 2013. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) from $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to distribution center (“DC”) efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs. This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year, however, we do not anticipate realizing this excess benefit in future periods. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) from $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The slight increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, decreased to $36 million (or 0.6% of sales), from $51 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30%. The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales), from $508 million (or 8.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. 29 Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28% to $4.75 on 123 million shares from $3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago. The impact of share repurchases during 2012 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $0.26. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O’Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This “clawback” amount was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 million ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “Other income (expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13% to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12% to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) from $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25% to $4.75 from $3.81 for the same period one year ago.

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 30 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $391 million to $5.79 billion from $5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6% and 8.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2011, Compared to the Same Period in 2010 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 241 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2010, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 70 Sales in 2010 for stores that have closed (13) Sales for stores opened throughout 2011 82 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 11 Total increase in sales $ 391 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period. The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories. During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts. We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) from $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales. Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets. The improved shrinkage was driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O’Reilly point-of-sale system (“POS”), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O’Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010. The O’Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Distribution center efficiencies were the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs. Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets grew at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy. Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. 31 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business. Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) from $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22%. The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below – see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigation of CSK (discussed in detail below – see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $51 million (or 0.9% of sales), from $23 million (or 0.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118%. The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period. In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below). Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 14%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $508 million (or 8.8% of sales), from $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 21%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26% to $3.71 on 137 million shares from $2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period in the prior year. The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $0.19. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O’Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This “clawback” amount was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 million ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “Other income (expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in “Other income (expense)” of $12 million ($7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK’s pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. We accrued $21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) among the DOJ, CSK and O’Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK. The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ 32 investigation was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18% to $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) from $734 million (or 13.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21% to $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) from $433 million (or 8.0% of sales) for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 25% to $3.81 from $3.05 for the same period in the prior year.

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. 33 Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage Liquidity and Related Ratios 2012 2011 Change Current assets $ 2,733 $ 2,608 4.8 % Quick assets (1) 429 565 (24.1) % Current liabilities 2,273 1,580 43.9 % Working capital (2) 460 1,028 (55.3) % Total debt 1,096 798 37.3 % Total equity 2,108 2,845 (25.9) % Current ratio (3) 1.20:1 1.65:1 (27.3) % Quick ratio (4) 0.20:1 0.39:1 (48.7) % Debt to equity (5) 0.52:1 0.28:1 85.7 % (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders’ equity. Current liabilities increased 44%, total debt increased 37% and total equity decreased 26% from 2011 to 2012. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% as of December 31, 2012, as compared to 64.4% one year prior. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of our unsecured $300 million 3.800% Senior Notes during 2012. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, Liquidity 2012 2011 2010 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,251,555 $ 1,118,991 $ 703,687 Investing activities (317,407) (319,653) (351,277) Financing activities (1,047,572) (467,507) (349,624) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (113,424) $ 331,831 $ 2,786 Capital expenditures $ 300,719 $ 328,319 $ 365,419 Free cash flow (a) 950,836 790,672 338,268 (a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period. Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory investment and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs. The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011. The increase in other current 34 liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation). Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year. Investing activities: The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year. Total capital expenditures were $301 million, $328 million, and $365 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened. We were able to find real estate with attractive lease factors during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior. Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures. During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O’Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011. We opened 180, 170, and 149 net, new stores in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012. We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2013. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.7 million to $1.9 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company’s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010. The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility. Credit facilities: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. We had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $57 million and $60 million as of December 13, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of 35 which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.875% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.625% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 On August 21, 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 (“3.800% Senior Notes due 2022”) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries (“Subsidiary Guarantors”) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor’s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sales or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all of the property of, the subsidiary guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2012. Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.50 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders. We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.95 times and 4.86 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.83 times and 1.75 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. 36 The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 GAAP net income $ 585,746 $ 507,673 Add: Interest expense 40,200 28,165 Rent expense 240,869 230,897 Provision for income taxes 355,775 308,100 Depreciation expense 176,705 164,579 Amortization expense 401 1,301 Non-cash share-based compensation 22,026 20,579 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs - 21,626 Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR) $ 1,421,722 $ 1,282,920 Interest expense $ 40,200 $ 28,165 Capitalized interest 6,064 4,666 Rent expense 240,869 230,897 Total fixed charges $ 287,133 $ 263,728 Fixed charge coverage ratio 4.95 4.86 GAAP debt $ 1,095,956 $ 797,574 Stand-by letters of credit 57,281 59,917 Discount on senior notes 4,366 3,683 Six-times rent expense 1,445,214 1,385,382 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 2,602,817 $ 2,246,556 Adjusted consolidated leverage ratio 1.83 1.75 The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio, adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. During 2012, our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the cumulative authorization amount to $3.0 billion. The most recent $500 million authorization is effective for a three-year period and expires November 12, 2015. Each prior $500 million authorization was effective for a three-year period beginning on the date of the additional authorization. The following table identifies shares of the Company’s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Shares repurchased 16,201 15,877 Average price per share $ 89.20 $ 61.49 Total investment $ 1,445,044 $ 976,322 37 Subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of $90.09 for a total investment of $186 million. We have repurchased a total of 34.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 through and including February 28, 2013, at an average price of $76.37 for a total aggregate investment of $2.6 billion. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 “Leasing” and Note 11 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Deferred income taxes, which is included in “Other liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2013, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 1,546,063 $ 49,650 $ 99,300 $ 99,300 $ 1,297,813 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 336 234 102 - - Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 1,843,100 240,040 429,833 332,437 840,790 Other obligations 2,400 600 1,200 600 - Self-insurance reserves (3) 122,866 54,191 34,424 18,042 16,209 Construction commitments 89,305 89,305 - - - Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,604,070 $ 434,020 $ 564,859 $ 450,379 $ 2,154,812 (1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $660 million and matures in September of 2016, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175%. As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 14 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2012, we recorded a liability of $59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities”. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into 38 any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $57 million and $60 million were outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See “Contractual Obligations” and Note 11 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. · Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. · Accounts Receivable – We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. · Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of 39 the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2012, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. · Vendor Concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. · Warranty Reserves – We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors. Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between vendor allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. · Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $11 million or 1.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. 40 · Closed Property Reserves – We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. · Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK and certain of CSK’s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. · Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2012 and 2011. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. 41 Fiscal 2012 First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 6.1 % 2.5 % 1.3 % 4.2 % Sales $ 1,529,392 $ 1,562,849 $ 1,601,558 $ 1,488,385 Gross profit 761,680 779,861 805,493 750,384 Operating income 247,501 243,603 263,318 222,971 Net income 147,492 146,120 159,332 132,802 Earnings per share – basic $ 1.16 $ 1.17 $ 1.34 $ 1.16 Earnings per share – assuming dilution $ 1.14 $ 1.15 $ 1.32 $ 1.14 Fiscal 2011 First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 5.7 % 4.4 % 4.8 % 3.3 % Sales $ 1,382,738 $ 1,479,318 $ 1,535,453 $ 1,391,307 Gross profit 669,781 718,661 754,210 694,697 Former CSK officer clawback - - - (2,798) Operating income 196,437 222,368 241,050 206,911 Write-off of debt issuance costs (21,626) - - - Termination of interest rate swap agreements (4,237) - - - Net income 102,474 133,772 148,439 122,988 Earnings per share – basic $ 0.73 $ 0.97 $ 1.12 $ 0.96 Earnings per share – assuming dilution $ 0.72 $ 0.96 $ 1.10 $ 0.94 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February of 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-02, ""Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"" ( “ASU 2013-02”). Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. We plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ended March 31, 2013; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of December 31, 2012, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.10 billion and $0.80 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.20 billion and $0.85 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $248 million. 42",2023-12-30 21:19:06.160314
898173,ORLY,O REILLY AUTOMOTIVE INC,2014,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including:•an overview of the key drivers of the automotive aftermarket industry;•key events and recent developments within our company;•our results of operations for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011;•our liquidity and capital resources;•any contractual obligations to which we are committed;•any off-balance sheet arrangements we utilize;•our critical accounting estimates;•the inflation and seasonality of our business;•our quarterly results for the years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012; and•recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our company.The review of Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements and risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report.

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy”. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good”, “better”, and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers: used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states.Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O’Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.24We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers’ willingness to return to “purchasing up” on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, since that time, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat. Although total miles driven have not significantly increased since 2007, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In addition, we believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment declines, total miles driven in the U.S. will return to a period of annual growth, supporting continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (“AAIA”), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 8% over the past decade, from 229 million light vehicles in 2002 to 247 million light vehicles in 2012. Annual new light vehicle registrations declined 14% over the past decade, from 16.7 million registrations in 2002 to 14.3 million registrations in 2012; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the “SAAR”) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2013, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed. In addition, during the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates remained relatively stable, ranging from just 4.6% to 5.7% annually. The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16%, from 9.6 years in 2002 to 11.1 years in 2012. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. However, as of December 31, 2013, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 6.7%, its lowest rate in over five years. We believe that as the economy continues to recover, unemployment rates should decline and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. The Company’s Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, which was announced on May 29, 2013, and an additional $500 million, which was announced on February 5, 2014, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $4.0 billion. These additional $500 million authorizations are effective for a three-year period following 25their respective announcement dates. As of February 28, 2014, we had repurchased approximately 40.6 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.4 billion under this program. •On June 20, 2013, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 (“3.850% Senior Notes due 2023”) at a price to the public of 99.992% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.•On July 2, 2013, the Company amended its credit agreement, which it entered into in January of 2011. The amendment lowered the maximum borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility to $600 million, extended the maturity date of the credit agreement to July of 2018 and lowered the interest rate margins on borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility and facility fees applicable to the commitments thereunder.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses49.3 49.9 51.0Gross profit50.7 50.1 49.0Selling, general and administrative expenses34.1 34.3 34.1Former CSK officer clawback— — (0.1)Operating income16.6 15.8 15.0Interest expense(0.7) (0.7) (0.5)Interest income— 0.1 0.1Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs— — (0.4)Termination of interest rate swap agreements— — (0.1)Income before income taxes15.9 15.2 14.1Provision for income taxes5.8 5.7 5.3Net income10.1 % 9.5 % 8.8 %2013 Compared to 2012Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $467 million to $6.65 billion from $6.18 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires & Service (""VIP"") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data. 26The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012Store sales: Comparable store sales$259Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2012, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales74Sales in 2012 for stores that have closed(3)Sales for stores opened throughout 2013 and acquired VIP stores134Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members3Total increase in sales$467We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, enhanced services and programs offered in most stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and commercial business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for commercial business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business. The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their existing vehicles. The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chainwide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is, on average, greater.We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 200 net, new stores in 2014.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs in the current year, the non-cash impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of our last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") reserve and the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of our total sales mix. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Distribution system efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. The decrease in capitalized distribution costs in the current year is the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in the prior year associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in the prior year were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs. The depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we have realized over time. The Company's policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are now effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost. We expect to incur pressure from product acquisition cost reductions in the first quarter of 2014; however, at this time, we do not anticipate material charges for the last three quarters of 2014. Unforeseen significant acquisition cost decreases could occur and may create additional LIFO gross margin headwinds during 2014. 27Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, outsized growth, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 24%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) from $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in our tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in the current year, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during the current year and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in the prior year.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $6.03 on 111 million shares from $4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year ago. 2012 Compared to 2011Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $393 million to $6.18 billion from $5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to the Same Period in 2011Store sales: Comparable store sales$215Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2011, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales78Sales in 2011 for stores that have closed(3)Sales for stores opened throughout 201296Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members7Total increase in sales$39328We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles. The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts. DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater.We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011. Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) from $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to DC efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs. This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) from $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The slight increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales. Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, decreased to $36 million (or 0.6% of sales), from $51 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30%. The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income.29Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales), from $508 million (or 8.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28% to $4.75 on 123 million shares from $3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events:Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O’Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This “clawback” amount was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 million ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “Other income (expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13% to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12% to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) from $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25% to $4.75 from $3.81 for the same period one year ago.

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information 30is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions): December 31, PercentageLiquidity and Related Ratios2013 2012 ChangeCurrent assets$2,835 $2,733 3.7 %Current liabilities2,423 2,273 6.6 %Working capital (1)412 460 (10.4)%Total debt1,396 1,096 27.4 %Total equity1,966 2,108 (6.7)%Debt to equity (2)0.71:1 0.52:1 36.5 % (1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current liabilities increased 7%, total debt increased 27% and total equity decreased 7% from 2012 to 2013. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6% as of December 31, 2013, as compared to 84.7% one year prior. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $300 million of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity2013 2012 2011Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$908,026 $1,251,555 $1,118,991Investing activities(388,754) (317,407) (319,653)Financing activities(536,082) (1,047,572) (467,507)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(16,810) $(113,424) $331,831 Capital expenditures$395,881 $300,719 $328,319Free cash flow (a)512,145 950,836 790,672(a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.Operating activities:The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year. Net inventory 31investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6%, 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new vendors added to our financing programs in the current year versus the prior year. We launched our enhanced vendor financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of vendors to the programs during 2011 and 2012. As we anniversary these vendor additions to the programs, we expect to see a slower rate of growth in our accounts payable to inventory ratio. The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7%, 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs. The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011. The increase in other current liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation.Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during the current year related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth. The total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year. Total capital expenditures were $301 million and $328 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened. We were able to find real estate with attractive lease rates during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior. Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location. We opened 190, 180, and 170 net, new stores in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012. We plan to open 200 net, new stores in 2014. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program.The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company’s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012. Credit facilities:On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"") for a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility"") arranged by Bank of America, N.A. and Barclays Capital, originally scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we completed our first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $660 million, extending the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In conjunction with the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In July of 2013, we completed our second amendment to the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $600 million, extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to July of 2018 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. We had outstanding stand-by letters of credit, primarily to support obligations 32related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $52 million and $57 million as of December 13, 2013 and 2012, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Credit Facility""), which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.Senior Notes:4.875% Senior Notes due 2021:On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.875% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021:On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.625% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022:On August 21, 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 (“3.800% Senior Notes due 2022”) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, which began on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023:On June 20, 2013, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 (“3.850% Senior Notes due 2023”) at a price to the public of 99.992% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries (“Subsidiary Guarantors”) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor’s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the subsidiary guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2013. Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”). Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, 33outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.98 times and 4.95 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.90 times and 1.83 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012GAAP net income$670,292 $585,746Add: Interest expense49,074 40,200Rent expense254,892 240,869Provision for income taxes388,650 355,775Depreciation expense183,220 176,705Amortization (benefit) expense(40) 401Non-cash share-based compensation21,722 22,026Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR)$1,567,810 $1,421,722 Interest expense$49,074 $40,200Capitalized interest10,644 6,064Rent expense254,892 240,869Total fixed charges$314,610 $287,133 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio4.98 4.95 GAAP debt$1,396,208 $1,095,956Stand-by letters of credit51,715 57,281Discount on senior notes3,890 4,366Six-times rent expense1,529,352 1,445,214Non-GAAP adjusted debt$2,981,165 $2,602,817 Consolidated leverage ratio1.90 1.83The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Share repurchase program:Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. During 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by $500 million, which is effective for a three-year period and 34expires May 29, 2016. As of December 31, 2013, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $3.5 billion. On February 5, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by an additional $500 million, which is effective for a three-year period and expires February 5, 2017. As of February 5, 2014, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $4.0 billion. The following table identifies shares of the Company’s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012Shares repurchased8,529 16,201Average price per share$109.38 $89.20Total investment$932,900 $1,445,044As of December 31, 2013, we had $146 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2014, we did not repurchase a material number of shares of our common stock. We repurchased a total of 41 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2014, at an average price of $82.61 for a total aggregate investment of $3.4 billion. As of February 28, 2014, we had approximately $645 million remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 “Leasing” and Note 13 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2014, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year Years1 and 2 Years3 and 4 Years 5 and Over (In thousands)Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1)$1,905,981 $61,200 $122,400 $122,400 $1,599,981Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2)103 77 26 — —Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2)1,941,490 247,126 445,887 355,336 893,141Other obligations1,800 600 1,200 — —Self-insurance reserves (3)126,715 57,700 38,292 17,805 12,918Construction commitments80,803 80,803 — — —Total contractual cash obligations$4,056,892 $447,506 $607,805 $495,541 $2,506,040(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July of 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.975% and our facility fee is 0.150%. As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.35(2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 16 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded a liability of $59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities”. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $52 million and $57 million were outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See “Contractual Obligations” and Note 13 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.•Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory 36balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. •Accounts Receivable – We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.•Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2013, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.•Vendor Concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.•Warranty Reserves – We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors. Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between vendor allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.37•Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $12 million or 1.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.•Closed Property Reserves – We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. •Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation (""CSK"") and certain of CSK’s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013.•Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able 38to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2013 and 2012.

Under ASU 2013-11, an entity is required to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. If a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2014; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.39Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates; however, as of December 31, 2013, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.40 billion and $1.10 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.41 billion and $1.20 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $231 million.40",2023-12-30 21:19:13.847542

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (""DIY"") customers and professional service providers – our ""dual market strategy."" Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects ""good,"" ""better,"" and ""best"" alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the ""best"" quality category of products. Consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2014, we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states.Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. During challenging macroeconomic conditions, we believe that the average consumer's tendency has been to ""trade down"" to lower quality products. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ""purchasing up"" on the value spectrum.23We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, between 2008 and 2013, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. remained relatively flat. As the U.S. economy began to recover in 2014, miles driven also improved and through November of 2014, year-to-date total miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.4%. We believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment continues to decline, total miles driven in the U.S. will continue to increase and return to the historical trend of long-term annual growth. In addition, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.•Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2003 to 2013, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 249 million by the end of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. was approximately 17 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. During the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from just 5.2% to 5.7% annually. The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16%, from 9.7 years in 2003 to 11.3 years in 2013. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment could impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. However, as of December 31, 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.6%, its lowest rate in over six years. We believe that as the economy continues to recover, total employment should increase and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•On January 26, 2015, Standard and Poor's Ratings Services raised all of its ratings on the Company, which moved the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility applicable rate to the tier one pricing level, thus reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins on borrowings of Eurodollar Rate loans.•Under the Company's share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion. Each additional $500 million authorization is each effective for a three-year period beginning on their respective announcement date. The authorizations under the share repurchase program that currently have capacity are scheduled to expire on August 13, 2017, and February 4, 242018. As of February 27, 2015, the Company had repurchased approximately 46.5 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion under this program. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses48.6 49.3 49.9Gross profit51.4 50.7 50.1Selling, general and administrative expenses33.8 34.1 34.3Operating income17.6 16.6 15.8Interest expense(0.7) (0.7) (0.7)Interest income— — 0.1Income before income taxes16.9 15.9 15.2Provision for income taxes6.1 5.8 5.7Net income10.8 % 10.1 % 9.5 %2014 Compared to 2013 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased $567 million to $7.22 billion from $6.65 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.0% and 4.3% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to the Same Period in 2013Store sales: Comparable store sales$389Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2013, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales90Sales in 2013 for stores that have closed(4)Sales for stores opened throughout 201485Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members7Total increase in sales$567We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvements in average ticket values were the result 25of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales, which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater. While the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts, both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores. The increases in DIY transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends.We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 190 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states compared to 4,166 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2013. We anticipate total new store growth to increase to 205 net, new store openings in 2015.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) from $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 10%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by the non-cash last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. During the third quarter of 2013, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $41 million to reflect replacement cost.Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) from $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $48 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $45 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) from $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was the result of higher taxable income in the current year, driven by our strong operating results. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increased benefits from employment tax credits in the current year.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $778 million (or 10.8% of sales), from $670 million (or 10.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 16%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased 22% to $7.34 on 106 million shares from $6.03 on 111 million shares for the same period one year ago. 262013 Compared to 2012 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $467 million to $6.65 billion from $6.18 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires & Service (""VIP"") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012Store sales: Comparable store sales$259Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2012, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales74Sales in 2012 for stores that have closed(3)Sales for stores opened throughout 2013 and acquired VIP stores134Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members3Total increase in sales$467We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provided incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for professional service provider business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business. The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The overall growth in the hard part categories continues to be driven by the increasing cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts are negatively impacted by these less frequent repairs. The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chain wide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts.We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012. Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, the non-cash negative impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of LIFO reserve and the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix. Acquisition cost improvements were the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage was driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through 27our distribution and store networks. Distribution system efficiencies were the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. The decrease in capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in 2012 associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in 2012 were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs. The complete depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we realized over time. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we began effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost in 2013. During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost in 2013. Professional service provider sales grew at a faster rate than DIY sales and professional service provider sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers; therefore, outsized growth in professional service provider sales, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales.Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 13%. Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 24%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) from $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in 2013, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during 2013 and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in 2012.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 14%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $6.03 on 111 million shares from $4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year prior. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. 28Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions): December 31,Percentage ChangeLiquidity and Related Ratios2014 2013Current assets$3,067 $2,8358.2 %Current liabilities2,831 2,42316.8 %Working capital (1)236 412(42.7)%Total debt1,397 1,3960.1 %Total equity$2,018 $1,9662.6 %Debt to equity (2)0.69:1 0.71:1(2.8)%(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current assets increased 8% and current liabilities increased 17% from 2013 to 2014. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 200 net, new stores. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% as of December 31, 2014, as compared to 86.6% in the prior year.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity2014 2013 2012Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities$1,190,430 $908,026 $1,251,555Investing activities(423,402) (388,754) (317,407)Financing activities(747,786) (536,082) (1,047,572)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$19,242 $(16,810) $(113,424) Capital expenditures$429,987 $395,881 $300,719Free cash flow (a)760,443 512,145 950,836(a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payroll-related liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs. Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6%, 86.6% and 84.7% as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2014 was driven by continued strong supplier support. The increase in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6%, 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new suppliers added to our financing programs versus the prior year. We launched our enhanced supplier financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of suppliers to the program during 2011 and 2012. The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013. 29Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2014 related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores as compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings. Total capital expenditures were $430 million and $396 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2013 related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings. Total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. We opened 200, 190, and 180 net, new stores in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012. We plan to open 205 net, new stores in 2015. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term senior notes during 2013, partially offset by the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year under our share repurchase program.The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during 2013 under our share repurchase program. Unsecured revolving credit facility:On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011, and as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013 (the ""Credit Agreement""). The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (""Revolving Credit Facility"") arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July of 2018. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. We had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $48 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Senior Notes:We have issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between 2021 and 2023 with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the unsecured senior notes of 3.800% to 4.875% is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's subsidiaries (""Subsidiary Guarantors"") that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2014. Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times from March 31, 2013, through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to 30earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense (""EBITDAR""). Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.36 times and 4.98 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.72 times and 1.90 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013GAAP net income$778,182 $670,292Add: Interest expense53,290 49,074Rent expense263,028 254,892Provision for income taxes444,000 388,650Depreciation expense193,418 183,220Amortization expense (benefit)787 (40)Non-cash share-based compensation23,095 21,722Non-GAAP EBITDAR$1,755,800 $1,567,810 Interest expense$53,290 $49,074Capitalized interest11,480 10,644Rent expense263,028 254,892Total fixed charges$327,798 $314,610 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio5.36 4.98 GAAP debt$1,396,640 $1,396,208Stand-by letters of credit47,861 51,715Discount on senior notes3,385 3,890Six-times rent expense1,578,168 1,529,352Non-GAAP adjusted debt$3,026,054 $2,981,165 Consolidated leverage ratio1.72 1.90Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Share repurchase program:Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and 31February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion. Each additional $500 million authorization is effective for a three-year period beginning on their respective announcement date.The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013Shares repurchased5,743 8,529Average price per share$150.86 $109.38Total investment$866,398 $932,900As of December 31, 2014, we had $279 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 27, 2015, we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $197.48, for a total investment of $28 million. We have repurchased a total of 46 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 27, 2015, at an average price of $91.38 for a total aggregate investment of $4.2 billion. As of February 27, 2015, we had approximately $752 million remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 ""Leasing,"" Note 9 ""Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans"" and Note 10 ""Commitments"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2015, which are included in ""Current liabilities"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 13 ""Income Taxes"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the realized deferred income taxes' ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded a net liability of $58 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of ""Other liabilities"".

Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our credit ratings at December 31, 2014, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.975% and our facility fee was 0.150%. As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings, our current margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.875% and our facility fee is 0.125% (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.(4) The projected obligation related to future payments under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the timing of which cannot be estimated. See Note 9 ""Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's compensation plans.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $48 million and $52 million were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See ""Contractual Obligations"" and Note 10 ""Commitments"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.•Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. 33We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2014, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014. •Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2014, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O'Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.•Supplier Concessions – We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers' financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.•Warranty Reserves – We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014.•Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider 34a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014, the financial impact would have been approximately $12 million or 1.0% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014.•Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O'Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation (""CSK"") and certain of CSK's former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014.•Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2014 and 2013. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.35 Fiscal 2014 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data)Comparable store sales6.3% 5.1% 6.2% 6.3%Sales$1,727,943 $1,847,088 $1,876,872 $1,764,178Gross profit877,716 950,877 968,201 912,107Operating income287,120 336,474 343,768 303,012Net income173,860 205,647 216,997 181,678Earnings per share – basic (1)$1.64 $1.94 $2.10 $1.79Earnings per share – assuming dilution (1)$1.61 $1.91 $2.06 $1.76 Fiscal 2013 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data)Comparable store sales0.6% 6.5% 4.6% 5.4%Sales$1,585,009 $1,714,969 $1,728,025 $1,621,234Gross profit798,663 871,875 879,163 819,300Operating income251,084 296,261 300,380 255,760Net income154,329 177,127 186,489 152,347Earnings per share – basic (1)$1.38 $1.61 $1.72 $1.43Earnings per share – assuming dilution (1)$1.36 $1.58 $1.69 $1.40(1) Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for each quarter and annual period.

Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption not permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017; we are in the process of evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In August of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, ""Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)"" (""ASU 2014-15""). ASU 2014-15 will require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosure in circumstances in which substantial doubt exists. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early application permitted. We will apply this guidance beginning with our annual period ending December 31, 2016; the application of this guidance affects disclosure only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility"") with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.36We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.40 billion and $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.53 billion and $1.41 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $251 million.37",2023-12-30 21:19:14.563348

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (""DIY"") customers and professional service providers – our ""dual market strategy."" Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects ""good,"" ""better,"" and ""best"" alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the ""best"" quality category of products. Consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as ""purchasing up"" on the value spectrum.23We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven – The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, between 2008 and 2013, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. remained relatively flat. In 2014, as the U.S. economy began to recover, miles driven also improved increasing 1.7%, and for 2015, miles driven increased 3.5%. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. We believe that as total employment continues to improve, total miles driven in the U.S. should continue to increase in line with the historical trend of long-term annual growth. •Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age – The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2004 to 2014, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 253 million by the end of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicles sales in the U.S. (""SAAR"") was approximately 17.2 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.6% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 21%, from 9.4 years in 2004 to 11.4 years in 2014. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment – Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6%, and as of December 31, 2015, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.0%, its lowest rate in over seven years. We believe, total employment should continue to increase, and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work further aiding the positive long-term trend of growth of total miles driven in the U.S. and demand for automotive aftermarket products. Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should continue to increase in line with the historical trend of long-term annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•Under the Company's share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 4, 2015, May 29, 2015, and February 10, 2016, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, $500 million and $750 million, respectively, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $6.25 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. As of February 26, 2016, we had repurchased approximately 52.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $5.56 billion under this program. 24RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses47.7 48.6 49.3Gross profit52.3 51.4 50.7Selling, general and administrative expenses33.2 33.8 34.1Operating income (1)19.0 17.6 16.6Interest expense(0.7) (0.7) (0.7)Interest income— — —Income before income taxes18.3 16.9 15.9Provision for income taxes6.6 6.1 5.8Net income11.7 % 10.8 % 10.1 %(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals. 2015 Compared to 2014 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $751 million to $7.97 billion from $7.22 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 10%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.5% and 6.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared to the Same Period in 2014Store sales: Comparable store sales$531Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2014, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales117Sales for stores opened throughout 2015102Sales in 2014 for stores that have closed(6)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members7Total increase in sales$751We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both our DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, and this improvement was without the benefit of an increase in the selling price of like kind items. 25These better engineered vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time, which does create pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are required, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater. Despite pressure from these better engineered vehicles requiring less frequent repairs, customer transaction counts increased for both our DIY and professional service provider customers for the year ended December 31, 2015. These increases in transaction counts were driven by an increase in miles driven and a corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, which was led by lower gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels. These factors created a positive macroeconomic environment, which was beneficial to both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts. In addition, the increase in our DIY transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends, and the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature stores. We opened 205 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 200 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states compared to 4,366 stores in 43 states at December 31, 2014. We anticipate total new store growth to increase to 210 net, new store openings in 2016.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) from $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 12%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, a smaller non-cash negative last-in, last-out (""LIFO"") impact and distribution system efficiencies. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale. The non-cash negative LIFO impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these acquisition cost reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $28 million and $41 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. Distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) from $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a $19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 19%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $54 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $48 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in the current period, as compared to the same period in the prior year.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) from $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 19%. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of higher taxable income in 2015, driven by our strong operating results. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the non-typical favorable tax reserve adjustment, which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition, partially offset by a decreased benefit in the current period from the realization of employment tax credits. Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $931 million (or 11.7% of sales), from $778 million (or 10.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 20%. 26Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased 25% to $9.17 on 102 million shares from $7.34 on 106 million shares for the same period one year ago. 2014 Compared to 2013 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased $567 million to $7.22 billion from $6.65 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.0% and 4.3% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to the Same Period in 2013Store sales: Comparable store sales$389Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2013, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales90Sales for stores opened throughout 201485Sales in 2013 for stores that have closed(4)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members7Total increase in sales$567We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales, which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater. While the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts, both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores. The increases in DIY transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends.We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 190 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states compared to 4,166 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2013. Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) from $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 10%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by the LIFO negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions. Acquisition cost improvements 27are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs. During the third quarter of 2013, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $41 million and $22 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost.Selling, general and administrative expenses:SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) from $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 15%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $48 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $45 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) from $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 14%. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, was the result of higher taxable income in 2014, driven by our strong operating results. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to increased benefits from the realization of employment tax credits in 2014.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased to $778 million (or 10.8% of sales), from $670 million (or 10.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 16%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased 22% to $7.34 on 106 million shares from $6.03 on 111 million shares for the same period one year prior. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. 28Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage ChangeLiquidity and Related Ratios 2015 2014 Current assets (1) $3,010 $3,065 (1.8)%Current liabilities (1) 3,046 2,813 8.3 %Working capital (1)(2) (36) 252 (114.3)%Total debt (1) 1,390 1,388 0.1 %Total equity $1,961 $2,018 (2.8)%Debt to equity (1)(3) 0.71:1 0.69:1 2.9 %(1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company's adoption of new accounting standards during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. See Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(3) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current liabilities increased 8% from 2014 to 2015. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 99.1% as of December 31, 2015, as compared to 94.6% in the prior year.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity 2015 2014 2013Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $1,281,476 $1,190,430 $908,026Investing activities (407,188) (423,402) (388,754)Financing activities (1,008,547) (747,786) (536,082)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(134,259) $19,242 $(16,810) Capital expenditures $414,020 $429,987 $395,881Free cash flow (1) 867,456 760,443 512,145(1) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities. The larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015, as compared to the end of 2014. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs. Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. The smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015, as compared to 2014. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2015, as compared to the increase in 2014, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates.The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payroll-related liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013. The greater decrease in our net inventory investment was the result of increased supplier participation and support of our supplier financing programs. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% and 86.6% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans. 29Investing activities:The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures were $414 million and $430 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth, partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015.The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures were $430 million and $396 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores opened in 2014, as compared to 2013, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings in 2014. We opened 205, 200, and 190 net, new stores in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We plan to open 210 net, new stores in 2016. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015.The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term senior notes during 2013, partially offset by a smaller impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2014. Unsecured revolving credit facility:On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011, and as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013, and further amended by Amendment No. 3 dated as of June 18, 2015 (the ""Credit Agreement""). The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility"") arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July 2018. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $38 million and $48 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Senior Notes:We have issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between January 2021 and June 2023 with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.800% to 4.875%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries (""Subsidiary Guarantors"") that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us, and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.30The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 times, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense (""EBITDAR""). Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.99 times and 5.36 times as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.52 times and 1.72 times as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014GAAP net income$931,216 $778,182Add: Interest expense57,129 53,290Rent expense273,259 263,028Provision for income taxes529,150 444,000Depreciation expense203,388 193,418Amortization expense6,868 787Non-cash share-based compensation21,899 23,095Non-GAAP EBITDAR$2,022,909 $1,755,800 Interest expense$57,129 $53,290Capitalized interest7,423 11,480Rent expense273,259 263,028Total fixed charges$337,811 $327,798 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio5.99 5.36 GAAP debt (1)$1,390,018 $1,388,422Add: Stand-by letters of credit37,536 47,861Discount on senior notes2,877 3,385Debt issuance costs7,105 8,218Six-times rent expense1,639,554 1,578,168Non-GAAP adjusted debt$3,077,090 $3,026,054 Consolidated leverage ratio1.52 1.72(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company's adoption of new accounting standards during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. See Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material 31limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 4, 2015, May 29, 2015, and February 10, 2016, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, $500 million and $750 million, respectively, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $6.25 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014Shares repurchased4,901 5,743Average price per share$231.81 $150.86Total investment$1,136,139 $866,398As of December 31, 2015, we had $143 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 26, 2016, we repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $247.61, for a total investment of $202 million. We have repurchased a total of 52 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 26, 2016, at an average price of $106.76 for a total aggregate investment of $5.56 billion. As of February 26, 2016, we had approximately $692 million remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 ""Leasing,"" Note 9 ""Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans"" and Note 10 ""Commitments"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2016, which are included in ""Current liabilities"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 ""Income Taxes"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a net liability of $44 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of ""Other liabilities."" We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 ""Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a liability of $17 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of ""Other liabilities.""32The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Payments Due By PeriodContractual Obligations Total Before 1 Year Years1 and 2 Years3 and 4 Years 5 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $1,783,581 $61,200 $122,400 $122,400 $1,477,581Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 2,132,524 259,815 483,758 398,658 990,293Other obligations 600 600 — — —Self-insurance reserves (3) 141,173 72,741 44,525 15,539 8,368Construction commitments 62,640 62,640 — — —Total contractual cash obligations $4,120,518 $456,996 $650,683 $536,597 $2,476,242(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.875% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.875% and our facility fee was 0.125%. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. See Note 6 ""Leasing"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 10 ""Commitments"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $38 million and $48 million were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See ""Contractual Obligations"" section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 ""Leasing"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.33•Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink: Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2015, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015. •Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2015, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O'Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.•Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers' financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.34•Warranty Reserves: We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015, the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015.•Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015, the financial impact would have been approximately $13 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015.•Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O'Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015, the financial impact would have been approximately $5 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2015.•Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able 35to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date"" (""ASU 2015-14""), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Originally, for public companies, ASU 2014-09 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including periods within that reporting period, and could be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption not permitted. For public companies, ASU 2015-14 changes ASU 2014-09 to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted retrospectively or as a cumulative effective adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption allowed, but not before ASU 2014-09's original effective date of December 15, 2016. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are in the process of 36evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which method of adoption is most appropriate for us.In January of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, ""Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)"" (""ASU 2015-01""). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items; such that, an entity will no longer need to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary. ASU 2015-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2016. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In April of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, ""Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)"" (""ASU 2015-03""). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, ""Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015, EITF Meeting"" (""ASU 2015-15""), to update ASU 2015-03 to reflect an SEC clarification. ASU 2015-15 allows an entity, in the case of a line-of-credit arrangement, to either follow ASU 2015-03 or defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratable over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including periods within that reporting period, requires retrospective application, and early adoption is permitted. We early-adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of December 31, 2015, and applied the requirements of the updates retrospectively. With the adoption of ASU 2015-15, we opted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to our Revolving Credit Facility as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratable over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of $7.1 million and $8.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our senior notes from ""Other current assets"" or ""Other assets, net"" to ""Long-term debt, less current portion"" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-15 resulted in the reclassification of $0.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Revolving Credit Facility from ""Other current assets"" to ""Other assets, net"" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Other than these reclassifications, the adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In November of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes"" (""ASU 2015-17""). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including periods within that reporting period, allows for prospective or retrospective application, and early adoption is permitted. We early-adopted ASU 2015-17 as of December 31, 2015, and applied the requirements of the update retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in the reclassification of $7.4 million and $17.3 million of deferred income tax liabilities from the current liability ""Deferred income taxes"" to other long-term liabilities ""Deferred income taxes"" within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"" (""ASU 2016-02""). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the future impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Item 7A.

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 4,829 stores in 47 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences, and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.25We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven – The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately 3 trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 2.8%, 3.5% and 1.7% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the U.S., supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age – The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2005 to 2015, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 258 million by the end of 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicles sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 18.3 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.4% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 22%, from 9.4 years in 2005 to 11.5 years in 2015. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment – Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2015, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.0%, and as of December 31, 2016, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 4.7%. We believe, total employment should remain at healthy levels with marginal improvements, and we would expect to see an increase in commuter traffic with a growing work force, further aiding the positive trend of growth of total miles driven in the U.S. and demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 10, 2016, May 27, 2016, and November 16, 2016, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $750 million, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $7.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. As of February 28, 2017, we had repurchased approximately 58.4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $7.25 billion under this program. •On March 8, 2016, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 (“3.550% Senior Notes due 2026”) at a price to the public of 99.832% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began with the first interest payment on September 15, 2016, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. •At the close of business on December 1, 2016, we completed an asset purchase of Bond Auto Parts (“Bond”), a large, privately held automotive parts supplier operating 48 stores throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York. 26RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses47.5 47.7 48.6Gross profit52.5 52.3 51.4Selling, general and administrative expenses32.7 33.2 33.8Operating income (1)19.8 19.0 17.6Interest expense(0.8) (0.7) (0.7)Interest income0.1 — —Income before income taxes19.1 18.3 16.9Provision for income taxes7.0 6.6 6.1Net income12.1 % 11.7 % 10.8 %(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals. 2016 Compared to 2015 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $626 million to $8.59 billion from $7.97 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.8% and 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Same Period in 2015Store sales: Comparable store sales$375Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2015, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales115Sales for stores opened throughout 2016 and sales from acquired Bond stores106Sales from Leap Day24Sales in 2015 for stores that have closed(4)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members10Total increase in sales$626We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from one additional day due to Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2016, sales from the acquired 48 Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.27Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. Customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, despite the added pressure from the better engineered, more technically advance vehicles requiring less frequent repairs. The increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven, and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, lower year-over-year gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels, creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment. The increase in our DIY customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, such as nights and weekends. The increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability.We opened 210 net, new stores and acquired 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to opening 205 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 4,829 stores in 47 states compared to 4,571 stores in 44 states at December 31, 2015. We anticipate new store growth will be 190 net, new store openings in 2017, slightly below the 2016 net, new store openings, due to the resources necessary to convert the acquired 48 Bond stores to our systems, inventory selection and décor packages during 2017.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) from $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from new stores and one additional day due to Leap Day. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by a larger non-cash last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) impact. Product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale. The non-cash LIFO impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $49 million and $28 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) from $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to Leap Day. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a $19 million litigation loss charge in the prior year, resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) from $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 12%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $62 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $54 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 16%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities. For additional information concerning our trading securities, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $600 million (36.6% effective tax rate) from $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the result of higher taxable income in 2016, primarily driven by our strong operating results, and higher effective tax rates. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily 28due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015, compared to 2016, and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales), from $931 million (or 11.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17% to $10.73 on 97 million shares from $9.17 on 102 million shares for the same period one year ago. 2015 Compared to 2014 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $751 million to $7.97 billion from $7.22 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 10%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.5% and 6.0% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Comparable store sales were calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2015, Compared to the Same Period in 2014Store sales: Comparable store sales$531Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2014, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales117Sales for stores opened throughout 2015102Sales in 2014 for stores that have closed(6)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members7Total increase in sales$751We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both our DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, and this improvement was without the benefit of an increase in the selling price of like kind items. These better engineered vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time, which does create pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are required, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater. Despite pressure from these better engineered vehicles requiring less frequent repairs, customer transaction counts increased for both our DIY and professional service provider customers for the year ended December 31, 2015. These increases in transaction counts were driven by an increase in miles driven and a corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, which was led by lower gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels. These factors created a positive macroeconomic environment, which was beneficial to both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts. In addition, the increase in our DIY transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends, and the increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature stores.29We opened 205 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 200 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 4,571 stores in 44 states compared to 4,366 stores in 43 states at December 31, 2014.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) from $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 12%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, a smaller non-cash negative LIFO impact and distribution system efficiencies. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale. The non-cash negative LIFO impact is the result of our continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these acquisition cost reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $28 million and $41 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. Distribution system efficiencies are the result of leverage on our increased sales volumes and lower fuel costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses:SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) from $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and a $19 million litigation loss charge from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 19%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $54 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $48 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 11%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) from $444 million (36.3% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 19%. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of higher taxable income in 2015, driven by our strong operating results. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the non-typical favorable tax reserve adjustment, which was related to historical tax positions due to a previous acquisition, partially offset by a decreased benefit in 2015 from the realization of employment tax credits.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $931 million (or 11.7% of sales), from $778 million (or 10.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 20%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased 25% to $9.17 on 102 million shares from $7.34 on 106 million shares for the same period one year prior.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit 30facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage ChangeLiquidity and Related Ratios 2016 2015 Current assets $3,258 $3,010 8.2 %Current liabilities 3,401 3,046 11.7 %Working capital (1) (143) (36) (297.2)%Total debt 1,887 1,390 35.8 %Total equity $1,627 $1,961 (17.0)%Debt to equity (2) 1.16:1 0.71:1 63.4 %(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current assets increased 8%, current liabilities increased 12%, total debt increased 36% and total equity decreased 17% from 2015 to 2016. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 210 net, new stores and acquiring 48 Bond stores in 2016. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our supplier financing program during the year. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7% as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 99.1% in the prior year. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $500 million of 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity 2016 2015 2014Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $1,454,167 $1,281,476 $1,190,430Investing activities (529,096) (407,188) (423,402)Financing activities (894,774) (1,008,547) (747,786)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $30,297 $(134,259) $19,242 Capital expenditures $476,344 $414,020 $429,987Free cash flow (1) 977,823 867,456 760,443(1) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period.Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7%, 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs. The decrease from income taxes payable in 2016, compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015, was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016, versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015.The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities. The larger increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of higher accrued income taxes payable at the end of 2015, as compared to the end of 2014. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs. The smaller decrease in net inventory investment in 2015 was the result of fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2015, as compared to 2014. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 99.1% and 94.6% 31as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2015, as compared to the increase in 2014, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates.Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016. Total capital expenditures were $476 million and $414 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016.The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures were $414 million and $430 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the construction of additional distribution facilities in 2014 to support our ongoing store growth, partially offset by an increase in the number of new store openings in 2015. We opened 210, 205, and 200 net, new stores in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and acquired 48 Bond stores in 2016. We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2017. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016.The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2015. Unsecured revolving credit facility:On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011, as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013, and as further amended by Amendment No. 3 dated as of June 18, 2015 (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July 2018. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $39 million and $38 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Senior Notes:On March 8, 2016, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 (“3.550% Senior Notes due 2026”) at a price to the public of 99.832% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began with the first interest payment on September 15, 2016, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.We have issued a cumulative $1.90 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between January 2021 and March 2026 with UMB as trustee. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries (“Subsidiary Guarantors”) that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us, and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor 32subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 times and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”). Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.15 times and 5.99 times as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.63 times and 1.52 times as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015GAAP net income$1,037,691 $931,216Add: Interest expense70,931 57,129Rent expense283,253 273,259Provision for income taxes599,500 529,150Depreciation expense217,009 203,388Amortization expense857 6,868Non-cash share-based compensation18,859 21,899Non-GAAP EBITDAR$2,228,100 $2,022,909 Interest expense$70,931 $57,129Capitalized interest7,933 7,423Rent expense283,253 273,259Total fixed charges$362,117 $337,811 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio6.15 5.99 GAAP debt $1,887,019 $1,390,018Add: Stand-by letters of credit38,680 37,536Discount on senior notes3,149 2,877Debt issuance costs9,832 7,105Six-times rent expense1,699,518 1,639,554Non-GAAP adjusted debt$3,638,198 $3,077,090 Consolidated leverage ratio1.63 1.5233Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 10, 2016, May 27, 2016, and November 16, 2016, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $750 million, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $7.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015Shares repurchased5,698 4,901Average price per share$264.21 $231.81Total investment$1,505,371 $1,136,139As of December 31, 2016, we had $888 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2017, we repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $267.32, for a total investment of $388 million. We have repurchased a total of 58 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2017, at an average price of $124.14 for a total aggregate investment of $7.25 billion. As of February 28, 2017, we had approximately $500 million remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 “Leasing,” Note 9 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” and Note 10 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2017, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a net liability of $41 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities.” We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This 34estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a liability of $20 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities.”The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands): Payments Due By PeriodContractual Obligations Total Before 1 Year Years1 and 2 Years3 and 4 Years 5 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $2,390,661 $78,950 $157,900 $945,713 $1,208,098Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 2,256,668 276,178 514,290 428,098 1,038,102Self-insurance reserves (3) 138,687 67,921 44,498 16,881 9,387Construction commitments 79,618 79,618 — — —Total contractual cash obligations $4,865,634 $502,667 $716,688 $1,390,692 $2,255,587(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.875% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.875% and our facility fee was 0.125%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. See Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 10 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $39 million and $38 million were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See “Contractual Obligations” section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these 35estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink:Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2016, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2016, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly’s stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.36Warranty Reserves:We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016, the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016.Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016, the financial impact would have been approximately $13 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016.Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016, the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2016.Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able 37to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU 2015-14”), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. For public companies, ASU 2015-14 changes ASU 2014-09 to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. These ASUs can be adopted retrospectively or as a cumulative-effective adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption allowed, but not before December 15, 2016. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, that is currently in the process of evaluating critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the preliminary work completed, we are considering the potential implications of the new standard on our recognition of customer related accounts receivable, warranty costs 38that are not the responsibility of our suppliers, the application of the Company’s retail O’Rewards loyalty program and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the new guidance. At this time, the task force has not completed its evaluation of the impact or means of adoption.In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, that is currently in the process of evaluating critical components this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the preliminary work completed, we are considering the potential implications of the new standard on determining the discount rate to be used in valuing new and existing leases, the treatment of existing favorable and unfavorable lease agreements acquired in connection with previous acquisitions, procedural and operational changes that may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the guidance and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the guidance, all of which are areas that could potentially be impacted by adoption of the guidance. At this time, the task force has not completed its full evaluation; however, we believe the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and total liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets.In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments” (“ASU 2016-06”). ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the debt hosts and requires entities to solely use the four-step decision sequence, which is already in existence, when assessing the embedded call or put options. For public companies, ASU 2016-06 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). Under ASU 2016-09, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, were simplified. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-09 includes various adoption methods, depending on the guidance being adopted; amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, while the amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows should be applied retrospectively, the amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement should be applied prospectively, and amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. We are in the process of evaluating the future impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as which method of adoption is most appropriate. At this time, we anticipate the adoption of the new guidance will prospectively impact our reported provision for income taxes, net income, weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution and earnings per share - assuming dilution, as well as retrospectively and prospectively impact our reported net cash provided by/used in operating activities and net cash provided by/used in financing activities.In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). Under ASU 2016-13, businesses and other organizations are required to present financial assets, measured at amortized costs basis, at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables. The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2020. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.39In August of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice for eight specific parts on cash flow statement presentation and classification: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies; distributions received from equity method investments; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (“ASU 2017-01”). ASU 2017-01 revises the definition of a business in the Accounting Standards Codification and clarifies the guidance for determining whether the purchase or disposal of an asset or group of assets qualifies as the purchase or disposal of a business. For public companies, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted with certain conditions. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing; instead the test is now a one-step process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. For public companies, ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption after January 1, 2017. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Item 7A.

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 5,019 stores in 47 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences, and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.25We believe the key drivers of current and future demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven – The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.2%, 2.4% and 3.5% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the U.S., supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age – The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 7% from 2006 to 2016, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 264 million by the end of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 17.8 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.3% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 22%, from 9.5 years in 2006 to 11.6 years in 2016. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment – Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2016, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7%, and as of December 31, 2017, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 4.1%. We believe total employment should remain at healthy levels supporting the trend of modest growth in total miles driven in the U.S. and the continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on May 10, 2017, September 1, 2017, and February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $10.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. As of February 28, 2018, we had repurchased approximately 67.4 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $9.32 billion under this program. •On April 5, 2017, we entered into a new credit agreement. The new credit agreement provided for a $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022.•On August 17, 2017, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 (“3.600% Senior Notes due 2027”) at a price to the public of 99.840% of their face value with UMB, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2018, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 26RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses47.4 47.5 47.7Gross profit52.6 52.5 52.3Selling, general and administrative expenses33.4 32.7 33.2Operating income (1)19.2 19.8 19.0Interest expense(1.0) (0.8) (0.7)Interest income— 0.1 —Income before income taxes18.2 19.1 18.3Provision for income taxes5.6 7.0 6.6Net income12.6 % 12.1 % 11.7 %(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals. 2017 Compared to 2016 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $385 million to $8.98 billion from $8.59 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 4%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.4% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Same Period in 2016Store sales: Comparable store sales, including sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores$182Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2016, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales126Sales for stores opened throughout 2017108Sales from Leap Day in 2016(25)Sales in 2016 for stores that have closed(5)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members(1)Total increase in sales$385We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, was driven by increases in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative customer transaction counts from both our DIY and 27professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. When repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values; however, the decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts. In addition, customer transaction counts for the year ended December 31, 2017, were negatively impacted by softer industry demand, resulting, in part, from the unseasonably mild winter weather at the onset of 2017 and a cool, wet summer in many of our markets. The mild winter weather did not stress vehicle components to the degree more typical harsh winter weather would, which resulted in a lower level of automobile parts breakage and associated demand for our products. The cool, wet summer in many of our markets resulted in a lower level of demand, as the absence of typical seasonally high temperatures resulted in fewer heat related product repairs. We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to opening 210 net, new stores and acquiring 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 5,019 stores in 47 states compared to 4,829 stores in 47 states at December 31, 2016. We anticipate new store growth will be 200 net, new store openings in 2018.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $4.72 billion (or 52.6% of sales) from $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily a result of sales from new stores, the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores, partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to Leap Day. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a smaller non-cash last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) impact, partially offset by a lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrinkage. The smaller LIFO impact is the result of fewer product acquisition cost improvements during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period one year ago. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our LIFO inventory costs were written down by approximately $22 million and $49 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. The lower merchandise margin was primarily the result of merchandise mix, driven by the unfavorable weather conditions during 2017. The higher inventory shrinkage was primarily cyclical in nature, following a period of lower than average shrinkage trends. Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $3.00 billion (or 33.4% of sales) from $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, partially offset by a $9.1 million benefit from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim and prior year incremental SG&A expenses incurred from one additional day due to Leap Day. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to deleverage of store operating costs on soft comparable store sales during the current period.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $1.73 billion (or 19.2% of sales) from $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 2%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $88 million (or 1.0% of sales), from $62 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 41%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased to $504 million (30.8% effective tax rate) from $600 million (36.6% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 16%. The decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, was the result of a one-time $53 million benefit to the provision for income taxes related to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate income tax rate set forth by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, and the adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”) in 2017, which provided a benefit of $49 million to the provision for income taxes. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, which provided a one-time benefit of 325 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, which provided a benefit of 297 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017.28Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $1.13 billion (or 12.6% of sales), from $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 18% to $12.67 on 90 million shares from $10.73 on 97 million shares for the same period one year ago. Due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a one-time benefit of $0.59. Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a benefit of $0.50. 2016 Compared to 2015 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased $626 million to $8.59 billion from $7.97 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.8% and 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016.The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Same Period in 2015Store sales: Comparable store sales$375Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2015, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales115Sales for stores opened throughout 2016 and sales from acquired Bond stores106Sales from Leap Day24Sales in 2015 for stores that have closed(4)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members10Total increase in sales$626We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from one additional day due to Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2016, sales from the acquired 48 Bond stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts from both our DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. Customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, despite the added pressure from the better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles requiring less frequent repairs. The increase in customer transaction counts was supported by an increase in miles driven, and the corresponding increase in vehicle maintenance, lower year-over-year gas prices and decreasing unemployment levels, creating an overall positive macroeconomic environment. The increase in our DIY customer transaction counts benefited from our continued focus on ensuring our stores are staffed with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, such as nights and weekends. The 29increase in our professional service provider customer transaction counts benefited from the continued growth of our less mature markets and our better parts and service availability.We opened 210 net, new stores and acquired 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to opening 205 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 4,829 stores in 47 states compared to 4,571 stores in 44 states at December 31, 2015. Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) from $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from new stores and one additional day due to Leap Day. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by a larger LIFO impact. Product acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs based on our increasing scale. The non-cash LIFO impact is the result of these continued product acquisition cost reductions, and due to these reductions, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve in 2013. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we were effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $49 million and $28 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses:SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) from $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 6%. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count and one additional day due to Leap Day. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on comparable store sales growth and a $19 million litigation loss charge in 2015, resulting from an adverse verdict in a contract dispute with a former service provider.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) from $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 12%.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $62 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $54 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 16%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities. Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $600 million (36.6% effective tax rate) from $529 million (36.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 13%. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016, was the result of higher taxable income in 2016, primarily driven by our strong operating results, and higher effective tax rates. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a larger amount of favorable resolutions of historical tax matters in 2015, compared to 2016, and a smaller benefit in 2016 from the realization of employment tax credits.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales), from $931 million (or 11.7% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 11%. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased 17% to $10.73 on 97 million shares from $9.17 on 102 million shares for the same period one year prior. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured 30revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage ChangeLiquidity and Related Ratios 2017 2016 Current assets $3,398 $3,258 4.3 %Current liabilities 3,647 3,401 7.2 %Working capital (1) (250) (143) (74.8)%Total debt 2,978 1,887 57.8 %Total equity $653 $1,627 (59.9)%Debt to equity (2) 4.56:1 1.16:1 293.1 %(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current assets increased 4%, current liabilities increased 7%, total debt increased 58% and total equity decreased 60% from 2016 to 2017. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 190 net, new stores in 2017. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 106.0% as of December 31, 2017, as compared to 105.7% in the prior year. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $750 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 and borrowings of $346 million on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on retained deficit and additional paid-in-capital, partially offset by a decrease in retained deficit from net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity: 2017 2016 2015Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities (1) $1,403,687 $1,510,713 $1,345,488Investing activities (464,223) (529,096) (407,188)Financing activities (1) (1,039,714) (951,320) (1,072,559)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(100,250) $30,297 $(134,259) Capital expenditures $465,940 $476,344 $414,020Free cash flow (2) 889,059 978,375 868,390(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.(2) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments for the period.Operating activities:The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in our net inventory investment, partially offset by an increase in net income. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 106.0%, 105.7% and 99.1% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2017 was primarily attributable to fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2017 and a smaller decrease in net inventory, due to a softer sales environment, as compared to 2016. 31The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a greater decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7%, 99.1% and 94.6% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2016 was primarily attributable to incrementally better terms from our suppliers and additional suppliers participating in our supplier financing programs. The decrease from income taxes payable in 2016, compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2015, was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2016, versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2015.Investing activities:The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in other investing activities and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2017. The decrease in other investing activities was primarily due to less acquisition related expenditures in 2017, as compared to 2016. Total capital expenditures were $466 million and $476 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings, construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2017, as compared to 2016.The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures and other investing activities in 2016. Total capital expenditures were $476 million and $414 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closing and construction costs for new stores and our distribution expansion projects during 2016, as compared to 2015. The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to small acquisitions during 2016.We opened 190, 210, and 205 net, new stores in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and acquired 48 Bond stores in 2016. We plan to open 200 net, new stores in 2018. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.6 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2017, as compared to 2016, partially offset by a higher level of net borrowings during 2017, as compared to 2016.The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2016, partially offset by a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2016, as compared to 2015. Unsecured revolving credit facility:On April 5, 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The new Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022. The new Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the new Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $600 million, provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $1.80 billion at any time.In conjunction with the closing of the new Credit Agreement, the Company’s previous credit agreement, which was originally entered into on January 14, 2011, as amended, was terminated (the “Terminated Credit Agreement”), and all outstanding loans and commitments, including the guarantees of each of the subsidiary guarantors, under the Terminated Credit Agreement were terminated and replaced by the loans and commitments under the new Credit Agreement. None of our subsidiaries are guarantors or obligors under the new Credit Agreement.As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $37 million and $39 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the new Credit Agreement by those amounts. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $346 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our terminated unsecured revolving credit facility.Senior Notes:On August 17, 2017, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.600% Senior Notes due 2027 (“3.600% Senior Notes due 2027”) at a price to the public of 99.840% of their face value with UMB Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 323.600% Senior Notes due 2027 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2018, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.We have issued a cumulative $2.65 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2021 and 2027, with UMB as trustee. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. None of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the Senior Notes.Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.72 times and 6.15 times as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.98 times and 1.51 times as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. 33The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016GAAP net income$1,133,804 $1,037,691Add: Interest expense91,349 70,931Rent expense298,614 283,253Provision for income taxes504,000 599,500Depreciation expense232,674 217,009Amortization expense1,171 857Non-cash share-based compensation19,401 18,859Non-GAAP EBITDAR$2,281,013 $2,228,100 Interest expense$91,349 $70,931Capitalized interest8,548 7,933Rent expense298,614 283,253Total fixed charges$398,511 $362,117 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio5.72 6.15 GAAP debt $2,978,390 $1,887,019Add: Stand-by letters of credit36,843 38,680Discount on senior notes3,721 3,149Debt issuance costs13,889 9,832Five-times rent expense1,493,070 1,416,265Non-GAAP adjusted debt$4,525,913 $3,354,945 Consolidated leverage ratio1.98 1.51The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Cash provided by operating activities (1)$1,403,687 $1,510,713 $1,345,488Less: Capital expenditures465,940 476,344 414,020Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation48,688 55,994 63,078Free cash flow$889,059 $978,375 $868,390(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.34Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on May 10, 2017, September 1, 2017, and February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $10.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016Shares repurchased9,301 5,698Average price per share$233.57 $264.21Total investment$2,172,437 $1,505,371As of December 31, 2017, we had $715 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2018, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $255.48, for a total investment of $290 million. We have repurchased a total of 67 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2018, at an average price of $138.38 for a total aggregate investment of $9.32 billion. As of February 28, 2018, we had approximately $1.43 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 “Leasing,” Note 9 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” and Note 10 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2018, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 12 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a net liability of $41 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.” We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 9 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a liability of $26 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”35The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Payments Due By PeriodContractual Obligations Total Before 1 Year Years1 and 2 Years3 and 4 Years 5 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $3,749,456 $123,845 $245,440 $1,628,581 $1,751,590Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 2,367,161 293,317 535,669 433,506 1,104,669Self-insurance reserves (3) 147,661 71,695 47,306 18,490 10,170Construction commitments 54,368 54,368 — — —Total contractual cash obligations $6,318,646 $543,225 $828,415 $2,080,577 $2,866,429(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Eurodollar Revolving Loans(both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Revolving Loan, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.9% and our facility fee was 0.100%. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings in the amount of $346 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. See Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 10 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $37 million and $39 million were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See “Contractual Obligations” section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.36Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink:Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2017, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or less than 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2017, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly’s stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.37Warranty Reserves:We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017, the financial impact would have been approximately $4 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017.Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017, the financial impact would have been approximately $14 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017.Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017.Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these 38increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU 2015-14”), to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. For public companies, ASU 2015-14 changes ASU 2014-09 to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. These ASUs can be adopted retrospectively or as a cumulative-effective adjustment at the date of adoption. We have substantially completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, and we will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. Results for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017, will be presented under ASU 2014-09, while prior period amounts will not be adjusted and will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods. Our primary source of revenue is derived from the sale of automotive aftermarket parts to our customers, and generally, our performance 39obligations are satisfied immediately when the parts are delivered to the customer, which normally occurs the same day the customer orders the part. As such, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; further, we do not expect significant changes to our business process, internal controls or systems as a result of adopting ASU 2014-09.In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. We have established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, which is currently in the process of evaluating critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the preliminary work completed, we are considering the potential implications of the new standard on determining the discount rate to be used in valuing new and existing leases, the treatment of existing favorable and unfavorable lease agreements acquired in connection with previous acquisitions, procedural and operational changes that may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the guidance and all applicable financial statement disclosures required by the guidance, all of which are areas that could potentially be impacted by adoption of the guidance. At this time, the task force has not completed its full evaluation; however, we believe the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and total liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets. In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). Under ASU 2016-09, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequence, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, were changed. We adopted this guidance with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur; this change was applied using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment of $0.3 million to opening “Retained earnings” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. We applied the amendments related to the presentation of tax withholdings on the statements of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $0.6 million and $0.9 million of tax withholdings being reclassified from “Net cash provided by operating activities” to “Net cash used in financing activities” on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We elected to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statements of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $56.0 million and $63.1 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation being reclassified from “Net cash used in financing activities” to “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. ASU 2016-09 amendments related to accounting for excess tax benefits in the income statement have been adopted prospectively, resulting in the reduction of $48.7 million in “Provision for income taxes” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017, which lowered our effective tax rate, increased dilutive shares outstanding and increased diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, by $0.50.In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). Under ASU 2016-13, businesses and other organizations are required to present financial assets, measured at amortized costs basis, at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables. The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2020. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In August of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)” (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice for eight specific parts on cash flow statement presentation and classification: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies; distributions received from equity method investments; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires retrospective 40adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business” (“ASU 2017-01”). ASU 2017-01 revises the definition of a business in the Accounting Standards Codification and clarifies the guidance for determining whether the purchase or disposal of an asset or group of assets qualifies as the purchase or disposal of a business. For public companies, ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted with certain conditions. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing; instead, the test is now a one-step process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. For public companies, ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption after January 1, 2017. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In May of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting” (“ASU 2017-09”). ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces both the diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying stock compensation guidance to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. For public companies, ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Item 7A.

As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $346 million, at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 2.675%. At this borrowing level, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $0.9 million.We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.65 billion and $1.90 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $2.73 billion and $1.98 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $46 million.41",2023-12-30 21:19:14.577773

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 5,219 stores in 47 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailorin25g our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences, and we also have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.We believe the key drivers of current and future demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment.•Number of Miles Driven – The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 0.3%, 1.2% and 2.4% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the U.S., supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age – The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 8.5% from 2007 to 2017, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 270 million by the end of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 17.5 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.2% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 21.9%, from 9.6 years in 2007 to 11.7 years in 2017. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. •Unemployment – Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment have historically impeded the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2017, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1%, and as of December 31, 2018, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 3.9%. We believe total employment should remain at healthy levels supporting the trend of modest growth in total miles driven in the U.S. and the continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service.KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:•Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 7, 2018, and November 13, 2018, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $11.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. As of February 27, 2019, we had repurchased approximately 73.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $11.02 billion under this program. •On May 17, 2018, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due 2028 (“4.350% Senior Notes due 2028”) at a price to the public of 99.732% of their face value with UMB Bank, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2028 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which began on December 1, 2018, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 26•After the close of business on December 31, 2018, we completed an asset purchase of Bennett Auto Supply, Inc. (“Bennett”), a privately held automotive parts supplier. The asset purchase included 33 stores that were not included in the Company’s 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018, and a warehouse located in southern Florida. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses47.2 47.4 47.5Gross profit 52.8 52.6 52.5Selling, general and administrative expenses33.8 33.4 32.7Operating income 19.0 19.2 19.8Interest expense(1.3) (1.0) (0.8)Interest income— — 0.1Income before income taxes (1)17.8 18.2 19.1Provision for income taxes3.9 5.6 7.0Net income13.9 % 12.6 % 12.1 %(1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals. 2018 Compared to 2017 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $559 million, or 6%, to $9.54 billion from $8.98 billion for the same period in 2017. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 1.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to the Same Period in 2017Store sales: Comparable store sales$336Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2017, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales101Sales for stores opened throughout 2018120Decline in sales for stores that have closed(7)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members9Total increase in sales$559We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broad selection of product offerings with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.27Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider customers and positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers, offset by negative transaction counts for DIY customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles and same SKU inflation. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. During the year ended December 31, 2018, DIY transaction counts also continued to be pressured by increased gas prices and other inflationary impacts, resulting in an increased deferral of vehicle maintenance and repairs over the short term. We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to opening 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 5,219 stores in 47 states compared to 5,019 stores in 47 states at December 31, 2017. After the close of business on December 31, 2018, we acquired the 33 Bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018. We anticipate new store growth will be 200 to 210 net, new store openings in 2019 and will net an additional 20 stores, as we will merge 13 of the acquired 33 Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly stores during 2019.Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 7% to $5.04 billion (or 52.8% of sales) from $4.72 billion (or 52.6% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a non-cash last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) charge in 2017, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to wage pressure and increased transportation costs, as compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not realize net acquisition cost decreases, and as a result, we did not record a LIFO charge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $22 million to reflect replacement cost.Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 8% to $3.22 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $3.00 billion (or 33.4% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, the planned allocation of a portion of the tax savings realized as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and unfavorable comparison to a 2017 benefit of $9.1 million from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to our tax savings allocation initiatives and the 2017 legal accrual benefit.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 5% to $1.82 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.73 billion (or 19.2% of sales) for the same period in 2017.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 38% to $121 million (or 1.3% of sales), from $88 million (or 1.0% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, decreased 27% to $370 million (21.8% effective tax rate) from $504 million (30.8% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2017. The decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018, were primarily the result of the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the Tax Act, partially offset by a $53 million benefit in 2017 from the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the Tax Act and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in 2018, as compared 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation were approximately $35 million and $49 million, respectively. Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 17% to $1.32 billion (or 13.9% of sales), from $1.13 billion (or 12.6% of sales) for the same period in 2017. 28Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 27% to $16.10 on 82 million shares from $12.67 on 90 million shares for the same period in 2017. Due to the revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities in 2017, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a one-time benefit of $0.59.2017 Compared to 2016 Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $385 million, or 4%, to $8.98 billion from $8.59 billion for the same period in 2016. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.4% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from Leap Day during the year ended December 31, 2016. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Same Period in 2016Store sales: Comparable store sales, including sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores$182Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2016, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales126Sales for stores opened throughout 2017108Sales from Leap Day in 2016(25)Decline in sales for stores that have closed(5)Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members(1)Total increase in sales$385We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, sales from the 48 acquired Bond Auto Parts (“Bond”) stores, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, was driven by increases in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative customer transaction counts from both our DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. When repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values; however, the decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts. In addition, customer transaction counts for the year ended December 31, 2017, were negatively impacted by softer industry demand, resulting, in part, from the unseasonably mild winter weather at the onset of 2017 and a cool, wet summer in many of our markets. The mild winter weather did not stress vehicle components to the degree more typical harsh winter weather would, which resulted in a lower level of automobile parts breakage and associated demand for our products. The cool, wet summer in many of our markets resulted in a lower level of demand, as the absence of typical seasonally high temperatures resulted in fewer heat related product repairs.We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to opening 210 net, new stores and acquiring 48 Bond stores during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 5,019 stores in 47 states compared to 4,829 stores in 47 states at December 31, 2016. 29Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 5% to $4.72 billion (or 52.6% of sales) from $4.51 billion (or 52.5% of sales) for the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily a result of sales from new stores, the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from the 48 acquired Bond stores, partially offset by gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to Leap Day for the same period one year prior. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a smaller non-cash LIFO impact, partially offset by a lower merchandise margin and higher inventory shrinkage. The smaller LIFO impact is the result of fewer product acquisition cost improvements during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared 2016. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our LIFO inventory costs were written down by approximately $22 million and $49 million, respectively, to reflect replacement cost. The lower merchandise margin was primarily the result of merchandise mix, driven by the unfavorable weather conditions during 2017. The higher inventory shrinkage was primarily cyclical in nature, following a period of lower than average shrinkage trends.Selling, general and administrative expenses:SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 7% to $3.00 billion (or 33.4% of sales) from $2.81 billion (or 32.7% of sales) for the same period in 2016. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, partially offset by a $9.1 million benefit from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim and incremental SG&A expenses incurred from one additional day due to Leap Day for the same period one year prior. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to deleverage of store operating costs on soft comparable store sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 2% to $1.73 billion (or 19.2% of sales) from $1.70 billion (or 19.8% of sales) for the same period in 2016.Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 41% to $88 million (or 1.0% of sales), from $62 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period in 2016. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs. Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 16% to $504 million (30.8% effective tax rate) from $600 million (36.6% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2016. The decrease in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017, was the result of a one-time $53 million benefit to the provision for income taxes related to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate income tax rate set forth by the Tax Act and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, which provided a benefit of $49 million to the provision for income taxes. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, which provided a one-time benefit of 325 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, which provided a benefit of 297 basis points to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017.Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 9% to $1.13 billion (or 12.6% of sales), from $1.04 billion (or 12.1% of sales) for the same period in 2016. Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 18% to $12.67 on 90 million shares from $10.73 on 97 million shares for the same period in 2016. Due to the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a one-time benefit of $0.59. Due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a benefit of $0.50. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the 30debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage ChangeLiquidity and Related Ratios 2018 2017 Current assets $3,543 $3,398 4.3 %Current liabilities 3,894 3,647 6.8 %Working capital (1) (351) (250) (40.4)%Total debt 3,417 2,978 14.7 %Total equity $354 $653 (45.8)%Debt to equity (2) 9.66:1 4.56:1 111.8 %(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.Current assets increased 4%, current liabilities increased 7%, total debt increased 15% and total equity decreased 46% from 2017 to 2018. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 200 net, new stores in 2018. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 105.7% as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 106.0% in the prior year. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $500 million of 4.350% Senior Notes due 2028 and borrowings of $287 million on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on retained deficit and additional paid-in-capital, partially offset by a decrease in retained deficit from net income for the year ended December 31, 2018.The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31,Liquidity: 2018 2017 2016Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities (1) $1,727,555 $1,403,687 $1,510,713Investing activities (534,302) (464,223) (529,096)Financing activities (1) (1,208,286) (1,039,714) (951,320)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(15,033) $(100,250) $30,297 Capital expenditures $504,268 $465,940 $476,344Free cash flow (2) 1,188,584 889,059 978,375(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.(2) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments for the period.Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased operating income, reduced cash taxes paid, due to the Tax Act, and a reduction of accounts receivable, due to the business day timing of year-end 2018, as compared to 2017.The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in our net inventory investment, partially offset by an increase in net income. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 106.0%, 105.7% and 99.1% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2017 31was primarily attributable to fewer new suppliers entering our supplier financing programs in 2017 and a smaller decrease in net inventory, due to a softer sales environment, as compared to 2016.Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and an increase in other investing activities. Total capital expenditures were $504 million and $466 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings, construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2018, as compared to 2017. The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to more acquisition related expenditures in 2018, as compared to 2017.The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in other investing activities and a decrease in capital expenditures in 2017. The decrease in other investing activities was primarily due to less acquisition related expenditures in 2017, as compared to 2016. Total capital expenditures were $466 million and $476 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the decrease was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings, construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2017, as compared to 2016.We opened 200, 190, and 210 net, new stores in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and acquired 48 Bond stores in 2016. After the close of business on December 31, 2018, we acquired the 33 Bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018. We plan to open 200 to 210 net, new stores in 2019. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.6 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to a lower level of net borrowings during 2018, as compared to 2017, partially offset by a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2018, as compared to 2017.The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to a greater impact from the repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program during 2017, as compared to 2016, partially offset by a higher level of net borrowings during 2017, as compared to 2016. Unsecured revolving credit facility:On April 5, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $600 million, provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $1.80 billion at any time.As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $35 million and $37 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement by those amounts. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amounts of $287 million and $346 million, respectively.Senior Notes:On May 17, 2018, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due 2028 (“4.350% Senior Notes due 2028”) at a price to the public of 99.732% of their face value with UMB Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 4.350% Senior Notes due 2028 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which began on December 1, 2018, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.The Company have issued a cumulative $3.15 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2021 and 2028, with UMB as trustee. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor under our senior notes.Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.32The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.38 times and 5.72 times as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 2.10 times and 1.98 times as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017GAAP net income$1,324,487 $1,133,804Add: Interest expense122,129 91,349Rent expense317,283 298,614Provision for income taxes369,600 504,000Depreciation expense255,866 232,674Amortization expense3,071 1,171Non-cash share-based compensation20,176 19,401Non-GAAP EBITDAR$2,412,612 $2,281,013 Interest expense$122,129 $91,349Capitalized interest9,092 8,548Rent expense317,283 298,614Total fixed charges$448,504 $398,511 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio5.38 5.72 GAAP debt $3,417,122 $2,978,390Add: Stand-by letters of credit35,148 36,843Discount on senior notes4,294 3,721Debt issuance costs15,584 13,889Five-times rent expense1,586,415 1,493,070Non-GAAP adjusted debt$5,058,563 $4,525,913 Consolidated leverage ratio2.10 1.9833The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Cash provided by operating activities (1)$1,727,555 $1,403,687 $1,510,713Less: Capital expenditures504,268 465,940 476,344Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation34,703 48,688 55,994Free cash flow$1,188,584 $889,059 $978,375(1) Prior period amount has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 7, 2018, and November 13, 2018, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $11.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017Shares repurchased6,061 9,301Average price per share$282.80 $233.57Total investment$1,713,953 $2,172,437As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.00 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 27, 2019, we repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $342.95, for a total investment of $269 million. We have repurchased a total of 73 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 27, 2019, at an average price of $150.73 for a total aggregate investment of $11.02 billion. As of February 27, 2019, we had approximately $0.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 “Leasing,” Note 10 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” and Note 11 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.34Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2019, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 13 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded a net liability of $39 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.” We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 10 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded a liability of $25 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Payments Due By PeriodContractual Obligations Total Before 1 Year Years1 and 2 Years3 and 4 Years 5 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $4,273,542 $141,414 $1,077,183 $1,056,936 $1,998,009Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 2,429,044 309,743 557,091 447,607 1,114,603Self-insurance reserves (3) 157,538 77,012 48,864 19,255 12,407Construction commitments 177,664 177,664 — — —Total contractual cash obligations $7,037,788 $705,833 $1,683,138 $1,523,798 $3,125,019(1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.900% and our facility fee was 0.100%. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings in the amount of $287 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. See Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 11 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10 years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub-limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term 35from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $35 million and $37 million were outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See “Contractual Obligations” section of Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K and Note 6 “Leasing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink:Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2018, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or less than 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2018. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2018, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly’s stock, which was a 36primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required.Supplier Concessions: We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.Warranty Reserves:We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2018, the financial impact would have been approximately $5 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2018.Self-Insurance Reserves: We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2018, the financial impact would have been approximately $15 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2018.Legal Reserves: We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2018, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2018.Taxes: We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax 37authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.QUARTERLY RESULTSThe following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Under Topic 606, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. Topic 606 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective transition method with our first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Results of the year ended December 31, 2018, were presented under Topic 606, while amounts in prior periods were not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standard in effect for the prior periods. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our business process, internal controls, systems, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; as such, a cumulative effective adjustment was not recorded to opening retained earnings.In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvement” (“ASU 2018-11”), to provide an additional, optional transition method for adopting ASU 2016-02, which allows for an entity to choose to apply the new lease standard at adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effective adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, while comparative periods presented will continue to be in accordance with current U.S. GAAP Topic 840. For public companies, Topic 842 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We established a task force, composed of multiple functional groups inside of the Company, which has substantially completed its objective of reviewing the critical components of the standard and implementing changes to systems and controls necessary to support the adoption of the new standard beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. We will adopt this guidance using the additional, optional transition method, the package of transitional practical expedients relating to the identification, classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before the effective date of Topic 842, and the transitional practical expedient for the treatment of existing land easements; however, we will not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient. We will make an accounting policy election to not apply recognition requirements of the guidance to short-term leases. The adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the total assets and liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheet, and we estimate net right-of-use assets and lease liability to be approximately $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The difference between these amounts is primarily due to the accrual for straight-line expense. These estimates are based on our current lease portfolio and changes to the lease portfolio, including the total number of leases, lease commencement and end dates and lease termination expectations, as well as changes in anticipated lease discount rates, could impact these estimates. We expect to make an adjustment to opening “Retained Deficit” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $1.4 million related to the adoption of this new guidance. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or our covenant compliance under our existing credit agreement. In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”). Under ASU 2016-09, several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequence, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, were changed. We adopted this guidance with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, the we elected to change our accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur; this change was applied using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment of $0.3 million to opening “Retained earnings” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. We applied the amendments related to the presentation of tax withholdings on the statement of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $0.6 million of tax withholdings being reclassified from “Net cash provided by operating activities” to “Net cash used in financing activities” on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. We elected to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using the retrospective transition method, which resulted in $56.0 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation being reclassified from “Net cash used in financing activities” to “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. ASU 2016-09 amendments related to accounting for excess tax benefits in the income statement were adopted prospectively, resulting in the reduction of $34.7 million and $48.7 million in “Provision for income taxes” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). Under ASU 2016-13, businesses and other organizations are required to present 39financial assets, measured at amortized costs basis, at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis, such as trade receivables. The measurement of expected credit loss will be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2020. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 eliminates the second step in the previous process for goodwill impairment testing; instead, the test is now a one-step process that calls for goodwill impairment loss to be measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. For public companies, ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires prospective adoption, with early adoption after January 1, 2017. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2019. The application of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In August of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”). ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within that reporting period, and allows for either retrospective or prospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this guidance with our third quarter ended September 30, 2018, using the prospective adoption method. We did not capitalize any implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts subsequent to adoption, and therefore, the adoption of this new guidance did not impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows during the period. We do not expect that the application of this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskUnless otherwise indicated, “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms, as well as references to the “Company” or “O’Reilly,” refer to O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries.We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $287 million, at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 4.560%. At this borrowing level, a 0.50% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $1.4 million.We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $3.15 billion and $2.65 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.12 billion and $2.73 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $31 million.40",2023-12-30 21:19:13.820435

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. ​Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.​Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 5,439 stores in 47 U.S. states and 21 stores in Mexico.​We are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that influence both our industry and our consumers, including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment trends, interest rates, and other economic factors. Due to the nature of these macroeconomic 24 ​factors, we are unable to determine how long current conditions will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business. ​The sustained trends of low U.S. unemployment have been favorable to our industry through the support of miles driven and consumer confidence; however, this has also resulted in pressure on wages, particularly when combined with legislated wage increases in certain market areas.​We believe the key drivers of current and future long-term demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age.​Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 0.4% and 1.2% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and through November of 2019, year-to-date miles driven increased 0.9%. We would expect to continue to see modest improvements in total miles driven in the U.S., supported by an increasing number of registered vehicles on the road, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.​Size and Age of the Vehicle FleetThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 8.1% from 2008 to 2018, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 272 million by the end of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 16.7 million, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.4% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 20.6%, from 9.7 years in 2008 to 11.7 years in 2018. ​We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.​We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. ​KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS​Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:●After the close of business on December 31, 2018, we completed an asset purchase of Bennett, a privately held automotive parts supplier operating 33 stores and a warehouse in Florida. These stores were not operated by the Company in 2018 and were therefore not included in our 2018 store count. Beginning January 1, 2019, the operations of the acquired Bennett locations were included in the Company’s store count, consolidated financial statements and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores.●Under the Company’s share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors in January of 2011, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on May 31, 2019, and February 5, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a resolution each time to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $13.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a 25 ​three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. As of February 28, 2020, we had repurchased approximately 77.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $12.54 billion under this program.●On May 20, 2019, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.900% Senior Notes due 2029 (“3.900% Senior Notes due 2029”) at a price to the public of 99.991% of their face value with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) as trustee. Interest on the 3.900% Senior Notes due 2029 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which began on December 1, 2019, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.●After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mayasa, a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts headquartered in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico pursuant to a stock purchase agreement. At the time of the acquisition, Mayasa operated six distribution centers, 21 Orma Autopartes stores and served over 2,000 independent jobber locations in 28 Mexican states. The results of Mayasa’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations related to the acquisition of Mayasa are not presented as Mayasa’s results are not material to the Company’s results of operations. ​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2019​2018​2017Sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% ​ 100.0%Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 46.9​ 47.2​ 47.4Gross profit 53.1​ 52.8​ 52.6Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.2​ 33.8​ 33.4Operating income 18.9​ 19.0​ 19.2Interest expense (1.4)​ (1.3)​ (1.0)Interest income 0.1​ —​ —Income before income taxes (1) 17.6​ 17.8​ 18.2Provision for income taxes 3.9​ 3.9​ 5.6Net income 13.7% ​ 13.9% ​ 12.6%(1)Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals.​2019 Compared to 2018​Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased $614 million, or 6%, to $10.15 billion from $9.54 billion for the same period in 2018. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.0% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. U.S. domestic comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.​26 ​The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in millions):​​​​​ Increase in Sales for the Year Ended ​​December 31, 2019​​Compared to the Same Period in 2018Store sales: ​ Comparable store sales​$ 375Non-comparable store sales:​ ​Sales for stores opened throughout 2018, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales​ 87Sales for stores opened throughout 2019 and sales from the acquired Bennett and Mayasa stores ​ 141Decline in sales for stores that have closed​ (8)Non-store sales:​ Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members​ 19Total increase in sales​$ 614​We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broad selection of product offerings in most of our stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.​Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2019, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider customers. Transaction counts were flat for the year ended December 31, 2019, comprised of positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers, offset by negative transaction counts for DIY customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the newer population of vehicles and increased selling prices on a same-SKU basis, as compared to one year ago. The increased complexity and replacement costs are a result of the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles that require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time, which creates pressure on customer transaction counts. However, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which benefits average ticket values. The increase in selling prices on a same-SKU basis was driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed through in market prices. Transaction counts for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, were also negatively impacted by wetter, cooler than normal temperatures in many of our markets during the first half of 2019, which is a headwind to DIY business. DIY transaction counts continue to be impacted by the inflationary environment.​We opened 200 net, new U.S. stores during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to opening 200 net, new U.S. stores during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, on January 1, 2019, we began operating 33 acquired Bennett stores, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, we merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we acquired 21 stores from Mayasa. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 5,439 stores in 47 U.S. states and 21 stores in Mexico compared to 5,219 U.S. stores in 47 states at December 31, 2018. We anticipate U.S. new store growth will be approximately 180 net, new store openings in 2020.​Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 7% to $5.39 billion (or 53.1% of sales) from $5.04 billion (or 52.8% of sales) for the same period in 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, was due to a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent industry-wide acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases. Beginning in the last six months of 2018, inventory acquisition costs in our industry increased, as a result of tariffs on products imported from China and other increases in supplier input costs, which were passed through in higher retail and wholesale prices in our industry. We determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, but have, over time, seen our LIFO reserve balance exhausted, as a result of cumulative historical acquisition cost decreases. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.​27 ​Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 8% to $3.47 billion (or 34.2% of sales) from $3.22 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period in 2018. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2019, was the result of Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, was principally due to wage pressure, driven by a low unemployment, inflationary environment, and other variable costs, including health benefit costs and cost of insurance, primarily auto related, and increased spending on Omnichannel and technology initiatives.​Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 6% to $1.92 billion (or 18.9% of sales) from $1.82 billion (or 19.0% of sales) for the same period in 2018.​Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 8% to $130 million (or 1.3% of sales), from $121 million (or 1.3% of sales) for the same period in 2018. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by an increase in the value of our trading securities.​Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 8% to $399 million (22.3% effective tax rate) from $370 million (21.8% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2018. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, was the result of lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation were approximately $26 million and $35 million, respectively.​Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 5% to $1.39 billion (or 13.7% of sales), from $1.32 billion (or 13.9% of sales) for the same period in 2018.​Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 11% to $17.88 on 78 million shares from $16.10 on 82 million shares for the same period in 2018. ​2018 Compared to 2017​Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased $559 million, or 6%, to $9.54 billion from $8.98 billion for the same period in 2017. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 1.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.​28 ​The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions):​​​​​ Increase in Sales for the Year Ended ​​December 31, 2018,​​Compared to the Same Period in 2017Store sales: ​ Comparable store sales​$ 336Non-comparable store sales:​ Sales for stores opened throughout 2017, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales​ 101Sales for stores opened throughout 2018​ 120Decline in sales for stores that have closed​ (7)Non-store sales:​ Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members​ 9Total increase in sales​$ 559​We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broad selection of product offerings with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers.​Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider customers and positive transaction counts for professional service provider customers, offset by negative transaction counts for DIY customers. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles and same SKU inflation. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. During the year ended December 31, 2018, DIY transaction counts also continued to be pressured by increased gas prices and other inflationary impacts, resulting in an increased deferral of vehicle maintenance and repairs over the short term.​We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to opening 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 5,219 stores in 47 states compared to 5,019 stores in 47 states at December 31, 2017. After the close of business on December 31, 2018, we acquired the 33 Bennett stores that were not included in our 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018. ​Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 7% to $5.04 billion (or 52.8% of sales) from $4.72 billion (or 52.6% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to a non-cash LIFO charge in 2017, partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to wage pressure and increased transportation costs, as compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not realize net acquisition cost decreases, and as a result, we did not record a LIFO charge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our LIFO costs were written down by approximately $22 million to reflect replacement cost.​Selling, general and administrative expenses:SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 8% to $3.22 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $3.00 billion (or 33.4% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, the planned allocation of a portion of the tax savings realized as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”) and unfavorable comparison to a 2017 benefit of $9.1 million from the reduction in our legal accrual following the expiration of the statute of limitations related to a legacy claim. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to our tax savings allocation initiatives and the 2017 legal accrual benefit.​29 ​Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 5% to $1.82 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.73 billion (or 19.2% of sales) for the same period in 2017.​Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 38% to $121 million (or 1.3% of sales), from $88 million (or 1.0% of sales) for the same period in 2017. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings.​Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, decreased 27% to $370 million (21.8% effective tax rate) from $504 million (30.8% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2017. The decreases in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018, were primarily the result of the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the Tax Act, partially offset by a $53 million benefit in 2017 from the required revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower federal corporate tax rate set forth by the Tax Act and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in 2018, as compared 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation were approximately $35 million and $49 million, respectively.​Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 17% to $1.32 billion (or 13.9% of sales), from $1.13 billion (or 12.6% of sales) for the same period in 2017.​Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased 27% to $16.10 on 82 million shares from $12.67 on 90 million shares for the same period in 2017. Due to the revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities in 2017, our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, included a one-time benefit of $0.59. ​LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES​Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels.​Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​December 31, ​PercentageLiquidity and Related Ratios 2019 2018​ChangeCurrent assets​$ 3,834​$ 3,543 8.2%Current liabilities​ 4,469​ 3,894 14.8%Working capital (1)​ (636)​ (351) (81.2)%Total debt​ 3,891​ 3,417 13.9%Total equity​$ 397​$ 354 12.3%Debt to equity (2)​ 9.79:1​ 9.66:1 1.3%(1)Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2)Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.​Current assets increased 8%, current liabilities increased 15%, total debt increased 14% and total equity increased 12% from 2018 to 2019. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from our distribution expansion projects and the opening and acquiring of 241 net, new stores in 2019. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the adoption of 30 ​ASC 842 during 2019, resulting in the recognition of $316 million of current operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2019, and an increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to distribution expansion projects and new store openings. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 104.4% as of December 31, 2019, as compared to 105.7% for the same period in 2018. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $500 million of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2029 and borrowings of $261 million on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2019. The increase in total equity was due to a decrease in retained deficit, resulting from net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased additional paid-in-capital, which was due to employee stock option exercises, partially offset by the impact of share repurchase activity, under our share repurchase program, on retained deficit and additional paid-in capital. ​The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, Liquidity: 2019 2018 2017Total cash provided by/(used in): ​ ​ ​ Operating activities​$ 1,708,479​$ 1,727,555​$ 1,403,687Investing activities​ (796,746)​ (534,302)​ (464,223)Financing activities​ (902,811)​ (1,208,286)​ (1,039,714)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash​​ 169​​ —​​ —Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents​$ 9,091​$ (15,033)​$ (100,250)​​​​​​​​​​Capital expenditures​$ 628,057​$ 504,268​$ 465,940Free cash flow (1)​​ 1,020,649​​ 1,188,584​ 889,059(1)Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments, and investment in tax credit equity investments for the period.​Cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the U.S. were $5.7 million as of December 31, 2019, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in Mexico, and no cash or cash equivalents were held outside of the U.S. as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.​Operating activities:The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in income taxes payable, a larger increase in net inventory investment and an increase in accounts receivable, primarily offset by increased operating income. The decrease from income taxes payable in 2019, compared to the increase in income taxes payable in 2018, was primarily the result of a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2019, versus an income taxes payable position at the end of 2018. The increase in net inventory investment was the result of a larger increase in inventory in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily driven by our distribution expansion projects. The increase in accounts receivable during 2019, as compared to the decrease in 2018, was primarily due to the respective year-over-year business day timing of year-end.​The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased operating income, reduced cash taxes paid, due to the Tax Act, and a reduction of accounts receivable, due to the business day timing of year-end 2018, as compared to 2017.​Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures, investments in tax credit equity investments and an increase in other investing activities. Total capital expenditures were $628 million in 2019 versus $504 million in 2018, and the increase was primarily related to distribution expansion projects, the timing of property acquisitions and construction costs for new stores and technology investments during 2019, as compared to 2018. Investments in tax credit equity investments were the result of entering into tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. The increase in other investing activities was due to the acquisition of Mayasa in 2019. ​The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and an increase in other investing activities. Total capital expenditures were $504 million and $466 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the increase was primarily related to the timing of property acquisitions, closings, construction costs for new stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores opened during 2018, as compared to 2017. The increase in other investing activities was primarily due to more acquisition related expenditures in 2018, as compared to 2017.​31 ​We opened 200, 200, and 190 net, new domestic stores in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, on January 1, 2019, we began operating 33 acquired Bennett stores, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, we merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we acquired 21 stores from Mayasa. We plan to open approximately 180 net, new domestic stores in 2020. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.​Financing activities:The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2019, compared to 2018, and a higher level of net borrowings during 2019, as compared to 2018.​The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to a lower level of net borrowings during 2018, as compared to 2017, partially offset by a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2018, as compared to 2017.​Unsecured revolving credit facility:On April 5, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $600 million, provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $1.80 billion at any time.​As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $39 million and $35 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement by those amounts. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in the amounts of $261 million and $287 million, respectively.​Senior Notes:On May 20, 2019, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.900% Senior Notes due 2029 (“3.900% Senior Notes due 2029”) at a price to the public of 99.991% of their face value with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) as trustee. Interest on the 3.900% Senior Notes due 2029 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, which began on December 1, 2019, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.​We have issued a cumulative $3.65 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2021 and 2029, with UMB Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank as trustees. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 3.550% to 4.875%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor under our senior notes.​Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.​The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.​32 ​We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.21 times and 5.38 times as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 2.20 times and 2.10 times as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. ​The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended​​​December 31, ​​ 2019 2018GAAP net income​$ 1,391,042​$ 1,324,487Add:Interest expense​ 139,975​ 122,129​Rent expense (1)​ 338,697​ 317,283​Provision for income taxes​ 399,287​ 369,600​Depreciation expense​ 270,076​ 255,866​Amortization expense​ 799​ 3,071​Non-cash share-based compensation​ 21,921​ 20,176Non-GAAP EBITDAR​$ 2,561,797​$ 2,412,612​​​​​​​​Interest expense​$ 139,975​$ 122,129​Capitalized interest​ 12,998​ 9,092​Rent expense (1)​ 338,697​ 317,283Total fixed charges​$ 491,670​$ 448,504​​​​​​​​Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio​ 5.21​ 5.38​​​​​​​​GAAP debt​$ 3,890,527​$ 3,417,122Add:Stand-by letters of credit​ 38,870​ 35,148​Discount on senior notes​ 3,515​ 4,294​Debt issuance costs​ 16,958​ 15,584​Five-times rent expense​ 1,693,485​ 1,586,415Non-GAAP adjusted debt​$ 5,643,355​$ 5,058,563​​​​​​​​Consolidated leverage ratio​ 2.20​ 2.10(1)The table below outlines the calculation of Rent expense and reconciles Rent expense to Total lease cost, per Accounting Standard Codification 842 (“ASC 842”), adopted and effective January 1, 2019, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2019 $ 398,294Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2019​ 59,597Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2019​$ 338,697​The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by operating activities ​$ 1,708,479​$ 1,727,555​$ 1,403,687Less:Capital expenditures​ 628,057​ 504,268​ 465,940​Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments​ 25,992​ 34,703​ 48,688​Investment in tax credit equity investments​ 33,781​ —​ —Free cash flow​$ 1,020,649​$ 1,188,584​$ 889,059​33 ​Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.​Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on May 31, 2019, and February 5, 2020, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.00 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $13.75 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.​The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except per share data):​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2019 2018Shares repurchased ​ 3,877 ​ 6,061Average price per share​$ 369.55​$ 282.80Total investment​$ 1,432,752​$ 1,713,953​As of December 31, 2019, we had $569 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2020, we repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $400.78, for a total investment of $363 million. We have repurchased a total of 77.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2020, at an average price of $162.72 for a total aggregate investment of $12.54 billion. As of February 28, 2020, we had approximately $1.21 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. ​CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS​Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 “Leases,” Note 11 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” and Note 13 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.​Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2020, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.​We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2019, we recorded a net liability of $36.6 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”​We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 11 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of 34 ​December 31, 2019, we recorded a liability of $32 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”​The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments Due By Period​​​​Before​Years ​Years ​Years 5Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 and 2 3 and 4 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1)​$ 4,779,438​$ 157,958​$ 1,624,882​$ 477,935​$ 2,518,663Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2)​ 2,437,219​ 316,050​ 574,102​ 456,857​ 1,090,210Self-insurance reserves (3)​ 168,279​ 79,079​ 54,148​ 21,772​ 13,280Construction commitments​ 100,086​ 100,086​ —​ —​ —Capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments (4)​​ 95,000​​ 95,000​​ —​​ —​​ —Total contractual cash obligations​$ 7,580,022​$ 748,173​$ 2,253,132​$ 956,564​$ 3,622,153(1)Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.900% and our facility fee was 0.100%. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings in the amount of $261 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.(2)The minimum lease payments above do not include potential amounts for percentage rent and other variable operating lease related costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. See Note 5 “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3)We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 13 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.(4)We have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. We are required to make capital contributions upon achievement of project milestones by the solar energy farms, the timing of which is variable and outside of the Company’s control. See Note 13 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our capital contribution obligations. ​OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS​Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10 years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.​We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub-limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $39 million and $35 million were outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.​We have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. We are required to make capital contributions totaling $95 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar energy farms, the timing of which is variable and outside of the Company’s control. ​We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ​35 ​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.​Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink:Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of products is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future.​We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2019, the financial impact would have been approximately less than $1 million or less than 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2019.​Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill:We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment.​We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves a detailed qualitative assessment to be performed first and then, based on the conclusion of the totality of events and circumstances, a quantitative assessment may be performed, which involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. When a quantitative assessment is performed, inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates that incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. Based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2019, nor do we believe goodwill would be at risk of failing impairment testing. ​Supplier Concessions:We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are 36 ​incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.​Warranty Reserves:We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2019, the financial impact would have been approximately $6 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2019.​Self-Insurance Reserves:We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2019, the financial impact would have been approximately $16 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2019.​Legal Reserves:We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation, for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2019, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or less than 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2019.​Taxes:We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax 37 ​positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results, except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. ​INFLATION AND SEASONALITY​We have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.​To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. ​QUARTERLY RESULTS​The following tables set forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk​Interest rate risk:We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $261 million, at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 3.318%. At this borrowing level, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $0.7 million.​We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $3.65 billion and $3.15 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.88 billion and $3.12 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.​Cash equivalents risk:We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $40 million.​Foreign currency risk:Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.​We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $151.9 million at December 31, 2019. The year-end exchange rates of the Mexican peso with respect to the U.S. dollar increased by approximately 3% from the acquisition date of November 29, 2019. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2019, would be approximately $13.8 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. ​A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations. ​​39 ​",2023-12-30 21:19:10.731358

We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. ​Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.​Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; and professional paint shop mixing and related materials. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 5,594 stores in 47 U.S. states and 22 stores in Mexico.​We are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and our consumers, including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. Due to the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we are unable to determine how long current conditions will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business. Macroeconomic factors, such as increases in the U.S. unemployment rate, and demand drivers specific to the automotive aftermarket, such as U.S. miles driven, have been pressured as a result of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as stay at home orders, work from home arrangements and reduced travel. Gradual reopening processes across many markets positively impacted our performance beginning in the second quarter and continuing into our third and fourth quarters; however, we are unable to predict the ongoing and future impact of the pandemic on broader economic conditions or our industry.​We believe the key drivers of current and future long-term demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age.​Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 0.9% and 0.4% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and through February of 2020, year-to-date miles driven increased 2.1%. Miles driven dramatically declined beginning in March of 2020, and through December 2020, year-to-date miles driven decreased 13.2%, as a result of the measures taken by state and local 26 ​governments in response to COVID-19 and the impact to economic activity as consumers responded to COVID-19. Further government measures or consumer and business behavior could continue to have a negative impact on miles driven, but we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the impact to our business.​Size and Age of the Vehicle FleetThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 10.4% from 2009 to 2019, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 278 million by the end of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 16.3 million. In the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 18.0%, from 10.0 years in 2009 to 11.8 years in 2019.​We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.​We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. ​KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS​Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below:​After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mayasa, a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts headquartered in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico pursuant to a stock purchase agreement. At the time of the acquisition, Mayasa operated six distribution centers, 21 Orma Autopartes stores and served over 2,000 independent jobber locations in 28 Mexican states. The results of Mayasa’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning from the date of acquisition. ​The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the economy, placing pressure on our business beginning in mid-March 2020, as stay at home orders and/or business restrictions were put in place in most cities, counties and states. This pressure continued until mid-April when our customers began to receive Economic Impact Payments under the CARES Act. We believe these government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, along with the easing of stay at home orders and the associated market reopenings beginning in May and June and favorable industry dynamics, such as consumers investing in existing vehicles, led to strong demand for our products beginning in April and continuing through the remainder of 2020. ​We have been deemed an essential service provider in the communities we serve, and have taken many steps to promote the health and safety of our customers and Team Members, while keeping our stores open and operating to meet our customers’ critical needs during the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, when our business was pressured at the end of the first quarter, we took steps to strengthen our liquidity and mitigate the expected ongoing impact on our operations and financial performance.​These actions include, but are not limited to:●Implementing social distancing standards throughout the Company, providing our Team Members with personal protective equipment and modifying store procedures, including the implementation of curbside pickup for Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store orders, enhanced cleaning protocols, health screening, contact tracing and mandatory masking for all Team Members;●Putting in place programs to relax attendance policies, as well as advance sick time to assist Team Members who are place in quarantine or need time away to support family members effective by COVID-19;●Temporarily deferring certain capital investments, many of which have now resumed, and prudently managing our cost structure in response to sales volatility;27 ​●Successfully issuing $500 million aggregate principal amount unsecured 4.20% Senior Notes due 2030, and drawing a precautionary $250 million on our existing revolving credit facility, however during the second quarter of 2020, this additional draw was repaid;●Temporarily suspending our share repurchase program on March 16, 2020, however, the program resumed on May 29, 2020, based on the improved business environment and outlook; and●Utilizing relief efforts as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) signed into law on March 27, 2020, which included bonus depreciation on eligible property, deferral of employer portion of social security taxes and deferral of certain tax payments.​While we continue to make adjustments as we navigate the current environment, we are unable to predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of the impact on our customers and our business. ​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales, which is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals due to rounding differences, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2020​2019Sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 47.6​​ 46.9 Gross profit 52.4​​ 53.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 31.6​​ 34.2 Operating income 20.8 ​ 18.9 Interest expense (1.4)​​ (1.4) Interest income 0.1​​ 0.1 Income before income taxes 19.5​​ 17.6​Provision for income taxes 4.4​​ 3.9 Net income 15.1% ​ 13.7% ​2020 Compared to 2019​Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased $1.45 billion, or 14%, to $11.60 billion from $10.15 billion for the same period in 2019. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 10.9% and 4.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for U.S. domestic stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day in the year ended December 31, 2020. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.​28 ​The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in millions):​​​​​ Increase in Sales for the Year Ended ​​December 31, 2020,​​Compared to the Same Period in 2019Store sales: ​ Comparable store sales​$ 1,082Non-comparable store sales:​ ​Sales for stores opened throughout 2019, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales, and sales from the acquired Mayasa stores​ 120Sales for stores opened throughout 2020​ 123Sales from Leap Day​​ 34Decline in sales for stores that have closed​ (9)Non-store sales:​ Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members​ 105Total increase in sales​$ 1,455​We believe the increased sales are the result of store growth, the acquisition of Mayasa, sales from one additional day due to Leap Day for the year ended December 31, 2020, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. The Company incurred significant sales headwinds beginning in the middle of March and through the middle of April, as a result of COVID-19; however, the government stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, easing of stay at home orders and the associated market reopenings beginning in May and June, when combined with favorable industry dynamics, such as consumers investing in existing vehicles, led to strong demand for our products over the remainder of the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of 2020.​Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2020, was driven by increases in average ticket and transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers. Beginning in April of 2020, average ticket values, primarily for DIY customers, benefited from consumers spending additional time and money repairing and maintaining their vehicles in response to the COVID-19 and economic environment. In addition, the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. This decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. Average ticket values also benefited from increased selling prices on a SKU-by-SKU basis, as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by increases in acquisition cost of inventory, which were passed on in market prices. ​As the COVID-19 stay at home orders and business restrictions took effect in our markets in the middle of March 2020, transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers turned sharply negative, with a larger impact realized on the professional side of the business, as we believe a larger segment of the demographic served by our professional service provider customers is more likely to accommodate working from home than a typical DIY customer. However, in the middle of April 2020, as the government stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits reached consumers, we saw a reversal in transaction counts, with a more immediate impact realized on the DIY side of the business. Improved transaction counts continued through December 2020, as states implemented reopening plans and many individuals returned to work. We cannot predict what continued impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have to our business in the future given the high degree of uncertainty as to the duration and severity of the pandemic, the potential future changes to economic reopening plans and the mitigating impact of government stimulus for consumers.​We opened 155 net, new U.S. stores and one new store in Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to opening 200 net, new U.S. stores during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, on January 1, 2019, we began operating 33 acquired Bennett stores, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, we merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we acquired 21 stores from Mayasa. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 5,594 stores in 47 U.S. states and 22 stores in Mexico compared to 5,439 U.S. stores in 47 states and 21 stores in Mexico at December 31, 2019. We anticipate new store growth will be 165 to 175 net, new store openings in 2021.29 ​​Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 13% to $6.09 billion (or 52.4% of sales) from $5.39 billion (or 53.1% of sales) for the same period in 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily the result of sales from new stores, the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from the acquired Mayasa stores and one additional day due to Leap Day. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, was due to the comparable period in the prior year receiving a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to tariff related, industry-wide acquisition cost increases, and corresponding selling price increases, and the lower gross margin sales from the acquired Mayasa stores, due to their large independent jobber customer base, partially offset by a greater percentage of total sales generated from DIY customers, which carry a higher gross margin than professional service provider sales and acquisition cost reductions. We determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, but have, over time, seen our LIFO reserve balance exhausted as a result of cumulative historical acquisition cost decreases. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost.​Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 6% to $3.67 billion (or 31.6% of sales) from $3.47 billion (or 34.2% of sales) for the same period in 2019. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2020, was the result of facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, expense from the acquired Mayasa stores and one additional day due to Leap Day. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, was principally due to leverage of store operating costs on strong comparable store sales growth combined with our cautionary approach and strict expense control measures in response to the onset of the COVID-19 environment.​Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 26% to $2.42 billion (or 20.8% of sales) from $1.92 billion (or 18.9% of sales) for the same period in 2019.​Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 17% to $153 million (or 1.3% of sales), from $130 million (or 1.3% of sales) for the same period in 2019. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings. ​Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 29% to $514 million (22.7% effective tax rate) from $399 million (22.3% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2019. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020, was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments in 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was the result of the lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments in 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. ​Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 26% to $1.75 billion (or 15.1% of sales), from $1.39 billion (or 13.7% of sales) for the same period in 2019.​Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 32% to $23.53 on 74 million shares from $17.88 on 78 million shares for the same period in 2019. ​2019 Compared to 2018​A discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page. ​30 ​LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES​Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. ​As we operated amid uncertainty and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have demonstrated our ability to take prudent steps to support the future stability and financial flexibility of our Company. At the onset of disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Teams took decisive action to reduce costs and conserve cash, which included delaying capital investments, reducing operating costs and temporarily suspending our share repurchase program from March 16, 2020, through May 28, 2020. As we are unable to determine the duration or potential increase in severity of this crisis, we cannot predict its future impacts on our ability to generate funds from operations or maintain liquidity, and accordingly, we will continue to make adjustments as we navigate the current and expected environment.​Liquidity and related ratios:The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​December 31, ​PercentageLiquidity and Related Ratios 2020 2019​ChangeCurrent assets​$ 4,500​$ 3,834 17.4%Current liabilities​ 5,262​ 4,469 17.7%Working capital (1)​ (763)​ (636) (20.0)%Total debt​ 4,123​ 3,891 6.0%Total equity​$ 140​$ 397 (64.7)%Debt to equity (2)​ 29.40:1​ 9.79:1 200.2%(1)Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.(2)Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity.​Current assets increased 17%, current liabilities increased 18%, total debt increased 6% and total equity decreased 65% from 2019 to 2020. The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in cash, resulting from our strong sales in 2020, and inventory, resulting from our distribution expansion projects and the opening of 156 net, new stores in 2020. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, which was the result of higher inventory turns on strong sales, and accrued benefits and withholdings, which was the result of deferred payroll tax payments under the CARES Act and Team member incentive payments. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 114.5% as of December 31, 2020, as compared to 104.4% for the same period in 2019. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $500 million of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2030 and $500 million of 1.750% Senior Notes due 2031, partially offset by the redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2020. The decrease in total equity was due to an increase in retained deficit, resulting from a greater impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, partially offset by net income for the year ended December 31, 2020. ​31 ​The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, Liquidity: 2020 2019Total cash provided by/(used in): ​ ​ Operating activities​$ 2,836,603​$ 1,708,479Investing activities​ (614,895)​ (796,746)Financing activities​ (1,796,577)​ (902,811)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash​​ 103​​ 169Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents​$ 425,234​$ 9,091​​​​​​​Capital expenditures​$ 465,579​$ 628,057Free cash flow (1)​​ 2,189,995​​ 1,020,649(1)Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments and investment in tax credit equity investments for the period.​Cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the U.S. were $11.5 million and $5.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in Mexico.​Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net inventory investment, a larger increase in net income, an increase in income taxes payable and an increase in accrued benefits and withholdings. The larger decrease in net inventory investment in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to the strong comparable store sales growth and the resulting benefit to inventory turns. The increase in income taxes payable in 2020, compared to the decrease in income taxes payable in 2019, was primarily the result of the realization of credits from renewable energy tax credit investments and an income taxes payable position at the end of 2020, versus a prepaid income taxes position at the end of 2019. The increase in accrued benefits and withholdings is primarily due to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the CARES Act and the timing of Team Member incentive payments. ​Investing activities:The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities, partially offset by an increase in investments in tax credit equity investments. Total capital expenditures were $466 million in 2020 versus $628 million in 2019, and the decrease was primarily related to lower new store project development spending in 2020, as compared to 2019, and the level of distribution expansion projects in 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease in other investment activities was due to the acquisition of Mayasa in 2019. The increase in investments in tax credit equity investments was the result of entering into more renewable energy tax credit investments in 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits.​We opened 156 and 200 net, new stores in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, on January 1, 2019, we began operating 33 acquired Bennett stores, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, we merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. After the close of business on November 29, 2019, we acquired 21 stores from Mayasa. We plan to open 165 to 175 net, new stores in 2021. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.​Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in repurchases of our common stock during 2020, compared to 2019, the redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2020, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2020, compared to 2019.​2019 Compared to 2018:A discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 32 ​December 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.​Unsecured revolving credit facility:On April 5, 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in April 2022. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may, from time to time, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $600 million, provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $1.8 billion at any time.​As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amounts of $66.4 million and $38.9 million, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Credit Agreement by those amounts. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, versus $261.0 million as of December 31, 2019.​Senior Notes:On March 27, 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.200% Senior Notes due 2030 (“4.200% Senior Notes due 2030”) at a price to the public of 99.959% of their face value with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) as trustee. Interest on the 4.200% Senior Notes due 2030 is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, which began on October 1, 2020, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.​On September 23, 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 1.750% Senior Notes due 2031 (“1.750% Senior Notes due 2031”) at a price to the public of 99.544% of their face value with U.S. Bank as trustee. Interest on the 1.750% Senior Notes due 2031 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year.​On October 14, 2020, we redeemed our $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 at a redemption price of $500 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.​As of December 31, 2020, we have issued and have outstanding a cumulative $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, which are due between 2021 and 2031, with UMB Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank as trustees. Interest on the senior notes, ranging from 1.750% to 4.625%, is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor under our senior notes.​Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.​The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.​We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.93 times and 5.21 times as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.92 times and 2.20 times as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.33 ​ ​The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended​​​December 31, ​​ 2020 2019GAAP net income​$ 1,752,302​$ 1,391,042Add:Interest expense​ 161,126​ 139,975​Rent expense (1)​ 354,316​ 338,697​Provision for income taxes​ 514,103​ 399,287​Depreciation expense​ 305,566​ 270,076​Amortization expense​ 9,069​ 799​Non-cash share-based compensation​ 22,747​ 21,921Non-GAAP EBITDAR​$ 3,119,229​$ 2,561,797​​​​​​​​Interest expense​$ 161,126​$ 139,975​Capitalized interest​ 10,180​ 12,998​Rent expense (1)​ 354,316​ 338,697Total fixed charges​$ 525,622​$ 491,670​​​​​​​​Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio​ 5.93​ 5.21​​​​​​​​GAAP debt​$ 4,123,217​$ 3,890,527Add:Stand-by letters of credit​ 66,427​ 38,870​Discount on senior notes​ 5,071​ 3,515​Debt issuance costs​ 21,712​ 16,958​Five-times rent expense​ 1,771,580​ 1,693,485Non-GAAP adjusted debt​$ 5,988,007​$ 5,643,355​​​​​​​​Consolidated leverage ratio​ 1.92​ 2.20​(1)The table below outlines the calculation of Rent expense and reconciles Rent expense to Total lease cost, per Accounting Standard Codification 842 (“ASC 842”), adopted and effective January 1, 2019, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2020 $ 420,365Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2020​ 66,049Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2020​$ 354,316​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2019​$ 398,294Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2019​​ 59,597Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2019​$ 338,697​The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2020 2019Cash provided by operating activities ​$ 2,836,603​$ 1,708,479Less:Capital expenditures​ 465,579​ 628,057​Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments​ 16,918​ 25,992​Investment in tax credit equity investments​ 164,111​ 33,781Free cash flow​$ 2,189,995​$ 1,020,649​34 ​Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.​Share repurchase program:In January of 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 5, 2020, October 28, 2020, and February 10, 2021, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $1.0 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $15.8 billion. Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date. In order to conserve liquidity in response to COVID-19, we suspended our share repurchase program on March 16, 2020. We continued to evaluate business conditions and our liquidity and, as a result of this evaluation, resumed our share repurchase program on May 29, 2020.​The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share data):​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2020 2019Shares repurchased ​ 4,832 ​ 3,877Average price per share​$ 431.93​$ 369.55Total investment​$ 2,087,146​$ 1,432,752​As of December 31, 2020, we had $481.5 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 26, 2021, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $447.49, for a total investment of $478.4 million. We have repurchased a total of 82.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 26, 2021, at an average price of $179.65 for a total aggregate investment of $14.7 billion. As of February 26, 2021, we had approximately $1.0 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. ​CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS​Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 “Leases,” Note 13 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” and Note 14 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.​Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2021, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.​We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 16 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a net liability of $35.9 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”​35 ​We record a reserve for the projected obligation related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which is fully disclosed in Note 13 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This estimate is not included in the table below because the timing related to the ultimate payment cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a liability of $40.4 million related to this uncertain liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included in “Other liabilities.”​The following table identifies the estimated payments of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments Due By Period​​​​Before​Years ​Years ​Years 5Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 and 2 3 and 4 and OverLong-term debt principal and interest payments (1)​$ 5,121,911​$ 453,410​$ 861,581​$ 231,500​$ 3,575,420Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2)​ 2,415,508​ 322,477​ 589,425​ 457,298​ 1,046,308Self-insurance reserves (3)​ 213,332​ 109,199​ 65,489​ 25,233​ 13,411Construction commitments​ 38,268​ 38,268​ —​ —​ —Total contractual cash obligations​$ 7,789,019​$ 923,354​$ 1,516,495​$ 714,031​$ 4,635,139(1)Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.900% and our facility fee was 0.100%. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.(2)The minimum lease payments above do not include potential amounts for percentage rent and other variable operating lease related costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. See Note 6 “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases.(3)We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. See Note 14 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves. ​OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS​Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over 10 years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans.​We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub-limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $66.4 million and $38.9 million were outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.​We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES​The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial 36 ​statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.​Supplier Concessions:We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.​Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:We evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. As a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. Areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. If events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed. Based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of December 31, 2020. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. ​Self-Insurance Reserves:We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date, and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2020, the financial impact would have been approximately $20 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2020. ​37 ​INFLATION AND SEASONALITY​We have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.​To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. ​RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements. ​​38 ​Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk​Interest rate risk:We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.​We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.​Cash equivalents risk:We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $465.6 million.​Foreign currency risk:Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.​We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $149.2 million at December 31, 2020. The year ended December 31, 2020, exchange rates of the Mexican peso with respect to the U.S. dollar decreased by approximately 5% from December 31, 2019. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2020, would be approximately $13.6 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations. ​​39 ​",2023-12-30 21:19:04.363665
898173,ORLY,O REILLY AUTOMOTIVE INC,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​In Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including●an overview of the key drivers and other influences to of the automotive aftermarket industry;●key events and recent developments within our Company;●our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020;●our liquidity and capital resources;●our critical accounting estimates; and●recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our Company.​The review of Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report. ​OVERVIEW​We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States and Mexico. We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. ​Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.​Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 5,759 stores in 47 U.S. states and 25 stores in Mexico.​We are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and our consumers, including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. Macroeconomic factors, such as total U.S. unemployment, and demand drivers specific to the automotive aftermarket, such as U.S. miles driven, have been pressured as a result of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay at home orders, work from home arrangements and reduced travel. However, government stimulus and additional unemployment benefits, the ongoing gradual reopening processes across markets we operate in and increased miles driven have positively impacted our performance. Due to the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we are unable to determine how long current conditions, including the pandemic, will persist and the degree of impact future changes may have on our business, industry or broader economic conditions.​We believe the key drivers of current and future long-term demand for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age.​Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, however for 2021, miles driven improved and increased 11.2%. Government measures or consumer and business behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could again have a negative impact on miles driven, but we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the impact to our business.​26 ​Size and Age of the Vehicle FleetThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 12.7% from 2010 to 2020, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 281 million by the end of 2020. Although the rate of new vehicle sales has been pressured due to supply chain constraints experienced by manufacturers, the outlook for the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term. From 2010 to 2020, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 12.3%, from 10.6 years in 2010 to 11.9 years in 2020.​We believe the increase in average vehicle age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. The increase in average vehicle age also benefits from an environment of a new vehicle scarcity and higher than typical used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.​We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. ​KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS​A key event that has had a significant impact on our operations is the COVID-19 pandemic. As we navigate the ongoing challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to place additional emphasis on the safety and wellness of our Team Members and our customers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the increased level of vaccinations, the ongoing reopening processes across markets we operate in, government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits positively impacted demand for the products we sell. We continue to keep our stores open and operating to meet our customers’ critical needs, while also ensuring the safety of our Team Members and customers through strict adherence to safety protocols. However, we cannot predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of its future impacts on our customers, our Team Members, our supply chain and overall industry demand. ​27 ​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The table below compares the Company’s selected financial data over a ten-year period:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year ended December 31, 2021202020192018201720162015201420132012(In thousands, except per share, Team Members, stores and ratio data) ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT INCOME STATEMENT RELATED DATA: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage increase in comparable store sales (a)(b) 13.3% 10.9% 4.0% 3.8% 1.4% 4.8% 7.5% 6.0% 4.6% 3.5% Sales ($) 13,327,563 11,604,493 10,149,985 9,536,428 8,977,726 8,593,096 7,966,674 7,216,081 6,649,237 6,182,184Gross profit 7,019,949 6,085,692 5,394,691 5,039,966 4,720,683 4,509,011 4,162,643 3,708,901 3,369,001 3,097,418Operating income 2,917,168 2,419,336 1,920,726 1,815,184 1,725,400 1,699,206 1,514,021 1,270,374 1,103,485 977,393Net income ($) (c)(d) 2,164,685 1,752,302 1,391,042 1,324,487 1,133,804 1,037,691 931,216 778,182 670,292 585,746Earnings per share – basic ($) 31.39 23.74 18.07 16.27 12.82 10.87 9.32 7.46 6.14 4.83Earnings per share – assuming dilution ($) (c)(d) 31.10 23.53 17.88 16.10 12.67 10.73 9.17 7.34 6.03 4.75​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW RELATED DATA:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total assets ($) (e) 11,718,707 11,596,642 10,717,160 7,980,789 7,571,885 7,204,189 6,676,684 6,532,083 6,057,895 5,741,241Total debt ($) (e)​ 3,826,978 4,123,217 3,890,527 3,417,122 2,978,390 1,887,019 1,390,018 1,388,422 1,386,895 1,088,011Shareholders’ equity ($) (c) (66,423) 140,258 397,340 353,667 653,046 1,627,136 1,961,314 2,018,418 1,966,321 2,108,307Inventory turnover (f) 1.7 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4Accounts payable to inventory (g) 127.4% 114.5% 104.4% 105.7% 106.0% 105.7% 99.1% 94.6% 86.6% 84.7% Cash provided by operating activities ($) (h) 3,207,310 2,836,603 1,708,479 1,727,555 1,403,687 1,510,713 1,345,488 1,190,430 908,026 1,251,555Capital expenditures ($) 442,853 465,579 628,057 504,268 465,940 476,344 414,020 429,987 395,881 300,719Free cash flow ($) (h)(i) 2,548,922 2,189,995 1,020,649 1,188,584 889,059 978,375 868,390 760,443 512,145 950,836​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT OPERATING DATA: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Number of Team Members at year end 82,852 77,654 82,484 78,882 75,552 74,580 71,621 67,569 61,909 53,063Total number of stores at year end (j)(k) 5,784 5,616 5,460 5,219 5,019 4,829 4,571 4,366 4,166 3,976Number of U.S. stores at year end (j)​ 5,759 5,594 5,439 5,219 5,019 4,829 4,571 4,366 4,166 3,976Number of Mexico stores at year end (k)​ 25 22 21 — — — — — — —Store square footage at year end (a)(l)​ 43,185 41,668 40,227 38,455 36,685 35,123 33,148 31,591 30,077 28,628Sales per weighted-average store ($) (a)(m) 2,298 2,057 1,881 1,842 1,807 1,826 1,769 1,678 1,614 1,590Sales per weighted-average square foot ($) (a)(l)(n) 307 277 255 251 248 251 244 232 224 224​(a)Represents O’Reilly’s U.S. operations only.(b)Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of U.S. stores open at least one year and excludes sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members, sales from Leap Day during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2016 and 2012. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders, for U.S. stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.(c)During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that requires excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation payments to be recorded through the income statement. In compliance with the standard, the Company did not restate prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. The Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings, due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for more information.(d)Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017, the Company revalued its deferred income tax liabilities, which resulted in a one-time benefit to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 13 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for more information.(e)Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of new accounting standards during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015.

(“Bennett”), respectively. The 2012 VIP acquisition added 56 stores, and the 2016 Bond acquisition added 48 stores to the O’Reilly store count. After the close of business on December 31, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Bennett, including 33 stores that were not included in the 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018, but beginning January 1, 2019, the operations of the acquired Bennett locations were included in the Company’s store count, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.(k)In 2019, the Company acquired Mayoreo de Autopartes y Aceites, S.A. de C.V. (“Mayasa”), which added 21 stores to the O’Reilly store count. Financial results for this acquired company have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning from the date of the acquisition.(l)Square footage includes normal selling, office, stockroom and receiving space.(m)Sales per weighted-average store are weighted to consider the approximate dates of store openings, acquisitions or closures.(n)Sales per weighted-average square foot are weighted to consider the approximate dates of domestic store openings, acquisitions, expansions or closures. ​The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales, which is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals due to rounding differences, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2021​2020Sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 47.3​​ 47.6 Gross profit 52.7​​ 52.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 30.8​​ 31.6 Operating income 21.9 ​ 20.8 Interest expense (1.1)​​ (1.4) Interest income 0.1​​ 0.1 Income before income taxes 20.9​​ 19.5​Provision for income taxes 4.6​​ 4.4 Net income (1) 16.2% ​ 15.1% (1) Each percentage of sales amount is computed independently and may not compute to presented totals.​2021 Compared to 2020​Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $1.72 billion, or 15%, to $13.33 billion from $11.60 billion for the same period in 2020. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 13.3% and 10.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for U.S. domestic stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day in the year ended December 31, 2020. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders, for stores open at least one year, are included in the comparable store sales calculation.​29 ​The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 (in millions):​​​​​ Increase in Sales for the Year Ended ​​December 31, 2021,​​Compared to the Same Period in 2020Store sales: ​ Comparable store sales​$ 1,496Non-comparable store sales:​ ​Sales for stores opened throughout 2020, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales, and Mexico store sales​ 81Sales for stores opened throughout 2021​ 140Sales from Leap Day​​ (34)Sales for stores that have closed, including temporarily closed stores​ (2)Non-store sales:​ Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members​ 42Total increase in sales​$ 1,723​We believe the increased sales are the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. The government stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, and general economic recovery, including lifting of stay at home orders and associated ongoing market reopenings, when combined with positive industry dynamics, such as consumers investing in existing vehicles and favorable weather, contributed to strong demand in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, despite the global supply chain disruptions that created inventory availability challenges for our industry during the year ended December 31, 2021, the strength of our distribution network and our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better in-stock inventory positions than the broader market and contributed to our sales growth.​Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, was driven by increases in average ticket and transaction counts for both professional service provider and DIY customers. Average ticket values continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. The resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. Average ticket values continue to benefit from consumers spending additional time and money repairing and maintaining their vehicles in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic environment and the new and used vehicle scarcity. Average ticket values also benefited from increases in average selling prices, on a same-SKU basis, as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed on in market prices. 2021 transaction counts improved due to prior year headwinds to traffic from the initial COVID-19 stay at home orders in 2020 and business restrictions, which resulted in immediate pressure to transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers, combined with continued market reopening and recovery activity, ongoing government stimulus, favorable winter and spring weather conditions and a benefit from new and used vehicle scarcity positively impacting our customers’ willingness to perform or invest in maintenance on their vehicles.​We opened 165 net, new U.S. stores and three new stores in Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to opening 155 net, new U.S. stores and one new store in Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 5,759 stores in 47 U.S. states and 25 stores in Mexico compared to 5,594 U.S. stores in 47 states and 22 stores in Mexico at December 31, 2020. We anticipate new store growth will be 175 to 185 net, new store openings in 2022.​Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 15% to $7.02 billion (or 52.7% of sales) from $6.09 billion (or 52.4% of sales) for the same period in 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, partially offset by prior year gross profit dollars generated from one additional day due to Leap Day. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, was due to a benefit from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases, partially offset by increased distribution costs. We determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method but had, over time, seen our LIFO reserve balance exhausted, resulting in a LIFO inventory value above replacement cost prior to the third 30 ​quarter ended September 30, 2021. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, and accordingly, we had effectively valued our inventory at replacement cost, resulting in a benefit when selling prices increase as we sold through this lower cost inventory. During 2021, our LIFO reserve reverted back to a more typical credit balance due to recent, significant inflation in acquisition costs; as a result, we anticipate a diminishing benefit moving forward from the final sell through of inventory valued at older, lower replacement cost. Increased distribution system costs were driven by the significant increase in volumes over the past year, challenging labor markets and ongoing global logistical supply chain pressures.​Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 12% to $4.10 billion (or 30.8% of sales) from $3.67 billion (or 31.6% of sales) for the same period in 2020. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2021, was the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, increased incentive compensation for Team Members resulting from our increased sales and operating profits and prior year strict expense control measures in response to the onset of the pandemic environment. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, was principally due to strong leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales growth and higher average store sales volumes.​Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 21% to $2.92 billion (or 21.9% of sales) from $2.42 billion (or 20.8% of sales) for the same period in 2020.​Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased 12% to $135 million (or 1.0% of sales), from $153 million (or 1.3% of sales) for the same period in 2020. The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, was the result of decreased interest expense on lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average cost of borrowings. ​Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 20% to $617 million (22.2% effective tax rate) from $514 million (22.7% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2020. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021, was the result of higher taxable income, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was the result of the higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a greater benefit from tax credit equity investments. ​Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 24% to $2.16 billion (or 16.2% of sales), from $1.75 billion (or 15.1% of sales) for the same period in 2020.​Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 32% to $31.10 on 70 million shares from $23.53 on 74 million shares for the same period in 2020. ​2020 Compared to 2019​A discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page. ​LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES​Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases, human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits, 31 ​contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and other operational priorities. We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products, changes in customer buying patterns or the impact of the uncertainty and disruption cause by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. ​Our material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2021, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes and commitments for the purchase of inventory, all of which are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. See Note 5 “Leases,” Note 12 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans,” Note 13 “Commitments” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our leasing arrangements, share-based compensation payments, construction commitments and uncertain tax positions, respectively, which are not reflected in the table below. ​The following table identifies the estimated payments for each of the next five years, and in the aggregate thereafter, of the Company’s debt instruments and related interest payments and self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​December 31, 2021​​Long-Term Debt Principal​Self-Insurance​ and Interest Payments (1) Reserves (2)2022​$ 440,183​$ 128,7942023​ 423,485​ 40,0512024​ 117,550​ 26,1522025​ 117,550​ 15,8162026​​ 607,355​ 9,427Thereafter​​ 2,968,890​ 12,945Contractual cash obligations​$ 4,675,013​$ 233,185(1)See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt instruments and related interest payments.(2)See Note 13 “Commitments” and Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.​Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms, the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions and commitments related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2022, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.​Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. We are required to make capital contributions totaling $5.7 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar or wind energy farms, the timing of which is variable and outside of the Company’s control. See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our stand-by letters of credit. ​We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ​32 ​The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, Liquidity: 2021 2020 2019Total cash provided by/(used in): ​ ​ ​ Operating activities​$ 3,207,310​$ 2,836,603​$ 1,708,479Investing activities​ (615,620)​ (614,895)​ (796,746)Financing activities​ (2,694,858)​ (1,796,577)​ (902,811)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash​​ (359)​​ 103​​ 169Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents​$ (103,527)​$ 425,234​$ 9,091​​​​​​​​​​Capital expenditures​$ 442,853​$ 465,579​$ 628,057Free cash flow (1)​​ 2,548,922​​ 2,189,995​ 1,020,649(1)Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments and investment in tax credit equity investments for the period.​Cash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the U.S. were $7.5 million and $11.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in Mexico.​Operating activities:The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in net income and a larger decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings. The larger decrease in net inventory investment in 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to the strong comparable store sales growth and the resulting benefit to inventory turns. The decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings is primarily due to the deferral of payroll tax payments under the CARES Act in 2020. ​Investing activities:Cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was relatively flat, with the slight change due primarily to entering into more renewable energy tax credit investments in 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. ​We opened 168 and 155 net, new stores in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We plan to open 175 to 185 net, new stores in 2022. The current costs associated with the opening of a new store, including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.​Financing activities:The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to debt repayments of $300 million in 2021, compared to net, borrowings of $236 million in 2020, and an increase in repurchases of our common stock.​2020 Compared to 2019:A discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.​Debt instruments:See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company’s credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit and unsecured senior notes. ​Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our 33 ​ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.​The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.​We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.97 times and 5.93 times as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.59 times and 1.92 times as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. ​34 ​The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended​​​December 31, ​​ 2021 2020GAAP net income​$ 2,164,685​$ 1,752,302Add:Interest expense​ 144,768​ 161,126​Rent expense (1)​ 372,022​ 354,316​Provision for income taxes​ 617,229​ 514,103​Depreciation expense​ 320,352​ 305,566​Amortization expense​ 7,865​ 9,069​Non-cash share-based compensation​ 24,656​ 22,747Non-GAAP EBITDAR​$ 3,651,577​$ 3,119,229​​​​​​​​Interest expense​$ 144,768​$ 161,126​Capitalized interest​ 7,001​ 10,180​Rent expense (1)​ 372,022​ 354,316Total fixed charges​$ 523,791​$ 525,622​​​​​​​​Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio​ 6.97​ 5.93​​​​​​​​GAAP debt​$ 3,826,978​$ 4,123,217Add:Stand-by letters of credit​ 83,985​ 66,427​Discount on senior notes​ 4,360​ 5,071​Debt issuance costs​ 18,662​ 21,712​Five-times rent expense​ 1,860,110​ 1,771,580Non-GAAP adjusted debt​$ 5,794,095​$ 5,988,007​​​​​​​​Consolidated leverage ratio​ 1.59​ 1.92​(1)The table below outlines the calculation of Rent expense and reconciles Rent expense to Total lease cost, per Accounting Standard Codification 842 (“ASC 842”), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2021 $ 443,484Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2021​ 71,462Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2021​$ 372,022​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2020​$ 420,365Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2020​​ 66,049Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2020​$ 354,316​The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2021 2020 2019Cash provided by operating activities ​$ 3,207,310​$ 2,836,603​$ 1,708,479Less:Capital expenditures​ 442,853​ 465,579​ 628,057​Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments​ 35,202​ 16,918​ 25,992​Investment in tax credit equity investments​ 180,333​ 164,111​ 33,781Free cash flow​$ 2,548,922​$ 2,189,995​$ 1,020,649​Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial 35 ​information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.​Share repurchase program:See Note 9 “Share Repurchase Program” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchase program. ​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.​Self-Insurance Reserves:We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. ​When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. The application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. ​As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. ​Our self-insurance reserve estimate included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets increased $19.8 million from 2020 to 2021, which is primarily due to our growing operations, including inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience. If the underlying assumptions in management’s estimate changed self-insurance reserves 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2021, the financial impact would have been approximately $22 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.​Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:We evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future 36 ​cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. ​As a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. Areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. If events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed. ​Based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of December 31, 2021. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. See Note 6 “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our finite and indefinite long-lived assets. ​RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements. ​​37 ​Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk​Interest rate risk:We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.​We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.1 billion and $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.​Cash equivalents risk:We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $362.1 million.​Foreign currency risk:Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.​We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $152.6 million at December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021, exchange rates of the Mexican peso, relative to the U.S. dollar, weakened by approximately 3.0% from December 31, 2020. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021, would be approximately $13.9 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations. ​​38 ​",2023-12-30 21:19:03.041809
898173,ORLY,O REILLY AUTOMOTIVE INC,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations​In Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including●an overview of the key drivers and other influences on the automotive aftermarket industry;●our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021;●our liquidity and capital resources;●our critical accounting estimates; and●recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our Company.​The review of Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report. ​OVERVIEW​We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States and Mexico. We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.” Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. ​Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry. We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.​Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 5,929 stores in 47 U.S. states and 42 stores in Mexico.​We are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, including rising consumer staples, fuel and energy costs, unemployment trends, interest rates and other economic factors. Future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid increases in fuel costs that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers’ level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry.​We believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales and average vehicle age.​Number of Miles Driven The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. decreased 13.2% in 2020, as a result of responses to the coronavirus pandemic, including work from home arrangements and reduced travel. In 2021, miles driven improved and increased 11.2%, and year-to-date through November of 2022, miles driven continued to improve, increasing 1.2%. Total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future.​Size and Age of the Vehicle FleetThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 12.1% from 2011 to 2021, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 279 million by the end of 2021. In 2022, the rate of new 26 ​vehicle sales was pressured due to supply chain constraints experienced by manufacturers, and the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was below the historical average at approximately 13.3 million vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2022. From 2011 to 2021, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually. As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 11.0%, from 10.9 years in 2011 to 12.1 years in 2021. While the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term, we believe our business benefits from the current environment of new vehicle scarcity and higher than typical used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle.​We believe the increase in average vehicle age over the long term can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.​Inflationary cost pressures impact our business; however, historically we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases, principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases or other input cost increases affecting the entire industry, we have typically been able to pass along these cost increases through higher selling prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.​We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. ​​ ​27 ​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​The table below compares the Company’s selected financial data over a ten-year period:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Year ended December 31, 2022202120202019201820172016201520142013(In thousands, except per share, Team Members, stores and ratio data) ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT INCOME STATEMENT RELATED DATA: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percentage increase in comparable store sales (a)(b) 6.4% 13.3% 10.9% 4.0% 3.8% 1.4% 4.8% 7.5% 6.0% 4.6% Sales ($) 14,409,860 13,327,563 11,604,493 10,149,985 9,536,428 8,977,726 8,593,096 7,966,674 7,216,081 6,649,237Gross profit 7,381,706 7,019,949 6,085,692 5,394,691 5,039,966 4,720,683 4,509,011 4,162,643 3,708,901 3,369,001Operating income 2,954,491 2,917,168 2,419,336 1,920,726 1,815,184 1,725,400 1,699,206 1,514,021 1,270,374 1,103,485Net income ($) (c)(d) 2,172,650 2,164,685 1,752,302 1,391,042 1,324,487 1,133,804 1,037,691 931,216 778,182 670,292Earnings per share – basic ($) 33.75 31.39 23.74 18.07 16.27 12.82 10.87 9.32 7.46 6.14Earnings per share – assuming dilution ($) (c)(d) 33.44 31.10 23.53 17.88 16.10 12.67 10.73 9.17 7.34 6.03​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW RELATED DATA:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total assets ($) (e) 12,627,979 11,718,707 11,596,642 10,717,160 7,980,789 7,571,885 7,204,189 6,676,684 6,532,083 6,057,895Total debt ($) (e)​ 4,371,653 3,826,978 4,123,217 3,890,527 3,417,122 2,978,390 1,887,019 1,390,018 1,388,422 1,386,895Shareholders’ equity ($) (c) (1,060,752) (66,423) 140,258 397,340 353,667 653,046 1,627,136 1,961,314 2,018,418 1,966,321Inventory turnover (f) 1.7 1.7 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.4Accounts payable to inventory (g) 134.9% 127.4% 114.5% 104.4% 105.7% 106.0% 105.7% 99.1% 94.6% 86.6% Cash provided by operating activities ($) (h) 3,148,250 3,207,310 2,836,603 1,708,479 1,727,555 1,403,687 1,510,713 1,345,488 1,190,430 908,026Capital expenditures ($) 563,342 442,853 465,579 628,057 504,268 465,940 476,344 414,020 429,987 395,881Free cash flow ($) (h)(i) 2,371,123 2,548,922 2,189,995 1,020,649 1,188,584 889,059 978,375 868,390 760,443 512,145​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​SELECT OPERATING DATA: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Number of Team Members at year end 87,377 82,852 77,654 82,484 78,882 75,552 74,580 71,621 67,569 61,909Total number of stores at year end (j)(k) 5,971 5,784 5,616 5,460 5,219 5,019 4,829 4,571 4,366 4,166Number of U.S. stores at year end (j)​ 5,929 5,759 5,594 5,439 5,219 5,019 4,829 4,571 4,366 4,166Number of Mexico stores at year end (k)​ 42 25 22 21 — — — — — —Store square footage at year end (a)(l)​ 44,604 43,185 41,668 40,227 38,455 36,685 35,123 33,148 31,591 30,077Sales per weighted-average store ($) (a)(m) 2,415 2,298 2,057 1,881 1,842 1,807 1,826 1,769 1,678 1,614Sales per weighted-average square foot ($) (a)(l)(n) 322 307 277 255 251 248 251 244 232 224​(a)Represents O’Reilly’s U.S. operations only.(b)Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of U.S. stores open at least one year and excludes sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members, and sales from Leap Day during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2016.

(“Bennett”), respectively. After the close of business on December 31, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Bennett, including 33 stores that were not included in the 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018, but beginning January 1, 2019, the operations of the acquired Bennett locations were included in the Company’s store count, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores. Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.(k)In 2019, the Company acquired Mayoreo de Autopartes y Aceites, S.A. de C.V. (“Mayasa”), which added 21 stores to the O’Reilly store count. Financial results for this acquired company have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning from the date of the acquisition.(l)Square footage includes normal selling, office, stockroom and receiving space.(m)Sales per weighted-average store are weighted to consider the approximate dates of store openings, acquisitions or closures.(n)Sales per weighted-average square foot are weighted to consider the approximate dates of domestic store openings, acquisitions, expansions or closures. ​The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales, which is calculated independently and may not compute to presented totals due to rounding differences, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, ​ 2022​2021Sales 100.0% ​ 100.0% Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 48.8​​ 47.3 Gross profit 51.2​​ 52.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 30.7​​ 30.8 Operating income 20.5 ​ 21.9 Interest expense (1.1)​​ (1.1) Interest income —​​ 0.1 Income before income taxes 19.4​​ 20.9​Provision for income taxes 4.3​​ 4.6 Net income (1) 15.1% ​ 16.2% (1) Each percentage of sales amount is calculated independently and may not compute to presented totals.​2022 Compared to 2021​Sales:Sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.08 billion, or 8%, to $14.41 billion from $13.33 billion for the same period in 2021. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.4% and 13.3% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation.​29 ​The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in millions):​​​​​ Increase in Sales for the Year Ended ​​December 31, 2022,​​Compared to the Same Period in 2021Store sales: ​ Comparable store sales​$ 835Non-comparable store sales:​ ​Sales for U.S. stores opened throughout 2021, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales, and Mexico store sales​ 95Sales for U.S. stores opened throughout 2022​ 137Sales for stores that have closed, including temporarily closed stores​ (6)Non-store sales:​ ​Includes sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members​ 21Total increase in sales​$ 1,082​We believe the increased sales are the result of store growth, the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory from our regional distribution centers and hub store network, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, the Omnichannel experience, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. In addition, the strength of our distribution network and our strong supplier relationships allowed us to maintain better in-stock inventory positions than the broader market and contributed to our sales growth. ​Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven by increases in average ticket values for both professional service provider and DIY customers and positive transaction counts from professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative transaction counts from DIY customers. Average ticket values benefited from increases in average selling prices, on a same-SKU basis, as compared to 2021, driven by increases in acquisition costs of inventory, which were passed on in selling prices. Average ticket values also continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time. The resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost of replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values. The decrease in DIY customer transaction counts was driven by a challenging comparison to the strong transaction counts in 2021, which were aided by government stimulus, and broad-based inflationary pressures on the consumer.​We opened 187 and 168 net, new stores during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate new store growth will be 180 to 190 net, new store openings in 2023.​Gross profit:Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 5% to $7.38 billion (or 51.2% of sales) from $7.02 billion (or 52.7% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily the result of new store sales and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, was due to the impact from the rollout of our professional pricing initiative, which was a strategic investment aimed at ensuring we are more competitively priced on the professional side of our business; a greater percentage of our total sales mix generated from professional service provider customers, which carry a lower gross margin than DIY sales; and a greater benefit in the prior year from selling through inventory purchased prior to recent acquisition cost increases and corresponding selling price increases. We determine inventory cost using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method but had, over time, seen our LIFO reserve balance exhausted, which resulted in a LIFO inventory value above replacement cost prior to September 30, 2021. As our policy is to not write-up inventory in excess of replacement cost, we had been effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost, which resulted in a benefit when selling prices increased as we sold through this lower cost inventory. In the third quarter of 2021, our LIFO reserve reverted back to a more typical credit balance, due to the significant inflationary acquisition cost increases. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we realized the final benefit from selling through inventory valued at the older, lower replacement cost, at a lesser amount than the full year benefit received in 2021. ​30 ​Selling, general and administrative expenses:Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 8% to $4.43 billion (or 30.7% of sales) from $4.10 billion (or 30.8% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and a non-cash charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program for our Team Members. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, was principally due to leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales, partially offset by inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and the charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program.​Operating income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 1% to $2.95 billion (or 20.5% of sales) from $2.92 billion (or 21.9% of sales) for the same period in 2021.​Other income and expense:Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 15% to $156 million (or 1.1% of sales), from $135 million (or 1.0% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings, as well as a decrease in the value of our trading securities, as compared to an increase in the same period in 2021. ​Income taxes:Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 1% to $626 million (22.4% effective tax rate) from $617 million (22.2% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2021. The increase in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of higher taxable income and lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of the lower excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. ​Net income:As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased to $2.17 billion (or 15.1% of sales), from $2.16 billion (or 16.2% of sales) for the same period in 2021.​Earnings per share:Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 8% to $33.44 on 65 million shares from $31.10 on 70 million shares for the same period in 2021. ​2021 Compared to 2020​A discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page. ​LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES​Our long-term business strategy requires capital to invest open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain our existing stores, develop enhanced information technology systems and tools and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases, human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits, contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and other operational priorities. We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior note offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our 31 ​products or changes in customer buying patterns. Additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. ​Our material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2022, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes and commitments for the purchase of inventory. We expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. See Note 5 “Leases,” Note 12 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans,” Note 13 “Commitments” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our leasing arrangements, share-based compensation payments, construction commitments and uncertain tax positions, respectively, which are not reflected in the table below. ​The following table identifies the estimated payments for each of the next five years, and in the aggregate thereafter, of the Company’s debt instruments and related interest payments and self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​December 31, 2022​​Long-Term Debt Principal​Self-Insurance​ and Interest Payments (1) Reserves (2)2023​$ 463,275​$ 138,9262024​ 157,500​ 40,3472025​ 157,500​ 27,8032026​ 647,650​ 16,7362027​​ 887,950​ 8,192Thereafter​​ 3,153,025​ 13,558Contractual cash obligations​$ 5,466,900​$ 245,562(1)See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt instruments and related interest payments.(2)See Note 13 “Commitments” and Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.​Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms, the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions and commitments related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2023, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.​Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have entered into an agreement to make capital contributions to certain tax credit equity investments for the purpose of receiving renewable energy tax credits. We are required to make capital contributions totaling $3.4 million upon achievement of project milestones by the solar or wind energy farms, the timing of which is variable and outside of the Company’s control. See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our stand-by letters of credit. ​We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. ​32 ​The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​December 31, Liquidity: 2022 2021 2020Total cash provided by/(used in): ​ ​ ​ Operating activities​$ 3,148,250​$ 3,207,310​$ 2,836,603Investing activities​ (739,985)​ (615,620)​ (614,895)Financing activities​ (2,662,536)​ (2,694,858)​ (1,796,577)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash​​ 741​​ (359)​​ 103Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents​$ (253,530)​$ (103,527)​$ 425,234​​​​​​​​​​Capital expenditures​$ 563,342​$ 442,853​$ 465,579Free cash flow (1)​​ 2,371,123​​ 2,548,922​ 2,189,995(1)Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments and investment in tax credit equity investments for the period.

The larger decrease in accrued benefits and withholdings was primarily due to higher accrued incentive compensation payments in 2022 versus 2021. ​Investing activities:The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in store and distribution enhancement and expansion projects in 2022 versus 2021. ​We opened 187 and 168 net, new stores in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to open 180 to 190 net, new stores in 2023. The costs associated with the expected openings of owned store locations in 2023, including the cost of land acquisition, building construction, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $2.8 million to $3.0 million per store; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site.​Financing activities:The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2022, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock in 2022.​2021 Compared to 2020:A discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.​Debt instruments:See Note 7 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company’s credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit and unsecured senior notes. ​Debt covenants:The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the 33 ​indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.​The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest and rent expense. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders.​We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.71 times and 6.97 times as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.73 times and 1.59 times as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. ​34 ​The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended​​​December 31, ​​ 2022 2021GAAP net income​$ 2,172,650​$ 2,164,685Add:Interest expense​ 157,720​ 144,768​Rent expense (1)​ 393,032​ 372,022​Provision for income taxes​ 626,005​ 617,229​Depreciation expense​ 352,224​ 320,352​Amortization expense​ 5,709​ 7,865​Non-cash share-based compensation​ 26,458​ 24,656Non-GAAP EBITDAR​$ 3,733,798​$ 3,651,577​​​​​​​​Interest expense​$ 157,720​$ 144,768​Capitalized interest​ 5,488​ 7,001​Rent expense (1)​ 393,032​ 372,022Total fixed charges​$ 556,240​$ 523,791​​​​​​​​Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio​ 6.71​ 6.97​​​​​​​​GAAP debt​$ 4,371,653​$ 3,826,978Add:Stand-by letters of credit​ 101,741​ 83,985​Discount on senior notes​ 6,285​ 4,360​Debt issuance costs​ 22,062​ 18,662​Five-times rent expense​ 1,965,160​ 1,860,110Non-GAAP adjusted debt​$ 6,466,901​$ 5,794,095​​​​​​​​Consolidated leverage ratio​ 1.73​ 1.59​(1)The table below outlines the calculation of Rent expense and reconciles Rent expense to Total lease cost, per Accounting Standard Codification 842 (“ASC 842”), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2022 $ 467,758Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2022​ 74,726Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2022​$ 393,032​​​​​Total lease cost, per ASC 842, for the year ended December 31, 2021​$ 443,484Less:Variable non-contract operating lease components, related to property taxes and insurance, for the year ended December 31, 2021​​ 71,462Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2021​$ 372,022​The table below outlines the calculation of Free cash flow and reconciles Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​For the Year Ended ​​​December 31, ​​ 2022 2021 2020Cash provided by operating activities ​$ 3,148,250​$ 3,207,310​$ 2,836,603Less:Capital expenditures​ 563,342​ 442,853​ 465,579​Excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments​ 25,503​ 35,202​ 16,918​Investment in tax credit equity investments​ 188,282​ 180,333​ 164,111Free cash flow​$ 2,371,123​$ 2,548,922​$ 2,189,995​Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial 35 ​information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.​Share repurchase program:See Note 9 “Share Repurchase Program” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchase program. ​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.​Self-Insurance Reserves:We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. ​When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using the U.S. treasury risk-free rate. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to resolve reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. The application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. ​As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. ​Our self-insurance reserve estimate included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets increased $11 million from 2021 to 2022, which is primarily due to our growing operations, inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience. If the underlying assumptions in management’s estimate changed self-insurance reserves 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2022, the financial impact would have been approximately $23 million or 0.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.​Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:We evaluate the carrying value of finite and indefinite long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As a component of the finite long-lived assets evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future 36 ​cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. ​As a component of the indefinite long-lived assets evaluation, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events or circumstances that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset have occurred, as well as if they continue to support an indefinite useful life. Areas evaluated include changes in cost factors such as raw materials or labor, financial performance including declining revenues or cash flows, the legal, regulatory and political environment, and other industry and market considerations, including the competitive environment and changes in product demand. If events or market conditions exist that would more likely than not indicate that impairment may be necessary, a detailed quantitative assessment would be performed. ​Based on our qualitative assessment, we do not believe there has been a change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a calculation of fair value of indefinite long-lived assets is required as of December 31, 2022. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. See Note 6 “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our finite and indefinite long-lived assets. ​RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements. ​​37 ​Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk​Interest rate risk:We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.​We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.​Cash equivalents risk:We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $108.6 million.​Foreign currency risk:Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.​We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $228.0 million at December 31, 2022. The year ended December 31, 2022, exchange rates of the Mexican peso, relative to the U.S. dollar, strengthened by approximately 5.2% from December 31, 2021. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, would be approximately $20.7 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations. ​​38 ​",2023-12-30 21:18:55.029683
898173,ORLY,O REILLY AUTOMOTIVE INC,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.

Actual results may materially differ from anticipated results described or implied in these forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW We are one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional installer service equipment. On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck’s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray’s Discount Auto Parts. We view the following factors to be the key drivers of current and future demand for the products we sell: Number of miles driven and number of registered vehicles – the total number of miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. The long-term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade. Since 1998, the total number of miles driven in the United States has increased at an annual rate of approximately 1.6%. The total number of vehicles on the road has increased from 197 million registered light vehicles in 1998 to 241 million in 2007. Total number of miles driven remained relatively unchanged in 2007 and declined by 3.6% in 2008, as many consumers responded to rising fuel prices and other economic constraints in part by curtailing automobile usage. We believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and expected decrease in 2009 is a short-term trend and that long-term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road. Average vehicle age – changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products. As the average age of a vehicle increases, the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes, belts, hoses, batteries, and filters. The sales of these products are a key component of our business. The average age of the vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 8.9 years for passenger cars and 8.3 years for light trucks in 1998 to 10.4 and 9.0 years, respectively, in 2007. Based on the dramatic decrease in the sale of new cars and light trucks in 2008, and the expected decrease in 2009, we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue. Unperformed maintenance – according to estimates compiled by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the United States totaled $60 billion for 2007. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2007 and 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance. Product quality differentiation – we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good”, “better”, and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe 25 that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK, one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O’Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. To fund the transaction, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined Company going forward. The results of CSK’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. At the date of the acquisition, CSK had 1,342 stores in 22 states, operating under four brand names: Checker Auto Parts, Schuck’s Auto Supply, Kragen Auto Parts and Murray’s Discount Auto Parts. This added stores in twelve new states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and a number of new markets in states where O’Reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition. As of December 31, 2008, we had converted 51 CSK stores to O’Reilly brands, merged 35 CSK stores with existing O’Reilly locations, closed six CSK stores and opened four new CSK stores. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated: Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 54.5 55.6 55.9 Gross profit 45.5 44.4 44.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36.1 32.3 31.7 Operating income 9.4 12.1 12.4 Debt prepayment costs (0.2 ) — — Interim facility commitment fee (0.1 ) — — Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Interest income 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other income, net — 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 8.5 12.2 12.4 Provision for income taxes 3.3 4.5 4.6 Net income 5.2 % 7.7 % 7.8 % 26 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, from $2.52 billion in 2007 to $3.58 billion in 2008, due to the acquisition of 1,342 CSK stores and the addition of 150 net new O’Reilly stores opened during 2008. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008: Increase/(Decrease) inSales For theYear EndedDecember 31,2008,compared tothe sameperiod in2007 (in millions) O’Reilly stores: Comparable store sales $ 65.0 Stores opened throughout 2007, excluding sales for stores open at least one year that are included in that are included in comparable store sales 92.3 Sales of stores opened in 2008 61.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members (1.1 ) CSK stores: 836.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,054.2 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products in most stores, targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase in 2008 was less than the prior year’s increase of 3.7% and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the CSK acquisition. The external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income resulting from inflation, declining home and investment asset values, higher gas prices in early 2008, increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the US economy. Comparable store sales for O’Reilly stores, including CSK stores after conversion to the O’Reilly brand, but excluding the acquired, yet-to-be-converted CSK stores, increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for acquired CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of those stores’ sales since the July 11, 2008 acquisition by O’Reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when CSK’s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. We expect future sales growth as the CSK stores are converted to the O’Reilly dual market strategy. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. The following table presents quarterly results for non-store sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable stores sales (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 For the quarter ended: March 31 $ 16 $ 17 $ 16 June 30 19 19 19 September 30 21 18 18 December 31 20 16 16 For the year ended December 31: $ 76 $ 70 $ 69 Gross profit increased $507.5 million, or 45%, from $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007 to $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of CSK, the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements. We improved our product mix by 27 continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing O’Reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to DIY customers (which typically have higher gross margin percentages) and because of market conditions, primarily overall price levels, that are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located. Product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower-cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. We anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate in 2009, with more significant improvements resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions relating to the CSK acquisition. SG&A increased $477 million, or 59%, from $815.3 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007 to $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of CSK and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the CSK store base which has a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, a one-time charge of $9.6 million to align CSK’s vacation policy with the Company’s policy, $5.3 million of non-cash amortization of CSK trade names and trade marks and partial de-leverage of fixed SG&A expenses on low comparable store sales increases. Interest expense increased $22 million, from $4 million (or 0.1% of sales) in 2007 to $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008. The increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset-based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the CSK acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs. Other one-time charges were incurred in 2008 of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $114 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate). The increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of CSK and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired CSK stores are located. The increase is also attributable to a one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount $3.1 million relating to the acquisition. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income decreased $7.8 million from $194.0 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales) to $186.2 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales). Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.19 per share in 2008 to $1.48 per share on 125.4 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.67 per share in 2007 on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of CSK. 28 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Sales increased $239 million, or 10.5%, from $2.28 billion in 2006 to $2.52 billion in 2007, due to 190 net additional stores opened during 2007 which contributed $72.5 million to the sales increase, a full year of sales for stores opened throughout 2006 adding $83.5 million and a 3.7% increase in same-store sales for stores open at least one year providing $82.6 million of the sales increase. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores are the result of superior inventory availability, offering a broader selection of products in most stores, an increased promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. The same store sales increase in 2007 of 3.7% was greater than the prior year’s increase of 3.3%, but below our historical results. The decrease from historical trends is the result of challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2006 and 2007. The external macroeconomic factors, which we believe negatively impacted our sales, were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income as a result of increased interest rates and higher energy costs. Consumers also encountered higher gas prices, which resulted in annual miles driven, a key driver of demand for our products, remaining flat in comparison to the long-term trend of annual increases. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. Increase inSales For theYear EndedDecember 31,2007compared tothe sameperiod in2006 (in millions) O’Reilly stores: Comparable store sales $ 82.6 Stores opened throughout 2006, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 83.5 Sales of stores opened in 2007 72.5 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members 0.5 Total increase in sales $ 239.1 Gross profit increased $113.7 million, or 11.3%, from $1.01 billion (44.1% of sales) in 2006 to $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007, primarily due to the increase in sales resulting from a larger number of stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of improvements in product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system efficiencies. Improvements in product mix were the result of strategies which differentiated our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Product acquisition cost improved due to increased imports from lower cost providers in foreign countries as well as improved negotiating leverage with our vendors resulting from our increased purchasing power. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. We anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate throughout 2008. SG&A increased $90.9 million, or 12.6%, from $724.4 million (31.7% of sales) in 2006 to $815.3 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007. The increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased salaries and benefits, rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to support the increased level of our operations. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was the result of increased store salaries primarily driven by the timing of new store openings, higher advertising costs, increased depreciation expense primarily driven by investment in new store technology and increased stock compensation expense. Other income, net, increased by $2.4 million from ($0.1) million in 2006 to $2.3 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to decreased interest expense on long-term debt resulting from a reduction in the interest rate on long-term debt as well as increased interest income derived from a higher than average cash balance. Provision for income taxes increased from $104.2 million in 2006 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $113.5 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate). The increase in the dollar amount was due to the increase of income before income taxes. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $15.9 million from $178.1 million in 2006 (7.8% of sales) to $194.0 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales). Diluted earnings per share increased $0.12 per share in 2007 to $1.67 per share on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.55 per share in 2006 in 115.1 million diluted shares outstanding. 29 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $298.5 million in 2008, $299.4 million in 2007 and $185.9 million in 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was consistent with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and a one-time non-cash charge of $9.6 million to align, where possible, CSK’s vacation policy with the Company’s policy. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. The average per-store inventory for core O’Reilly stores increased to $489,000 as of December 31, 2008, from $482,000 as of December 31, 2007. CSK store’s average per-store inventory increased from $417,000 at the date of acquisition, to $461,000 as of December 31, 2008. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due to increased net income and a reduction in net inventory investment. The reduction in net inventory investment is the result of reductions in our per-store inventory levels and our ongoing effort to extend terms with our vendors. Reductions in our per-store inventory levels are driven by our continued optimization of inventory selection at our stores and our ability to efficiently deploy inventory throughout our distribution network. Net cash used in investing activities was $367.6 million in 2008, $300.3 million in 2007 and $225.2 million in 2006. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition of CSK. Capital expenditures were $341.7 million in 2008, $282.7 million in 2007 and $228.9 million in 2006. The increase in capital expenditures in 2008 was the result of the July 11, 2008 purchase of properties previously leased under our synthetic lease facility in conjunction with the financing of the acquisition of CSK, the addition of a distribution center facility in Lubbock, Texas, cash paid in the construction of a distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina planned to open in 2009 and capital investments made in the initial stage of our integration of the operations of CSK. The 2008 increase in capital expenditures from these items was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction. We opened 150, 190 and 170 net stores in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to increases in capital expenditures resulting from our increased number of new stores, store relocations, enhancements in existing store technology and the purchase of $21.7 million of CSK shares. These expenditures were primarily related to the opening of new stores and distribution centers, as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing stores. Our plan for the integration of the CSK acquisition and our continuing store expansion program will require significant capital expenditures and working capital investments in 2009. Total capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to range from $420 million to $470 million. The CSK integration plan will require capital expenditures for the planned addition of facilities to enhance distribution infrastructure and the conversion of acquired stores to the O’Reilly brand. Costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores include investments in store computer systems, signage, fixtures, interior and exterior renovation, and delivery vehicles. The estimated conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately $135,000. Additionally, our 2009 growth plans call for approximately 150 new stores and the addition of a distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. We plan to finance our expansion program through cash expected to be provided from operating activities and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.8 million in 2008, $18.6 million in 2007 and $37.8 million in 2006. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 is primarily the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset-based credit facility partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the CSK acquisition, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in 2007 versus 2006 is due to net repayments of long-term debt. On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The ABL Credit Facility is comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (FILO tranche). As part of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company has pledged virtually all of its assets as collateral and is subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant. On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the ABL Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. We believe 30 that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2008, our borrowing base was $1.124 billion, of which we had borrowed $614.2 million. Borrowings under the tranche A revolver bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.50% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.75% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%. Fees related to unused capacity under the ABL Credit Facility are assessed at a rate of 0.5% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company (“BBT”), Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”) and SunTrust Bank (“SunTrust”). We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $450 million of our debt that is outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008. We are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt, which may exist under the ABL Credit Facility plus an applicable margin under the terms of the ABL Credit Facility. The counterparties, transaction dates, effective dates, applicable notional amounts, effective index rates and maturity dates of each of the interest rate swap transactions are included in the table below: Counterparty TransactionDate EffectiveDate Notionalamount (inthousands) Effectiveindexrate Spread atDecember 31,2008 EffectiveInterest RateatDecember 31,2008 Maturitydate BBT 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 $ 100,000 3.425 % 3.75 % 7.175 % 8/1/2010 SunTrust 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 25,000 3.830 3.75 7.58 8/1/2011 BA 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 75,000 3.830 2.50 6.330 8/1/2011 SunTrust 7/24/2008 8/1/2008 50,000 3.830 2.50 6.330 8/1/2011 BBT 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 2.990 2.50 5.490 10/17/2010 BBT 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 3.010 2.50 5.510 10/17/2010 BA 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 3.050 2.50 5.550 10/17/2010 SunTrust 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 25,000 2.990 2.50 5.490 10/17/2010 BA 10/14/2008 10/17/2008 50,000 3.560 2.50 6.060 10/17/2011 SunTrust 11/24/2008 11/28/2008 50,000 1.950 2.50 4.450 11/28/2009 $ 450,000 On July 11, 2008, O’Reilly agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, the Notes are exchangeable by the holders only under certain circumstances. Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes are exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): • During any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; • If the Notes have been called for redemption by the Company; or • Upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. Upon exchange of the Notes, we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.9697 shares of our common stock and $60.6061 in cash. 31 The noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term will be approximately $5.5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O’Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O’Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. On September 28, 2007, we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our $49 million Synthetic Operating Lease Facility with a group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and purchase options on the properties. On July 11, 2008, we, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, purchased all the properties included in our Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for $49.3 million, thus terminating the facility. The purchase was funded through borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the ABL Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $55.6 million and $28.6 million were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. • Vendor concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 32 • Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. The long-term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $8.6 million or 2.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. • Accounts Receivable – Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 30% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $1.4 million or 0.4% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. • Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. Our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. The accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007. • Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. 33 We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink were changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2008, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.9 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2008. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill – In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”), we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. The Company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, the Company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have other liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes and self-insurance accruals. Interest payments on our variable rate long-term debt are not included in the financial commitments table. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the financial commitments table due to the absence of scheduled payments. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2009 that are included in current liabilities. In addition, we have commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory as of December 31, 2008. The financial commitments table excludes these commitments because they are cancelable by their terms. Our contractual obligations, as in effect at December 31, 2008, including commitments for future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, are summarized below and are fully disclosed in Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2008 and 2007. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

The provisions of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements, are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (fiscal year 2008 for us). FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (fiscal year 2009 for us). The implementation of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities, effective January 1, 2008, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not anticipate SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. As we elected not to measure any eligible items using the fair value option in accordance with SFAS No. 159, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (revised 2007) (“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) applies to any transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. Where applicable, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is to be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the initial adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact; however, the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on a future business combination could be material and would be evaluated at that time. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS 160”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (“SFAS No. 161”), which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. SFAS No. 161 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 161 beginning with our March 2009 interim consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (“FSP APB 14-1”). FSP APB 14-1 clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited. We will adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 beginning with our March 2009 interim consolidated financial statements; however, we do not anticipate that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Heirarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“SFAS 162”). This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411. “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. At December 31, 2007, we did not have amounts borrowed against our variable rate credit facilities and, as a result, did not have material market risk exposure. Primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of CSK, we have interest rate exposure with respect to the $614 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2008; however, from time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts (“the Swaps”) with a total notional amount of $450 million. The Swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the Swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. The Swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. 36 If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the Swaps. This analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. In the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 37",2023-12-30 21:19:05.163264

We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional installer service equipment. As of December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores in 38 states. Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general. We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Number of U.S. miles driven and number of U.S. registered vehicles: Total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. The long-term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade. Between 1999 and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the United States increased at an annual rate of approximately 1.6%. According to the Department of Transportation, estimated total number of miles driven declined by 3.6% in 2008 and increased slightly in 2009. The relatively flat number of miles driven during 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to lower fuel costs compared to those in 2008, but the overall decrease in miles driven in recent years is a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions. The total number of registered vehicles on the road increased from 201 million light vehicles in 1999 to 242 million in 2008. We believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and the relatively flat number of miles driven in 2009 is a short-term trend, and that long-term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road. 25 Table of Contents Average vehicle age and new light vehicle sales: Changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products. As the average age of a vehicle increases, the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes, belts, hoses, batteries and filters. The sales of these products are a key component of our business. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (“AAIA”) the average age of the United States vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.3 years, respectively, in 2008. Based on estimates provided by the AAIA, new car sales decreased 4.7% between 1999 and 2007 for the light vehicle market; however, sales for the same market decreased 18.5% in 2008. Due to difficult economic conditions and better engineered vehicles, we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue. Unperformed maintenance: According to estimates compiled by the AAIA, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the United States totaled $50 billion for 2008. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance; however, with the reduced number of new car sales, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance is decreasing as people place a higher focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment. Product quality differentiation: We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good, better, and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below: • On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation (“CSK”), one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O’Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. The results of CSK’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. • On July 11, 2008, to fund the CSK acquisition, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined Company going forward. • On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity on December 15, 2025. • On each of July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company (“BBT”), BA, SunTrust Bank (“SunTrust”) and/or Barclays Capital (“Barclays”). We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009. • Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and will continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated: Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 2007 Sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 52.0 54.5 55.6 Gross profit 48.0 45.5 44.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36.9 36.1 32.3 Operating income 11.1 9.4 12.1 Debt prepayment costs — (0.2 ) — Interim facility commitment fee — (0.1 ) — Interest expense (0.9 ) (0.7 ) (0.1 ) Interest income — 0.1 0.1 Other income, net 0.1 — 0.1 Income before income taxes 10.3 8.5 12.2 Provision for income taxes 4.0 3.3 4.5 Net income 6.3 % 5.2 % 7.7 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions): Increase inSales for theYear EndedDecember 31,2009,compared tothe sameperiod in2008 Comparable store sales $ 188.5 Stores opened throughout 2008, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 71.7 Sales of stores opened throughout 2009 72.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members 4.4 Sales in 2008 for stores that have merged or closed (2.1 ) Acquired CSK store sales, excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales (sales after 7/11/2009, the one year anniversary of the acquisition) 935.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,270.5 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O’Reilly systems increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The O’Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 6.6% increase for the core O’Reilly and post conversion Schuck’s stores, a 2.1% increase from the 123 converted Checker stores and a 11.9% decrease in comparable stores sales from the 141 converted Murray’s stores. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. We opened 149 new O’Reilly branded stores and one new Schuck’s store in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008. Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future. 27 Table of Contents Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products. Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of CSK. We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired CSK stores throughout the year. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers. Prior to the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional installer customers. At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY customers. The addition of the acquired CSK stores’ predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional installer. In 2009, core O’Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional installer customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional installer customers. Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional installers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional installers. In addition, we have added our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix. Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new distribution center team members become proficient with the O’Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system. SG&A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of CSK and new stores. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores. These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009. The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate). The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located. The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of sales). Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 137.9 million shares compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125.4 million shares. Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK. These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O’Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized 28 Table of Contents over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. Our year ended December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share data): Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share 2009 2008 2009 2008 Net income and diluted EPS excluding acquisition related charges $ 311,392 $ 205,474 $ 2.26 $ 1.64 Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax — 4,402 — 0.04 Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax — 2,552 — 0.02 Adjustments to tax liabilities — 3,142 — 0.02 Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax — 5,879 — 0.05 Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 3,894 3,267 0.03 0.03 Net income and diluted EPS $ 307,498 $ 186,232 $ 2.23 $ 1.48 The acquisition-related adjustment to EPS in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s ongoing core operations. Management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, from $2.52 billion in 2007 to $3.58 billion in 2008, due to the acquisition of 1,342 CSK stores and the addition of 150 net new O’Reilly stores opened during 2008. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the YearEnded December 31, 2008,compared to the same period in2007 Comparable store sales – O’Reilly stores $ 65.0 Stores opened throughout 2007, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 92.3 Sales of stores opened through 2008 61.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members (1.1 ) Acquired CSK stores 836.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,054.2 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products in most stores, targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase in 2008 was less than the prior year’s increase of 3.7% and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the CSK acquisition. The external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers’ discretionary income resulting from inflation, declining home and investment asset values, higher gas prices in early 2008, increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the US economy. 29 Table of Contents Comparable store sales for O’Reilly stores, including CSK stores after conversion to the O’Reilly brand, but excluding the acquired, yet-to-be-converted CSK stores, increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for acquired CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of those stores’ sales since the July 11, 2008 acquisition by O’Reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when CSK’s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. We expect future sales growth as the CSK stores are converted to the O’Reilly dual market strategy. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. Gross profit increased $508 million, or 45%, from $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007 to $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of CSK, the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing O’Reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to DIY customers (which typically have higher gross margin percentages) and because of market conditions, primarily overall price levels, which are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located. Product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower-cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. SG&A increased $477 million, or 59%, from $815 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007 to $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of CSK and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the CSK store base which has a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, a one-time charge of $9.6 million to align CSK’s vacation policy with the Company’s policy, $5.3 million of non-cash amortization of CSK trade names and trademarks and partial de-leverage of fixed SG&A expenses on low comparable store sales increases. Interest expense increased $22 million, from $4 million (or 0.1% of sales) in 2007 to $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008. The increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset-based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the CSK acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs. Other one-time charges were incurred in 2008 of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $114 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate). The increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of CSK and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired CSK stores are located. The increase is also attributable to a one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount $3.1 million relating to the acquisition. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income decreased $8 million from $194 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales) to $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales). Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.19 per share in 2008 to $1.48 per share on 125.4 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.67 per share in 2007 on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of CSK. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in thousands): Year Ended Liquidity and Related Ratios December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Percentage Change Current assets $ 2,227 $ 1,875 18.8 % Quick assets (1) 198 197 0.5 % Current liabilities 1,231 1,054 16.8 % Working capital (2) 995 822 21.0 % Total debt 791 733 7.9 % Total equity 2,686 2,282 17.7 % Current ratio (3) 1.81:1 1.78:1 1.7 % Quick ratio (4) 0.25:1 0.29:1 (13.8 )% Debt to equity (5) 0.29 0.32 (9.4 )% Year Ended Liquidity December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 285,200 $ 298,542 $ 299,418 Investing activities (410,661 ) (367,597 ) (300,318 ) Financing activities 121,095 52,801 18,552 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,366 ) $ (16,254 ) $ 17,652 (1) Quick assets includes cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders’ equity. Liquidity and Related Ratios Current assets increased 19% from 2008 to 2009, primarily driven by increased investment in inventory as part of the process to properly align the acquired CSK stores with O’Reilly branded stores’ inventory levels and selection. Current liabilities increased 17% from 2008 to 2009, primarily attributable to the presentation of our acquired 6 3/4% Exchangeable Notes as short-term debt, due to the Noteholders’ right to require our repurchase of the Notes in 2010, and an increase in accounts payable stemming from our increased inventory investment. Total working capital increased 21% from 2008 to 2009, principally as a result of our investment in inventory, offset by the related increase in accounts payable as discussed above. Total debt increased 8% and total equity increased 18% from 2008 to 2009. The increase in debt is primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels under our ABL Facility to support the integration and conversion of CSK. The increase in total equity is principally due to a 23% increase in retained earnings resulting from net income in 2009 and an increase in additional paid-in capital of 10% primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million in 2009, $299 million in 2008 and $299 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009, which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was flat with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and a one-time non-cash charge of $9.6 million to align, where possible, CSK’s vacation policy with the Company’s policy. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The increases in net inventory investment in 2008 and 2009 were the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. The average per-store inventory for core O’Reilly stores increased to $498,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $489,000 as of December 31, 2008. Nonconverted CSK store’s average per-store inventory increased to $595,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $461,000 as of December 31, 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $411 million in 2009, $368 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O’Reilly Brand and additional distribution centers. Capital expenditures were $415 million in 2009, $342 million in 31 Table of Contents 2008, and $283 million in 2007. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008, was due to the purchase of two distribution center facilities and land for an additional distribution center in our western markets to enhance the distribution infrastructure, the conversion of 354 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition and in the integration of CSK, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction. We opened 150, 150, and 190 net stores in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2010, we plan to open 150 new stores, convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems, open three new distribution centers in the west, relocate and convert an existing acquired CSK distribution center to O’Reilly systems and convert an existing acquired CSK distribution center to O’Reilly systems. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Capital costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores include investments in store computer systems, signage, fixtures, interior and exterior renovation, and delivery vehicles. The average estimated capital conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately $135,000. Total capital expenditures in 2010 are expected to range from $400 million to $450 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $121 million in 2009, $53 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2007. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was the result of a reduction in payments on long term debt in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relating to the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK in 2008 and an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans along with the increase in the associated tax benefit from the exercises partially offset by reduced borrowings under our asset-based credit facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which was partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the CSK acquisition, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK. Sources of Liquidity Our current business strategy requires capital to open new stores, convert acquired CSK stores, expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our ABL Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our Credit Agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2010, we plan to open 150 new stores and open three new distribution centers in our Western markets. We also plan to relocate an existing acquired CSK distribution center in Northern California to a larger facility and plan to convert our acquired Phoenix distribution center to O’Reilly systems. In addition, we plan to convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O’Reilly systems in 2010. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, if our liquidity is insufficient, we may be forced to limit our planned expansion in 2010. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Credit Facility On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The ABL Credit Facility is comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (FILO tranche). On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the ABL Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $679 million and $614 million, respectively. The available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by stand-by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $72 million and $56 million, respectively, and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the credit facility was $445 million and $454 million, respectively. As part of the Credit Agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we are subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied on December 31, 2009 and 2008. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken; these actions include, but are not limited to, the summarized items below: 32 Table of Contents • termination of credit extensions; • any outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest could become immediately payable; • cash collateralization of all letter of credit obligations; and/or • litigation from lenders. Borrowings under the tranche A revolver bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.25% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 1.25%. Fees related to unused capacity under the ABL Credit Facility are assessed at a rate of 0.375% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with BBT, BA, SunTrust and/or Barclays. We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008. We are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt, which exists under the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility. The interest rate swap transactions have maturity dates ranging from August 1, 2010, through October 17, 2011. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of $400 million as of December 31, 2009. On January 21, 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with Barclays in the amount of $50 million, reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of $450 million as of that date. Senior Exchangeable Notes On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, the Notes are exchangeable by the holders only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): • during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days; • if we have called the Notes for redemption; or • upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. Upon exchange of the Notes, we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.9697 shares of our common stock and $60.6061 in cash. The incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2009, however the incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the impact would have been antidilutive. The Noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. 33 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O’Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O’Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. On September 28, 2007, we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our $49 million Synthetic Operating Lease Facility with a group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and purchase options on the properties. On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we purchased all the properties included in our Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for $49.3 million, thus terminating the facility. The purchase was funded through borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, and as a result of the acquisition, we entered into a master lease agreement with ARI Fleet LT (“ARI”), which was originally entered into on March 19, 2001, by CSK. The lease agreement with ARI is for the lease of all of CSK’s delivery and management vehicles, which is accounted for as a capital lease. Under the master agreement, a lease contract is created on each vehicle, with terms typically ranging from 50 to 60 months. Interest expense on the capital lease totaled $0.3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the book value of the ARI master lease agreement was $3.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the ABL Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $72.3 million and $55.6 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 34 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Deferred income taxes, self-insurance accruals, interest payments on our variable rate long-term debt and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “Other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2010, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 6 “Commitments” to the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, through borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility or through future borrowings. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt $ 778,800 $ 100,000 $ — $ 678,800 $ — Payments under interest rate swap agreements 16,646 11,900 4,746 — — Interest rate payments under 6 3 /4% Exchangeable Senior Notes 103,954 6,739 13,000 13,000 71,215 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases 12,327 6,455 4,343 1,202 327 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases 1,501,522 214,087 377,053 278,242 632,140 Other obligations 4,200 600 1,200 1,200 1,200 Purchase obligations 102,556 102,556 — — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,520,005 $ 442,337 $ 400,342 $ 972,444 $ 704,882 We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. • Vendor concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 35 Table of Contents • Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $9.1 million or 1.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. • Accounts Receivable – We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.7 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. • Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. Our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. • Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers. To 36 Table of Contents the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink were changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $1.2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill – We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2009, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine the Company’s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. • Closed Property Reserves – We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $2.3 million or 0.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. • Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations that are being conducted against CSK and litigation commenced against its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK, which was finalized on June 30, 2009. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $2.4 million or 0.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. 37 Table of Contents To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2009 and 2008. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

ASC 810 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. ASC 810 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of ASC 810 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2009, and are applied prospectively. The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued the Derivatives and Hedging Topic (“ASC 815”) of the FASB ASC, which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. ASC 815 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of ASC 815 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. ASC 815 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We have adopted the provisions of ASC 815 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. In May 2008, the FASB issued the Debt with Conversions and Other Options Topic (“ASC 470”) of the FASB ASC, which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent 38 Table of Contents periods. ASC 470 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity if certain criteria are met and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. ASC 470 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited. We adopted the provisions of ASC 470 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009; however, the retrospective adoption of ASC 470 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” to the consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued the Financial Instruments Topic (“ASC 825”) of the FASB ASC. This Topic requires quarterly disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments, and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 825 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued the Subsequent Events Topic (“ASC 855”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 855 incorporates into authoritative accounting literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards. ASC 855 addresses events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements. Under ASC 855, as under current practice, an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose, but not record, the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date. In addition, ASC 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC 855 is effective for interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 855 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. In June 2009, the FASB issued the Generally Accepted Accounting Standards Topic (“ASC 105”) of the FASB ASC. ASC 105 defines the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”), Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”), and related accounting literature. This standard reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure; also included, is relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections. ASC 105 is effective for reporting periods ended after September 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 105 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and our financial statements and related disclosures reflect the newly adopted codification. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) number 2009-05 (“ASU 2009-05”), an update to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic (“ASC 820”). This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using (a) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and/or (b) an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique, consistent with the principles of ASC 820. This update is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. We adopted this update beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009; the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. Primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of CSK, we have interest rate exposure with respect to the $679 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2009; however, from time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, and November 24, 2008, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts (“the Swaps”) with a total notional amount of $450 million. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates by $50 million, to a total notional amount of $400 million. On January 21, 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with Barclays on an additional $50 million of the Company’s outstanding floating rate debt. The Swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the Swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. The Swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the Swaps. This analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. In the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 39 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:19:10.922333

OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional service providers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. As of December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores in 38 states. Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our Company and the retail sector in general. We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance, unemployment and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Number of miles driven: Total miles driven in the U.S., along with changes in the average age of vehicles on the road, heavily influence the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased. According to the Department of Transportation, between 1999 and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the U.S. increased at an average annual rate of approximately 1.6%. In 2008, however, difficult macroeconomic conditions and record high gas prices during the first half of the year led to a decrease in the number of miles driven and in 2009, miles driven remained relatively flat. Through November of 2010, miles driven in the U.S. increased by 0.7% with miles driven increasing each month since March. As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe that annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to increase the demand for our products. 24 Table of Contents Number of U.S. registered vehicles and new light vehicle sales: As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (“AAIA”), the total number of vehicles on the road in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade, with the total number of registered vehicles increasing 18%, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 242 million in 2009. New light vehicle sales, however, have declined over the past decade. Between 2000 and 2007, new car sales in the U.S. decreased by 7%, from 17.4 million in 2000 to 16.2 million vehicles in 2007. Due to the recent difficult macroeconomic environment in the U.S., new light vehicles sales declined by 18% in 2008 to 13.2 million and declined by 21% in 2009 to 10.4 million vehicles, which is the lowest level in the past decade. Based on the current economic environment, we believe new light vehicle sales will remain below historic levels and consumers will continue to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher miles, continuing the trend of an aging vehicle population. Average vehicle age of registered vehicles: As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.6 years in 2009, respectively. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and built vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains, and interiors and exteriors, the decrease in new car sales over the past two years and the consumers’ willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for our products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures which require replacement parts and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles would require. Unperformed maintenance: According to estimates compiled by the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the U.S. totaled $54 billion for 2009 versus $50 billion for 2008. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products, and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions beginning in 2008 contributed to the increased amount of unperformed maintenance in 2009; however, with the reduced number of new car sales and consumers’ increased focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance decreased in 2010, resulting in a strong year in the automotive aftermarket. Unemployment: Challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment. Monthly U.S. unemployment rates for 2010 ranged from 9.4% to 9.9%. We believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. We also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumer’s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits, both of which could negatively impact our business. Product quality differentiation: We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good”, “better”, and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below: • Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and may continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees. O’Reilly and the DOJ have now agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK’s legacy accounting practices. Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, we have recorded a charge of $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and O’Reilly executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement. 25 Table of Contents • On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) originally issued by CSK. The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity. During 2010, all holders of the Notes exercised their right to exchange and on December 21, 2010, the Notes were retired. • In March of 2010, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Acts”). The provisions of the Acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short-term. However, the potential long-term impacts of the Acts to our business and consolidated financial statements, while currently uncertain, are being evaluated by management. We will continue to assess how the Acts apply to us, their effect on our business and how we plan to best meet the stated requirements. • On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure (the “Reorganization”). The Reorganization was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri which did not require a vote of the shareholders. As a result of the Reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (“Old O’Reilly”) was renamed O’Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. • On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) that authorizes us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period. Stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time as we deem appropriate, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, and we may increase or otherwise modify the Repurchase Program at any time without prior notice. • On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2011 4.875% Senior Notes”) in the public market, of which we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are the guarantors and UMB Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) is trustee. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4.875% which is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes mature on July 14, 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facility, pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the closing and issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes, on January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“the Revolver”) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. (“BA”) and Barclays Capital (“Barclays”) and simultaneously retired our existing secured revolving credit facility. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 51.4 52.0 54.5 Gross profit 48.6 48.0 45.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 35.0 36.9 36.1 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.4 0.0 0.0 Operating income 13.2 11.1 9.4 Debt prepayment costs — — (0.2 ) Interim facility commitment fee — — (0.1 ) Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.9 ) (0.7 ) Interest income — — 0.1 Gain on settlement of note receivable 0.2 — — Other income, net 0.1 0.1 — Income before income taxes 12.8 10.3 8.5 Provision for income taxes 5.0 4.0 3.3 Net income 7.8 % 6.3 % 5.2 % 26 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales increased $550 million, or 11%, from $4.85 billion in 2009 to $5.4 billion in 2010. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the YearEnded December 31, 2010,compared to the same periodin 2009 Comparable store sales $ 417 Stores opened throughout 2009, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 56 Sales of stores opened throughout 2010 74 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members 8 Sales in 2009 for stores that have closed (5 ) Total increase in sales $ 550 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010, versus 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values. We believe that the increase in transaction counts is a result of the customer’s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets. The improvement in average ticket value is primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories. Store growth: At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 170 net new stores in 2011 versus 149 net new stores in 2010. Gross profit: Gross profit increased $294 million, or 13%, from $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009 to $2.62 billion (48.6% of sales) in 2010. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers. The improvement in product mix is primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories. Increasing hard part sales are the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retain their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network. Lower product acquisition costs are derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK. The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts. Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflect comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores is the result of the more robust O’Reilly point of sale system (“POS”), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O’Reilly distribution systems. The O’Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales. The reduced leverage on distribution center costs is the result of the additional distribution centers, which have been opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan. New team members in these distribution centers are not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies. We believe that the long term impact of the improved 27 Table of Contents negotiating leverage with our vendors will allow us to generate gross margins at levels comparable to our 2010 full year results going forward, however continued growth in our commercial sales, as a percent of the total sales mix, will continue to pressure our gross margin results in the future. Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG&A increased approximately $100 million, or 6%, from $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009 to $1.89 billion (35.0% of sales) in 2010. The increase in total SG&A dollars is primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels. Operating income: Operating income increased $175 million, or 33%, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) in 2009 to $713 million (13.2% of sales) in 2010. The increase in operating income is the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG&A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 14 “Legal Matters” to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A costs from strong comparable store sales. This full-year operating income as a percentage of sales represents a record high for the Company, and we would anticipate these operating levels to be sustainable. Other income and expense: Interest expense decreased $6 million, from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009 to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2010. The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our secured asset-backed credit facility (“Credit Facility”). Included as a component of “Other income” for the year ended December 31, 2010, is a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased $81 million from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) in 2009 to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) in 2010. The increase in our provision for income taxes is due to the increase in our taxable income. The increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $112 million, or 36%, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) in 2009 to $419 million (7.8% of sales) in 2010. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares compared to $2.23 for the year ended December 31, 2009, on 138 million shares. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year-to-date results include a nonrecurring charge related to the ongoing, legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as well as a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in other income related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK, increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) for the same period in 2009. Adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) for the same period in 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable, increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period in 2009. 28 Table of Contents The table below outlines the impact of the charge and the gain for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Operating income $ 712,776 13.2 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % — — % Adjusted operating income $ 733,676 13.6 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Net income $ 419,373 7.8 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % — — % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (7,215 ) (0.2 )% — — % Adjusted net income $ 433,058 8.0 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.95 $ 2.23 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.15 — Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (0.05 ) — Adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.05 $ 2.23 The financial information presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the CSK note receivable provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The material limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that such measures are not reflective of actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for this limitation by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales: Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the YearEnded December 31, 2009,compared to the same periodin 2008 Comparable store sales $ 189 Stores opened throughout 2008, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 72 Sales of stores opened throughout 2009 73 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members 4 Sales in 2008 for stores that have merged or closed (2 ) Acquired CSK store sales, excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales (sales after 7/11/2009, the one year anniversary of the acquisition) 935 Total increase in sales $ 1,271 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one-to-two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O’Reilly systems increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The O’Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 6.6% increase for the core O’Reilly and post conversion Schuck’s stores, a 2.1% increase from the 123 converted Checker stores and a 11.9% decrease in comparable 29 Table of Contents stores sales from the 141 converted Murray’s stores. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009, versus 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in transaction counts, while average ticket remained flat with the prior year. The flat average ticket value was attributable to more complex and costly repair parts, consistent with ongoing industry trends offset by competitive price reductions in the acquired CSK stores and the addition of a wider assortment of entry level products in those stores. Store growth: We opened 149 new O’Reilly branded stores and one new Schuck’s store in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008. Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future. Gross profit: Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products. Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of CSK. We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired CSK stores throughout the year. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store’s market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers. Prior to the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional service provider customers. At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY customers. The addition of the acquired CSK stores’ predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional service provider. In 2009, core O’Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional service provider customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional service provider customers. Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional service providers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional service providers. In addition, we have added our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix. Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers (“DC”) in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new DC team members become proficient with the O’Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system. Selling, general and administrative expense: SG&A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of CSK and new stores. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O’Reilly store base, and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores. These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. Operating income: Operating income in 2009 increased $202 million, or 60%, from $336 million (or 9.4% of sales) in 2008 to $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) in 2009, representing an increase of 60%. 30 Table of Contents Interest expense: Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009. The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of borrowings under our Credit Facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate). The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located. The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million, or 65%, from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of sales). Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 138 million shares compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125 million shares. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK. These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O’Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. Our year ended December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK’s trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Net income $ 307,498 6.3 % $ 186,232 5.2 % Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax — — % 4,402 0.1 % Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax — — % 2,552 0.1 % Adjustments to tax liabilities — — % 3,142 0.1 % Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax — — % 5,879 0.1 % Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 3,894 0.1 % 3,267 0.1 % Adjusted net income $ 311,392 6.4 % $ 205,474 5.7 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.23 $ 1.48 Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax — 0.04 Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax — 0.02 Adjustments to tax liabilities — 0.02 Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax — 0.05 Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 0.03 0.03 Adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 2.26 $ 1.64 The acquisition-related adjustments to EPS in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company’s ongoing core operations. Management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this 31 Table of Contents non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions): Year Ended Liquidity and Related Ratios December 31,2010 December 31,2009 PercentageChange Current assets $ 2,301 $ 2,227 3.3 % Quick assets (1) 213 198 7.6 % Current liabilities 1,229 1,219 0.8 % Working capital (2) 1,072 1,008 6.3 % Total debt 359 791 (54.6 )% Total equity $ 3,210 $ 2,686 19.5 % Current ratio (3) 1.87:1 1.83:1 2.2 % Quick ratio (4) 0.23:1 0.26:1 (11.5 )% Debt to equity (5) 0.11 0.29 (62.1 )% Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio (6) 1.6:1 2.4:1 (33.3 )% Year Ended Liquidity December 31,2010 December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 703,687 $ 285,200 $ 298,542 Investing activities (351,277 ) (410,661 ) (367,597 ) Financing activities (349,624 ) 121,095 52,801 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,786 $ (4,366 ) $ (16,254 ) (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders’ equity. (6) Adjusted debt is calculated as the sum of debt, letters of credit and six-times rent, less the premium on exchangeable notes. Adjusted EBITDAR is calculated as the sum of net income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rent expense and stock option compensation expense, less the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of the CSK note receivable, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Liquidity and related ratios: Our working capital increased 6% from 2009 to 2010, primarily driven by an increased investment in hard parts inventories in the acquired CSK stores as we continue to grow and expand the professional service provider business in those markets as well as the additional net inventory investment required by our new store growth. Total debt decreased 55% and total equity increased 20% from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in total debt was driven by strong cash flow from operations which allowed us to substantially pay down the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. The increase in total equity was due to increased retained earnings resulting from strong net income in 2010 and an increase in additional paid-in capital, primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits as well as the impact of share based compensation. Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $704 million in 2010, $285 million in 2009 and $299 million in 2008. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, gain/loss on property and equipment, deferred income taxes and stock based compensation charges), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the 32 Table of Contents inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores. Although our investment in net inventory decreased year over year in 2010, duplicative and excess inventory levels throughout our distribution network have lead to an increase in per store average inventory. The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.57 million as of December 31, 2010, from $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in other liabilities is principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010 which is expected to be paid in 2011. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009 as discussed above, which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009, from $0.48 million as of December 31, 2008 as we made significant investments in the acquired CSK stores in 2009 to improve the inventory availability. During 2011, we will continue to refine the inventory levels in the acquired CSK stores and will focus on returning excess quantities to vendors where appropriate and selling through the remainder of the excess quantities on hand in the stores. Investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $351 million in 2010, $411 million in 2009 and $368 million in 2008. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable. Capital expenditures were $365 million in 2010, $415 million in 2009, and $342 million in 2008. Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK include the purchase of properties for DCs and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O’Reilly Brand. Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities. The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle the note receivable acquired from CSK. Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O’Reilly Brand and the properties and facilities for the additional DCs. We opened 149 net new stores in 2010 and 150 net new stores in both 2009 and 2008. We plan to open 170 net new stores in 2011. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.4 million to $1.6 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $350 million in 2010, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $121 million in 2009 and $53 million in 2008. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt. The repayments in 2010 were funded by increased cash provided by operating activities as well as decreased capital expenditures compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans and the associated tax benefit from the exercises. Sources of liquidity: Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, to complete the conversions of the acquired CSK stores, expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolver. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolver. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolver will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion secured credit facility arranged by BA (the “Credit Facility”), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This Credit Facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The Credit Facility was comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (“FILO tranche”). On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the credit agreement, under the Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. The terms of the Credit Facility granted us the right to terminate the FILO tranche upon meeting certain requirements, including no events of default and aggregate projected availability under the Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we elected to exercise our right to terminate the FILO tranche. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of the borrowing base available under the Credit Facility was $1.071 billion and $1.196 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million and $679 million, respectively. The available borrowings under the Credit Facility were also reduced by stand-by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $71 million and $72 million, respectively, and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under 33 Table of Contents the Credit Facility was $644 million and $445 million, respectively. As part of the Credit Facility, we had pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we were subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under the tranche A revolver bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.00% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate was equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by BA from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%. Fees related to unused capacity under the Credit Facility were assessed at a rate of 0.50% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the Credit Facility. All outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were repaid in conjunction with the issuance of our 2011 4.875% Senior Notes on January 14, 2011, as further discussed below. On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) arranged by BA and Barclays, which matures in January of 2016. The Revolver includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. Our ability to draw under the revolving facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our ability to certify that the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement are true, correct and complete in all material respects and that no event of default has occurred or would result from the proposed extension of credit. Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we will pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility we entered into on July 11, 2008. 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes: On July 11, 2008, we executed the Third Supplemental Indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”) to the 6 3/4% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”), in which we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of the Notes originally issued by CSK pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December 19, 2005, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 30, 2005, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 27, 2006, by and between CSK Auto Corporation, CSK Auto, Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. On December 31, 2008, and effective as of July 11, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture in order to correct the definition of Exchange Rate in the Third Supplemental Indenture. The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes were exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): • during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; • if the Notes had been called for redemption by us; or • upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. On July 1, 2010, the Notes became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through September 30, 2010, the last trading day of our third quarter, as provided for in the indentures governing the Notes. The Notes became exchangeable as our common stock closed at or above 130% of the Exchange Price (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) for 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on June 30, 2010. As a result, during the exchange period commencing July 1, 2010, and continuing through and including September 30, 2010, for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes held, holders of the Notes could, if they elected, surrender their Notes for exchange. If the Notes were exchanged, we would deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeded the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of approximately 25.97 shares of our common stock and approximately $60.61 in cash. On September 28, 2010, certain holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange $11 million of the principal amount of the Notes. The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on October 27, 2010, and on October 29, 2010, we delivered $11 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 92,855 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation. Concurrently, we retired the $11 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes. On October 1, 2010, the Notes again became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through December 31, 2010. 34 Table of Contents The Noteholders had the option to require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We had the option to redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. On November 15, 2010, we announced our intention to redeem the Notes on December 21, 2010, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. On or prior to December 17, 2010, the remaining holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange the $89 million remaining principal amount of the Notes. The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on December 16, 2010, and on December 21, 2010, we delivered $89 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 939,312 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation. Concurrently, we retired the $89 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes. 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value in the public market, of which certain of our subsidiaries are the guarantors, and UMB is trustee. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4.875% which is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes mature on January 14, 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous secured Credit Facility, to pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes. Prior to October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, equal to the greater of: • 100% of the principal amount thereof; or • the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes) plus 25 basis points. On or after October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, if we undergo a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes), holders of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the repurchase date. Debt covenants: The indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indenture. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The new Revolver contains certain positive and negative debt covenants. These covenants include limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 times from the closing through December 31, 2012, 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times from the closing through maturity. Our consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding standby letters of credit, six times capitalized rent and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. As of January 14, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future. 35 Table of Contents Our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio was 1.6 times and 2.4 times as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Under our current financing plan, we have a target adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 2.0 times to 2.25 times.

We do not, and nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge, the gain from the settlement of the note receivable, and the presentation of EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.3 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O’Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O’Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. We issued stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Credit Facility that reduced our available borrowings. Those letters of credit were issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit had a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $71.2 million and $72.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 36 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “Other liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2011, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, included commitments for future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 6 “Commitments” to the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolver.

At December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $279 million under our Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.50%. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred interest expense of $16 million and $23 million, respectively, as a result of borrowings under our secured Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement. See Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” to the consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolver, which matures in January of 2016. Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility. (3) On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes which are due on January 14, 2021. The estimated annual interest payments for the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are expected to be approximately $24 million. The principal amount and estimated annual interest payments are not included in the above table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. (4) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (5) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded a liability of $41.3 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities”. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. 37 Table of Contents • Vendor concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. • Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $10 million or 1.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Accounts Receivable – We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.8 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. • Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for 38 Table of Contents monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.6 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill – We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2010, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine the Company’s market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. • Closed Property Reserves – We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against CSK and certain of its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $4.3 million or 0.6% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2010 and 2009. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of the new Level 3 guidance is required in 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. We had potential interest rate exposure with respect to the $356 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at December 31, 2010; however, from time to time, we had entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts (“the Swaps”) with a total notional amount of $450 million. The interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with BBT on July 24, 2008, for $100 million matured on August 1, 2010; the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with BBT on October 14, 2008, for $25 million and was scheduled to mature on October 17, 2010, was terminated at our request on September 16, 2010; the interest rate swap transactions we entered into with BBT, BA and/or SunTrust on October 14, 2008, totaling $75 million, matured on October 17, 2010, bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to $250 million as of December 31, 2010. The Swaps represented contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $1.1 million ($0.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the Swaps. This analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. In the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. The interest rate contracts are derivative instruments which have been designated as cash flow hedges. We do not hold or issue derivative financials instruments for trading purposes. All of the interest rate swap transactions that existed as of December 31, 2010, for a total notional amount of $250 million, were terminated at the Company’s request on January 14, 2011, concurrent with the closing and issuance of our 2011 4.875% Senior Notes. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:19:13.612983

OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers and professional service providers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good”, “better”, and “best” alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the “best” quality category of products. Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. As of December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O’Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer’s tendency has been to “trade-down” to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers’ changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum. We have ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. 25 Table of Contents We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. • Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions. Historically, rapid increases in gasoline prices have negatively impacted U.S. total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel. Average gasoline prices increased 7% in 2011, compared to an increase of 18% in 2010. We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and gasoline prices stabilize, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry. • Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (“AAIA”), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 17% over the past decade, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 240 million light vehicles in 2010. New light vehicle registrations, however, have declined 34% over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2000 to 11 million registrations in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales of total light vehicles in the U.S. was 13 million, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed, however total sales of light vehicles has remained below historical rates for the past three years, contributing to an aging U.S. vehicle population. As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 19% over the past decade, from 8.9 years in 2000 to 10.6 years in 2010. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors; depressed new car sales over the past three years at below historical levels; and the consumer’s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population. • Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs. We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer’s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket. We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: • On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million on August 5, 2011, and an additional $500 million on November 16, 2011, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $1.5 billion. The additional $500 million authorizations are effective for three-year periods, expiring on August 5, 2014, and November 16, 2014. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As of February 28, 2012, we had repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1 billion under this program. • On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.875% Senior Notes due 2021”) in the public market with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee, which were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 were issued at 99.297% of their face value and will mature on January 14, 2021. The proceeds from the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 issuance were used to repay all of our outstanding borrowings under our existing secured asset-based revolving credit facility 26 Table of Contents (the “ABL Credit Facility”), pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) arranged by Bank of America (“BA”) and Barclays Capital to provide additional financial flexibility. All remaining debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility, totaling $22 million were written off, and all interest rate swap agreements related to notional amounts under the ABL Credit Facility, with a carrying value of $4 million, were terminated and charged to earnings as one-time, non-recurring items upon the repayment and retirement of the ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011, which is included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. • On September 9, 2011, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility with BA, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. • On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.625% Senior Notes due 2021”) in the public market with UMB as trustee, which were guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were issued at 99.826% of their face value and will mature on September 15, 2021. The proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 51.0 51.4 52.0 Gross profit 49.0 48.6 48.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.1 35.0 36.9 Former CSK officer clawback (0.1 ) — — Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge — 0.4 — Operating income 15.0 13.2 11.1 Interest expense (0.5 ) (0.7 ) (0.9 ) Interest income 0.1 — — Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs (0.4 ) — — Termination of interest rate swap agreements (0.1 ) — — Gain on settlement of note receivable — 0.2 — Other income, net — 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 14.1 12.8 10.3 Provision for income taxes 5.3 5.0 4.0 Net income 8.8 % 7.8 % 6.3 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $391 million to $5.79 billion from $5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7.2%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6% and 8.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. 27 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the year endedDecember 31, 2011, compared to thesame period in 2010 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 241 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2010, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 70 Sales in 2010 for stores that have closed (13 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2011 82 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team member sales 11 Total increase in sales $ 391 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories. During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts. We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 180 net, new stores in 2012. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) from $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales. Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets. The improved shrinkage is driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O’Reilly point-of-sale system (“POS”), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O’Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010. The O’Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Distribution center efficiencies are the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs. Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets are growing at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy. Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business. 28 Table of Contents Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) from $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22%. The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below – see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy CSK DOJ investigation (discussed in detail below – see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $51 million (or 0.9% of sales), from $23 million (or 0.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118%. The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period. In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below). Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) investigation of CSK, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $508 million (or 8.8% of sales), from $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 21%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26% to $3.71 on 137 million shares from $2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period one year ago. The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $0.19. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O’Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This “clawback” amount was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in “Other income (expense)” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in “Other income (expense)” of $12 million ($7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK’s pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. We accrued $21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) among the DOJ, CSK and O’Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK. The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation was included in “Operating income” on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18% to $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) from $734 million (or 13.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21% to $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) from $433 million (or 8.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2011, increased 25% to $3.81 from $3.05 for the same period one year ago. 29 Table of Contents The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the new financing transactions, the former CSK officer clawback, the legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge, as well as the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales GAAP Operating income $ 866,766 15.0 % $ 712,776 13.2 % Former CSK officer clawback (2,798 ) (0.1 )% — — % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge — — % 20,900 0.4 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 863,968 14.9 % $ 733,676 13.6 % GAAP net income $ 507,673 8.8 % $ 419,373 7.8 % Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs, net of tax 13,458 0.2 % — — % Termination of interest rate swap agreements, net of tax 2,637 — % — — % Former CSK officer clawback, net of tax (1,741 ) — % — — % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge — — % 20,900 0.4 % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax — — % (7,215 ) (0.2 )% Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 522,027 9.0 % $ 433,058 8.0 % GAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 3.71 $ 2.95 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs, net of tax 0.09 — Termination of interest rate swap agreements, net of tax 0.02 — Former CSK DOJ officer clawback, net of tax (0.01 ) — Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge — 0.15 Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax — (0.05 ) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.81 $ 3.05 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution 136,983 141,992 The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased $550 million to $5.4 billion from $4.85 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11%. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 8.8% and 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the year endedDecember 31, 2010, compared to thesame period in 2009 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 417 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2009, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 56 Sales in 2009 for stores that have closed (5 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2010 74 Non-store sales: Including sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team member sales 8 Total increase in sales $ 550 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values. We believe that the increase in transaction counts was a result of the customer’s focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets. The improvement in average ticket value was primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories. We opened 149 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 142 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) from $2.33 billion (or 48.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories. Increasing hard part sales were the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retained their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network. Lower product acquisition costs were derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK. The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarters of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts. Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflected comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores was the result of the more robust O’Reilly point of sale system (“POS”), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O’Reilly distribution systems. The O’Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales. The reduced leverage on distribution center costs was the result of the additional distribution centers, which were opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan. New Team Members in these distribution centers were not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies. 31 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) from $1.79 billion (or 36.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for Team Members resulting from strong comparable store sales. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels. Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) from $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 33%. The increase in operating income was the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG&A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 “Legal Matters” to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A costs from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 13%. The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Included as a component of “Other income” for the year ended December 31, 2010, was a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 43%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) from $307 million (or 6.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 36%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares from $2.23 on 138 million shares for the same period one year ago. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included charges related to the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK discussed above, as well as the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above. Adjusted operating income increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales), for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales), for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales GAAP Operating income $ 712,776 13.2 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % — — % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 733,676 13.6 % $ 537,619 11.1 % GAAP net income $ 419,373 7.8 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % — — % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (7,215 ) (0.2 )% — — % Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 433,058 8.0 % $ 307,498 6.3 % GAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 2.95 $ 2.23 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.15 — Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (0.05 ) — Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.05 $ 2.23 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution 141,992 137,882 The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the 32 Table of Contents acquisition of CSK provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in millions): December 31, December 31, Percentage Liquidity and Related Ratios 2011 2010 Change Current assets $ 2,608 $ 2,301 13 % Quick assets (1) 565 213 165 % Current liabilities 1,580 1,229 29 % Working capital (2) 1,028 1,072 (4 )% Total debt 798 359 122 % Total equity 2,845 3,210 (11 )% Current ratio (3) 1.65:1 1.87:1 (12 )% Quick ratio (4) 0.39:1 0.23:1 70 % Debt to equity (5) 0.28:1 0.11:1 155 % (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders’ equity. Total debt increased 122% and total equity decreased 11% from 2010 to 2011. The increase in total debt was attributable the issuance of our senior notes during 2011, partially offset by the repayment of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related excess tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands): Year Ended Liquidity December 31,2011 December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 1,118,991 $ 703,687 $ 285,200 Investing activities (319,653 ) (351,277 ) (410,661 ) Financing activities (467,507 ) (349,624 ) 121,095 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 331,831 $ 2,786 $ (4,366 ) Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation). Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, 33 Table of Contents net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and deferred income taxes), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores. The increase in other liabilities was principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010, which was paid in 2011. Investing activities: The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures were $328 million in 2011, $365 million in 2010 and $415 million in 2009. During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O’Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable. Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK included the purchase of properties for distribution centers (“DC”s) and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O’Reilly Brand. Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities. The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition. We opened 170 net, new stores in 2011, 149 net, new stores in 2010 and 150 net, new stores in 2009. We plan to open 180 net, new stores in 2012. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010. The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt. Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured Revolving Credit Facility arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in “Other income (expense)” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers’ compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $60 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 34 Table of Contents Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.875% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. (“UMB”) as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and costs associated with terminating our existing interest rate swap contracts, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (“4.625% Senior Notes due 2021”) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries (“Subsidiary Guarantors”) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. No minor subsidiaries exist today. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2011. Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.5 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders. We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.86 times and 4.21 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.75 times and 1.57 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing policy, we have targeted an adjusted consolidated leverage ratio range of 2.0 times to 2.25 times. 35 Table of Contents The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 GAAP net income $ 507,673 $ 419,373 Add: Interest expense 28,165 39,273 Rent expense 230,897 226,879 Provision for income taxes 308,100 270,000 Depreciation expense 164,579 154,812 Amortization expense 1,301 6,630 Non-cash share based compensation 20,579 14,947 Gain on settlement of note receivable — (11,639 ) Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs 21,626 — Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge — 20,900 Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR) $ 1,282,920 $ 1,141,175 Interest expense $ 28,165 $ 39,273 Capitalized interest 4,666 5,133 Rent expense 230,897 226,879 Total fixed charges $ 263,728 $ 271,285 Fixed charge coverage ratio 4.86 4.21 GAAP debt $ 797,574 $ 358,704 Stand-by letters of credit 59,917 71,206 Discount on senior notes 3,683 — Six-times rent expense 1,385,382 1,361,274 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 2,246,556 $ 1,791,184 Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio 1.75 1.57 The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O’Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain of our affiliates). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O’Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $60 million and $71 million were outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 36 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 11 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in “Other liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2012, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 797,727 $ 737 $ 477 $ 177 $ 796,336 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 256 77 154 25 — Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 1,650,698 226,381 400,661 297,947 725,709 Other obligations 3,000 600 1,200 1,200 — Self-insurance reserves (3) 116,096 53,155 32,009 15,736 15,196 Construction commitments 41,616 41,616 — — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,609,393 $ 322,566 $ 434,501 $ 315,085 $ 1,537,241 (1) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in January of 2016. On September 9, 2011, we amended the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $660 million, extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Rating Services. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175%. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 14 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a liability of $53 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of “Other liabilities”. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. 37 Table of Contents • Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink – Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. • Accounts Receivable – We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management’s expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. • Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management’s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually on November 30, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2011, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O’Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. • Vendor concessions – We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from 38 Table of Contents vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors’ financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. • Self-Insurance Reserves – We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $11 million or 1.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. • Closed Property Reserves – We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. • Legal Reserves – We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O’Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against certain of CSK’s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. • Taxes – We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. 39 Table of Contents INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2011 and 2010. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques. The updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The application of this guidance affected disclosures only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 was issued to bring the definition of fair value, the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) in line with one another. ASU 2011-04 also enhanced the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels, particularly valuations in Level 3 fair value measurements, and was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore, should not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents In June of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income (“2011-05”). ASU 2011-05 was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and eliminates previous U.S. GAAP guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as part of its statement of changes in shareholders’ equity. With the issuance of ASU 2011-05, companies are now required to report all components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income, which includes components of both OCI and net income, or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income. ASU 2011-05 does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of OCI, or which items are included within total comprehensive income. In December of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 (“2011-12”). ASU 2011-12 defers changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements. No other requirements of ASU 2011-05 were affected by the issuance of ASU 2011-12, including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance with our 2011 financial statements; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In September of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment (“2011-08”). ASU 2011-08 was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill, by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist, before completing the entire impairment test. Under ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The changes under ASU 2011-08 are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either a Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of December 31, 2011, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 30 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $362 million. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:19:14.651767
