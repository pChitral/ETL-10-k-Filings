1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2003,Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 40,2023-12-31 03:11:54.284901
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2014,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales. We also offer other services such as AWS, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 476 million and 470 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts available to us from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.17Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 9, 9, and 10 for 2013, 2012, and 2011. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 74, 76, and 74 for 2013, 2012, and 2011. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as web services, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Critical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions._______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.(4)Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.(5) Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 18Table of ContentsInventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $79 million.GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2013 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2013 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment.Stock-Based CompensationWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $32 million impact on our 2013 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was 27%.We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.19Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. In addition, we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.20Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$5,475 $4,180 $3,903Investing activities(4,276) (3,595) (1,930)Financing activities(539) 2,259 (482)Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.0 billion for 2013, compared to $395 million and $2.1 billion for 2012 and 2011. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow for 2013, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to higher operating cash flows and decreased capital expenditures. The decrease in free cash flow for 2012, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to increased capital expenditures, including a $1.4 billion purchase of property in December 2012, partially offset by higher operating cash flows. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures, and our net income (loss). Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $12.4 billion, $11.4 billion, and $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.6 billion, $5.1 billion, and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan.Cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion, $4.2 billion, and $3.9 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2013, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. The increase in operating cash flow in 2012, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, additions to unearned revenue, and changes in working capital, partially offset by increased tax benefits on excess stock-based compensation deductions. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(4.3) billion, $(3.6) billion, and $(1.9) billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion, $3.8 billion, and $1.8 billion during 2013, 2012, and 2011. In December 2012, we acquired 11 buildings comprising 1.8 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in Seattle, Washington for $1.4 billion. Excluding this acquisition, increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, during all three periods. We expect this trend to continue over time. Capital expenditures included $493 million, $381 million, and $256 million for internal-use software and website development during 2013, 2012, and 2011. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $312 million, $745 million, and $705 million.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(539) million, $2.3 billion, and $(482) million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Cash outflows from financing activities result from common stock repurchases, payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, and repayments of long-term debt. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of long-term debt were $1.0 21Table of Contentsbillion, $588 million, and $444 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $1.9 billion, $802 million, and $753 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, with the increases primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS. We repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $960 million in 2012 and 1.5 million shares of common stock for $277 million in 2011 under the $2.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2010. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $394 million, $3.4 billion, and $177 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. During 2012, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches: $750 million of 0.65% notes due in 2015; $1.0 billion of 1.20% notes due in 2017; and $1.3 billion of 2.50% notes due in 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $78 million, $429 million, and $62 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011.In 2013, 2012, and 2011 we recorded net tax provisions of $161 million, $428 million, and $291 million. Except as required under U.S. tax law, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings. As of December 31, 2013, cash held by foreign subsidiaries was $4.6 billion, which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $2.5 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property were a result of U.S. legislation that expired in December 2013. As such, cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $169 million, $112 million, and $33 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011. As of December 31, 2013, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $275 million and we had approximately $295 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. The U.S. federal research and development credit expired in December 2013. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate lease agreements. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $301 million and $99 million. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some states may restrict our use of those funds. This restriction would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2013. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 9, 9, and 10 for 2013, 2012, and 2011. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.22Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into two segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our Chief Executive Officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net SalesNet sales include product and services sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record. Services sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, digital content subscriptions, and non-retail activities such as AWS, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and services sales. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Net Sales: North America$44,517 $34,813 $26,705International29,935 26,280 21,372Consolidated$74,452 $61,093 $48,077Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America28% 30% 43%International14 23 38Consolidated22 27 41Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America28% 30% 43%International19 27 31Consolidated24 29 37Net Sales Mix: North America60% 57% 56%International40 43 44Consolidated100% 100% 100%Sales grew 22%, 27%, and 41% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(1.3) billion, $(854) million, and $1.1 billion for 2013, 2012, and 2011. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below.North America sales grew 28%, 30%, and 43% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings.International sales grew 14%, 23%, and 38% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(1.3) billion, $(853) million, and $1.1 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales.

We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing placement of fulfillment centers, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.24Table of ContentsNet sales by similar products and services were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Net Sales: North America Media$10,809 $9,189 $7,959Electronics and other general merchandise29,985 23,273 17,315Other (1)3,723 2,351 1,431Total North America$44,517 $34,813 $26,705International Media$10,907 $10,753 $9,820Electronics and other general merchandise18,817 15,355 11,397Other (1)211 172 155Total International$29,935 $26,280 $21,372Consolidated Media$21,716 $19,942 $17,779Electronics and other general merchandise48,802 38,628 28,712Other (1)3,934 2,523 1,586Total consolidated$74,452 $61,093 $48,077Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media18% 15% 16%Electronics and other general merchandise29 34 57Other58 64 73Total North America28 30 43International Media1% 9% 23%Electronics and other general merchandise23 35 55Other22 11 24Total International14 23 38Consolidated Media9% 12% 19%Electronics and other general merchandise26 35 56Other56 59 66Total consolidated22 27 41Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media7% 12% 16%Electronics and other general merchandise27 40 47Other26 15 18Total International19 27 31Consolidated Media12% 14% 16%Electronics and other general merchandise28 36 53Other56 59 66Total consolidated24 29 37Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media29% 33% 37%Electronics and other general merchandise66 63 60Other5 4 3Total consolidated100% 100% 100%___________________(1)Includes sales from non-retail activities, such as AWS sales, which are included in the North America segment, and advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements, which are included in both segments.25Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2011 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation NetOperating Expenses: Cost of sales$54,181 $— $54,181 $45,971 $— $45,971 $37,288 $— $37,288Fulfillment8,585 (294) 8,291 6,419 (212) 6,207 4,576 (133) 4,443Marketing3,133 (88) 3,045 2,408 (61) 2,347 1,630 (39) 1,591Technology and content6,565 (603) 5,962 4,564 (434) 4,130 2,909 (292) 2,617General and administrative1,129 (149) 980 896 (126) 770 658 (93) 565Other operating expense (income), net114 — 114 159 — 159 154 — 154Total operating expenses$73,707 $(1,134) $72,573 $60,417 $(833) $59,584 $47,215 $(557) $46,658Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment34% 34% 40% 40% 58% 58%Marketing30 30 48 47 58 59Technology and content44 44 57 58 68 73General and administrative26 27 36 36 40 46Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment11.5% 11.1% 10.5% 10.2% 9.5% 9.2%Marketing4.2 4.1 3.9 3.8 3.4 3.3Technology and content8.8 8.0 7.5 6.8 6.1 5.4General and administrative1.5 1.3 1.5 1.3 1.4 1.2Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.”Cost of SalesCost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record, including Prime Instant Video, inbound and outbound shipping charges, and packaging supplies. Shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product, digital content, and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, as well as from expansion of digital offerings.Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Gross profit (in millions)$20,271 $15,122 $10,789Gross margin27.2% 24.8% 22.4%Gross margin increased in 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales. Services sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, and non-retail activities such as AWS, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.FulfillmentFulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations 26Table of Contentsand enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary.MarketingWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search programs and our Associates program, payroll and related expenses, and television advertising.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentWe seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure, including AWS, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure.The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, including those associated with our initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, and increased spending on technology infrastructure, including AWS. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure.For 2013, 2012, and 2011, we capitalized $581 million (including $87 million of stock-based compensation), $454 million (including $74 million of stock-based compensation), and $307 million (including $51 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $451 million, $327 million, and $236 million for 2013, 2012, and 2011. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure, other technology, and operating costs incurred to support AWS are included in technology and content.General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation was $1.1 billion, $833 million, and $557 million during 2013, 2012, and 2011. The increase in 2013, 2012, and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees.27Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $114 million, $159 million, and $154 million during 2013, 2012, and 2011, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by the settlement of certain unclaimed property and indemnification claims in Q3 2013.Income from OperationsFor the reasons discussed above, income from operations increased 10% in 2013, decreased 22% in 2012, and decreased 39% in 2011.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $38 million, $40 million, and $61 million during 2013, 2012, and 2011. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.The primary components of our interest expense are related to our long-term debt and capital and financing lease arrangements. Interest expense was $141 million, $92 million, and $65 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011.Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Our other long-term liabilities were $4.2 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Note 7—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(136) million, $(80) million, and $76 million during 2013, 2012, and 2011. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses) on intercompany balances.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $161 million, $428 million, and $291 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011. Our effective tax rate in 2013 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate in 2012 primarily due to the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a decline in the proportion of our losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, and the retroactive extension of the U.S. federal research and development credit, which expired in December 2013. The favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily relates to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. In 2013, we recognized tax benefits for a greater proportion of these losses as compared to 2012. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. In 2012, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate in 2011 primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses of subsidiaries primarily located outside of Europe for which we may not realize a tax benefit. The adverse impact of these losses was partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations. Additionally, our effective tax rate in 2012 was more volatile as compared to 2011 due to the lower level of pre-tax income generated during the year, relative to our tax expense. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also adversely impacted by acquisitions (including integrations), audit developments, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development credit at the end of 2011.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2013, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $275 million and we had approximately $295 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities.28Table of ContentsEquity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(71) million, $(155) million, and $(12) million in 2013, 2012, and 2011.

Our measures of “Free cash flow,” operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development,” which are included in cash flow from investing activities. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flow from operations since purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, are a necessary component of ongoing operations.Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and other leases accounted for as financing arrangements, or cash 29Table of Contentspayments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2013, 2012, and 2011 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$5,475 $4,180 $3,903Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development(3,444) (3,785) (1,811)Free cash flow$2,031 $395 $2,092Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(4,276) $(3,595) $(1,930)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(539) $2,259 $(482)Operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher.Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period.GuidanceWe provided guidance on January 30, 2014, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 30, 2014, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2014 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion, or to grow between 13% and 24% compared with first quarter 2013.•Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(200) million and $200 million, compared to $181 million in first quarter 2013.•This guidance includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.30Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2013 (in millions, except percentages): 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2013Money market funds $5,914 $— $— $— $— $— $5,914 $5,914Weighted average interest rate 0.12% —% —% —% —% —% 0.12% Corporate debt securities 158 267 247 27 19 — 718 741Weighted average interest rate 0.56% 0.70% 1.02% 1.65% 1.62% —% 0.84% U.S. government and agency securities 1,141 544 348 151 25 — 2,209 2,222Weighted average interest rate 0.20% 0.47% 0.98% 1.30% 2.40% —% 0.49% Asset backed securities 25 20 19 — — — 64 65Weighted average interest rate 0.57% 0.72% 1.01% —% —% —% 0.75% Foreign government and agency securities 62 289 351 24 3 — 729 758Weighted average interest rate 0.19% 0.22% 0.35% 0.64% 1.49% —% 0.30% Other securities 7 14 13 2 — — 36 36Weighted average interest rate 0.68% 0.79% 1.10% 1.57% —% —% 0.91% $7,307 $1,134 $978 $204 $47 $— $9,670 Cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities $9,736As of December 31, 2013, we had $3.9 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in three tranches: $750 million of 0.65% notes due in 2015; $1.0 billion of 1.20% notes due in 2017; and $1.3 billion of 2.50% notes due in 2022. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our debt was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2013.31Table of ContentsForeign Exchange RiskDuring 2013, net sales from our International segment accounted for 40% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2013, International segment revenues decreased $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2013, of $5.6 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $280 million, $560 million, and $1.1 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2013, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $55 million, $120 million, and $270 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates.Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2013, our recorded basis in equity investments was $127 million. These investments primarily relate to equity and cost method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.32Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:41.013998
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2015,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as AWS, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 483 million and 476 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information as well as alternative free cash flow measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.18Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 9 for 2014, 2013, and 2012. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 73, 74, and 76 for 2014, 2013, and 2012. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as web services, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Critical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. _______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.(4)Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.(5)Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 19Table of ContentsInventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2014, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $95 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2014, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2014 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment.Stock-Based CompensationWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee classification, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $30 million impact on our 2014 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 27%.We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other 20Table of Contentsconditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, Amazon could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”21Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$6,842 $5,475 $4,180Investing activities(5,065) (4,276) (3,595)Financing activities4,432 (539) 2,259Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.9 billion for 2014, compared to $2.0 billion and $395 million for 2013 and 2012. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow for 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to increased cash capital expenditures partially offset by higher operating cash flows. The increase in free cash flow for 2013, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to higher operating cash flows and decreased cash capital expenditures. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures, including our decision to finance property and equipment under capital leases and other financing arrangements, and our net income (loss). Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $17.4 billion, $12.4 billion, and $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. Cash and cash equivalents also reflects net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2014. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.4 billion, $5.6 billion, and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and were primarily British Pounds, Chinese Yuan, Euros, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 billion, $5.5 billion, and $4.2 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in non-cash charges to net income, including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. The increase in operating cash flow in 2013, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(5.1) billion, $(4.3) billion, and $(3.6) billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012, with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $4.9 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.8 billion during 2014, 2013, and 2012. In December 2012, we acquired 11 buildings comprising 1.8 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in Seattle, Washington for $1.4 billion. Excluding this acquisition, increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, during all three periods. We expect this trend to continue over time. Capital expenditures included $537 million, $493 million, and $381 million for internal-use software and website development during 2014, 2013, and 2012. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $979 million, $312 million, and $745 million.22Table of ContentsAdditionally, in January 2015, we signed an agreement to acquire a technology company for approximately $350 million in cash, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. We expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2015, subject to closing conditions.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.4 billion, $(539) million, and $2.3 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012. Cash outflows from financing activities result from common stock repurchases, principal payments on obligations related to capital and finance leases, and repayments of long-term debt. Principal payments on obligations related to capital leases, finance leases, and repayments of long-term debt were $1.9 billion, $1.0 billion, and $588 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.0 billion, $1.9 billion, and $802 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, with the increases reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend to continue over time. We repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $960 million in 2012 under the $2.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2010. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $6.4 billion, $394 million, and $3.4 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012. During 2014, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044. During 2012, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches maturing in 2015 through 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $6 million, $78 million, and $429 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012.In September 2014, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders that provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2014. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt” for additional information. In 2014, 2013, and 2012 we recorded net tax provisions of $167 million, $161 million, and $428 million. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.6 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $2.5 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2014, U.S. legislation was enacted providing a one year extension of accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2014. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $177 million, $169 million, and $112 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012. As of December 31, 2014, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.9 billion and we had approximately $443 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which expired in 2014. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $450 million and $301 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 9 for 2014, 2013, and 2012. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.23Table of ContentsWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, and borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.24Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into two segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our Chief Executive Officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources.Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, digital content subscriptions, and non-retail activities such as AWS, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Net Sales: North America$55,469 $44,517 $34,813International33,519 29,935 26,280Total consolidated$88,988 $74,452 $61,093Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America25% 28% 30%International12 14 23Total consolidated20 22 27Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of foreign exchange rates: North America25% 28% 30%International14 19 27Total consolidated20 24 29Net Sales Mix: North America62% 60% 57%International38 40 43Total consolidated100% 100% 100%Sales increased 20%, 22%, and 27% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(636) million, $(1.3) billion, and $(854) million for 2014, 2013, and 2012. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 25%, 28%, and 30% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, and AWS, which was partially offset by AWS pricing changes. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. International sales increased 12%, 14%, and 23% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(580) million, $(1.3) billion, and $(853) million in 2014, 2013, and 2012. 25Table of ContentsSupplemental InformationSupplemental information about outbound shipping results is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Outbound Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2)(3)$4,486 $3,097 $2,280Shipping costs (4)(8,709) (6,635) (5,134)Net shipping cost$(4,223) $(3,538) $(2,854)Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue45 % 36 % 47 %Shipping costs31 29 29Net shipping cost19 24 17Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue5.1 % 4.1 % 3.7 %Shipping costs(9.8) (8.9) (8.4)Net shipping cost(4.7)% (4.8)% (4.7)%___________________(1)Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service.(2)Includes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships.(3)Includes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services.(4)Includes sortation and delivery center costs.We expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing placement of fulfillment centers, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.26Table of ContentsWe have aggregated our products and services into groups of similar products and services and provided the supplemental disclosure of net sales (in millions) below. We evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate when a product or service category begins to approach a significant level of net sales. For the periods presented, no individual product or service represented more than 10% of net sales.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.”We recorded charges related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, substantially all of which, $170 million, was recorded during the third quarter of 2014. Cost of SalesCost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital media content where we record revenue gross, including Prime Instant Video, packaging supplies, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including sortation and delivery centers, and related equipment costs. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product, digital media content, and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, as well as from expansion of digital offerings. The increase in 2014 was also impacted by Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs.Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Gross profit$26,236 $20,271 $15,122Gross margin29.5% 27.2% 24.8%Gross margin increased in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to service sales increasing as a percentage of total sales. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, digital content subscriptions, and non-retail activities such as AWS, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. 28Table of ContentsWe believe that income (loss) from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.FulfillmentFulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary.MarketingWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search programs, payroll and related expenses, and television advertising.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentWe seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure, including AWS, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. Digital media content where we record revenue gross, including Prime Instant Video, is included in cost of sales.Technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses.Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure, including AWS, and increases in payroll and related expenses, including those associated with our initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure.For 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation), $581 million (including $87 million of stock-based compensation), and $454 million (including $74 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized 29Table of Contentsamounts was $559 million, $451 million, and $327 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure, other technology, and operating costs incurred to support AWS are included in technology and content.General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation was $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion, and $833 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012. The increase in 2014, 2013, and 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $133 million, $114 million, and $159 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Income from OperationsFor the reasons discussed above, income from operations decreased 76% in 2014, increased 10% in 2013, and decreased 22% in 2012.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $39 million, $38 million, and $40 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.The primary components of our interest expense are related to our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements. Interest expense was $210 million, $141 million, and $92 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012.Our long-term debt was $8.3 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our other long-term liabilities were $7.4 billion and $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Note 7—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(118) million, $(136) million, and $(80) million during 2014, 2013, and 2012. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses).Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $167 million, $161 million, and $428 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012. Our provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments, partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. In 2013, our provision for income taxes was lower than in 2012 primarily due to a decline in the proportion of our losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions, and the 30Table of Contentsretroactive extension in 2013 of the U.S. federal research and development credit to 2012. In 2013, we recognized tax benefits for a greater proportion of losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily due to losses of certain foreign subsidiaries, as compared to 2012. The favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions was primarily related to our European operations. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2014, U.S. legislation was enacted providing a one year extension of accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property and the U.S. federal research and development credit through December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.9 billion and we had approximately $443 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which expired in 2014.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11-Income Taxes” for additional information.Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $37 million, $(71) million, and $(155) million in 2014, 2013, and 2012.

Our measures of “Free cash flow,” operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.We provide multiple measures of free cash flow, and ratios based on them, because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development,” which are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $5,475 $4,180Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development(4,893) (3,444) (3,785)Free cash flow$1,949 $2,031 $395Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(4,276) $(3,595)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(539) $2,259Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $5,475 $4,180Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development(4,893) (3,444) (3,785)Principal repayments of capital lease obligations(1,285) (775) (486)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(135) (5) (20)Free cash flow less lease principal repayments$529 $1,251 $(111)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(4,276) $(3,595)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(539) $2,25932Table of ContentsFree cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been acquired with cash. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $5,475 $4,180Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development(4,893) (3,444) (3,785)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases(4,008) (1,867) (802)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(135) (5) (20)Free cash flow less finance principal lease repayments and capital acquired under capital leases$(2,194) $159 $(427)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(4,276) $(3,595)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(539) $2,259All of these free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flow do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher.Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period.GuidanceWe provided guidance on January 29, 2015, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 29, 2015, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2015 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, or to grow between 6% and 16% compared with first quarter 2014.•Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(450) million and $50 million, compared to $146 million in first quarter 2014.•This guidance includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.33Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, on which we pay interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2014 (in millions, except percentages): 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2014Money market funds $10,718 $— $— $— $— $— $10,718 $10,718Weighted average interest rate 0.09% —% —% —% —% —% 0.09% Corporate debt securities 85 131 154 22 — — 392 401Weighted average interest rate 1.05% 1.05% 1.48% 1.65% —% —% 1.25% U.S. government and agency securities 1,865 342 156 19 1 — 2,383 2,406Weighted average interest rate 0.33% 0.79% 1.11% 1.91% 2.17% —% 0.46% Asset backed securities 19 43 7 — — — 69 69Weighted average interest rate 0.64% 0.95% 1.10% —% —% —% 0.88% Foreign government and agency securities 1 27 49 — — — 77 80Weighted average interest rate 0.04% 0.05% —% —% —% —% 0.02% Other securities 12 10 7 4 — — 33 33Weighted average interest rate 0.48% 1.01% 1.23% 0.57% —% —% 0.81% $12,700 $553 $373 $45 $1 $— $13,672 Cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities $13,707As of December 31, 2014, we had $9.9 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):0.65% Notes due on November 27, 2015$7501.20% Notes due on November 29, 2017$1,0002.50% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2502.60% Notes due on December 5, 2019$1,0003.30% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0003.80% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2504.80% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2504.95% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,50034Table of ContentsThe fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2014.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2014, net sales from our International segment accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally focused websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include British Pounds, Chinese Yuan, Euros, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2014, International segment revenues decreased $580 million in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2014, of $5.4 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $270 million, $535 million, and $1.1 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2014, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $310 million, and $700 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2014, our recorded basis in equity investments was $209 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method and cost-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.35Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:39.824828
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2016,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1 per share. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million and 483 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.18Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 8 for 2015 and 9 for 2014 and 2013. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 77, 73, and 74 for 2015, 2014, and 2013. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Critical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. _______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.(4)Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.(5)Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 19Table of ContentsInventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $115 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the second quarter of 2015, we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from October 1 to April 1. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April 1, 2015, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2015 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment.Stock-Based CompensationWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical forfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $46 million impact on our 2015 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 28% and 27%.We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.20Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”21Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$11,920 $6,842 $5,475Investing activities(6,450) (5,065) (4,276)Financing activities(3,763) 4,432 (539)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $19.8 billion, $17.4 billion, and $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $7.3 billion, $5.4 billion, and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.Cash provided by operating activities was $11.9 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash charges to net income (loss) such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital. The increase in operating cash flow in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in non-cash charges to net income (loss), including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in working capital. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion, $(5.1) billion, and $(4.3) billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, $4.9 billion, and $3.4 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013. This primarily reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million, $537 million, and $493 million for internal-use software and website development in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $795 million, $979 million, and $312 million.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.8) billion, $4.4 billion, and $(539) million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.0 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.7 billion, $4.0 billion, and $1.9 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, with the increases reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $353 million, $6.4 billion, and $394 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. During 2014, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $119 million, $6 million, and $78 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013.22Table of ContentsWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2015. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional information. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net tax provisions of $950 million, $167 million, and $161 million. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $5.8 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $1.5 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million, $177 million, and $169 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion and we had approximately $622 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $285 million and $450 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 8 for 2015 and 9 for 2014 and 2013. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsBeginning in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part 1,“Financial Statements—Note 11—Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, digital content subscriptions, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.2) billion, $(636) million, and $(1.3) billion for 2015, 2014, and 2013. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 25%, 23%, and 26% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. International sales increased 6%, 12%, and 14% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(5.0) billion, $(580) million, and $(1.3) billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such 24Table of Contentsas electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. AWS sales increased 70%, 49%, and 69% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.Segment Operating Income (Loss)Segment operating income (loss) is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Segment Operating Income (Loss) North America$2,751 $1,292 $1,166International(91) (144) 154AWS1,863 660 673The increase in North America segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $30 million, $0, and $7 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013. The decrease in International segment operating loss in absolute dollars in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity, spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates was $278 million, $27 million, and $70 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013. The decrease in International segment operating income (loss) in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. The increase in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. The decrease in AWS segment operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by increased usage. There was a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of $264 million, $41 million, and $38 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013.25Table of ContentsSupplemental InformationSupplemental information about outbound shipping results for our North America and International segments is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Outbound Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2)(3)$6,520 $4,486 $3,097Shipping costs (4)(11,539) (8,709) (6,635)Net shipping cost$(5,019) $(4,223) $(3,538)Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue45 % 45 % 36 %Shipping costs32 31 29Net shipping cost19 19 24Percent of Net Sales (5): Shipping revenue6.5 % 5.3 % 4.3 %Shipping costs(11.6) (10.3) (9.3)Net shipping cost(5.1)% (5.0)% (5.0)%___________________(1)Excludes amounts charged on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service.(2)Includes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships.(3)Includes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services.(4)Includes sortation and delivery center costs.(5)Includes North America and International segment net sales.We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing placement of fulfillment centers, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.26Table of ContentsWe have aggregated our North America and International segments’ products and services into groups of similar products and services and provided the supplemental disclosure of net sales (in millions) below. We evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate when a product or service category begins to approach a significant level of net sales. For the periods presented, no individual product or service represented more than 10% of net sales.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.”In 2014, we recorded charges estimated at $170 million primarily related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, the majority of which was included in the North America segment. Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. The increase in 2014 was also impacted by the expansion of digital offerings and Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.FulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction 28Table of Contentsand fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.MarketingWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, direct sales, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses. Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. Digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross, including Prime Video, are included in cost of sales.We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment, and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services.Technology infrastructure costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS service offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage.The increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services.For 2015, 2014, and 2013, we capitalized $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation), and $581 million (including $87 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million, $559 million, and $451 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013. General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.29Table of ContentsStock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation was $2.1 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.1 billion during 2015, 2014, and 2013. The increase in 2015, 2014, and 2013, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock-based compensation awards granted to existing and new employees.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $171 million, $133 million, and $114 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Income from OperationsFor the reasons discussed above, income from operations increased to $2.2 billion in 2015, from $178 million in 2014 and $745 million in 2013. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $50 million, $39 million, and $38 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $459 million, $210 million, and $141 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt, and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt was $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our other long-term liabilities were $9.9 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(256) million, $(118) million, and $(136) million during 2015, 2014, and 2013. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign-currency gains (losses).Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million, $167 million, and $161 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes in 2014 was higher than in 2013 primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments, partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our European operations. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the U.S. federal research and development credit. As of December 31, 2015, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion and we had 30Table of Contentsapproximately $622 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Income Taxes” for additional information.Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(22) million, $37 million, and $(71) million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, and is primarily related to our investment in LivingSocial. The primary component of this activity during 2014 was our share of a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by LivingSocial during the period.Effect of Foreign Exchange RatesThe effect on our income from operations from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReportedNet sales$112,173 $(5,167) $107,006 $89,624 $(636) $88,988 $75,736 $(1,284) $74,452Operating expenses109,956 (5,183) 104,773 89,466 (656) 88,810 74,962 (1,255) 73,707Income from operations2,217 16 2,233 158 20 178 774 (29) 745___________________(1)Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.(2)Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows, operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net” which is included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$11,920 $6,842 $5,475Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,589) (4,893) (3,444)Free cash flow$7,331 $1,949 $2,031 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(5,065) $(4,276)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,763) $4,432 $(539)31Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Lease Principal RepaymentsFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$11,920 $6,842 $5,475Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,589) (4,893) (3,444)Principal repayments of capital lease obligations(2,462) (1,285) (775)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(121) (135) (5)Free cash flow less lease principal repayments$4,748 $529 $1,251 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(5,065) $(4,276)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,763) $4,432 $(539)Free Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital LeasesFree cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2014, and 2013 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$11,920 $6,842 $5,475Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,589) (4,893) (3,444)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases(4,717) (4,008) (1,867)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(121) (135) (5)Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases$2,493 $(2,194) $159 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(5,065) $(4,276)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,763) $4,432 $(539)All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Operating Expenses, Excluding Stock-Based CompensationOperating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment 32Table of Contentsresults, and therefore, excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher.Effect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period.GuidanceWe provided guidance on January 28, 2016, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 28, 2016, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2016 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $26.5 billion and $29.0 billion, or to grow between 17% and 28% compared with first quarter 2015. •Operating income is expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. •This guidance includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense (income), net. It assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates.33Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages): 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2015Money market funds $8,025 $— $— $— $— $— $8,025 $8,025Weighted-average interest rate 0.21 % — % — % —% —% —% 0.21 % Corporate debt securities 131 172 141 14 11 — 469 477Weighted-average interest rate 1.52 % 1.85 % 1.84 % 0.57% 0.74% —% 1.69 % U.S. government and agency securities 4,487 484 147 31 6 — 5,155 5,167Weighted-average interest rate 0.37 % 1.26 % 1.41 % 1.52% 2.23% —% 0.50 % Asset backed securities 65 39 8 4 — — 116 117Weighted-average interest rate 1.85 % 1.87 % 1.80 % 1.83% —% —% 1.85 % Foreign government and agency securities 1 24 16 1 6 — 48 49Weighted-average interest rate (0.03)% (0.10)% (0.04)% 0.01% 0.04% —% (0.06)% Other securities 15 18 5 3 — — 41 42Weighted-average interest rate 0.64 % 1.33 % 1.17 % 2.23% —% —% 1.12 % $12,724 $737 $317 $53 $23 $— $13,854 Cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities $13,877As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.5 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):1.20% Notes due on November 29, 2017$1,0002.50% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2502.60% Notes due on December 5, 2019$1,0003.30% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0003.80% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2504.80% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2504.95% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,50034Table of ContentsThe fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2015, net sales from our International segment accounted for 33% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2015, International segment revenues decreased by $5.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2015, of $7.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $365 million, $730 million, and $1.5 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2015, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $190 million, $405 million, and $905 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2015, our recorded basis in equity investments was $280 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method and cost-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.35Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:43.892045
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2017,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.18Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million and 497 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” _______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.19Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $130 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 20Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$6,842 $11,920 $16,443Investing activities(5,065) (6,450) (9,876)Financing activities4,432 (3,763) (2,911)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $17.4 billion, $19.8 billion, and $26.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.4 billion, $7.3 billion, and $9.1 billion, as of December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $6.8 billion, $11.9 billion, and $16.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2015, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital. The increase in operating cash flow in 2016, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(5.1) billion, $(6.5) billion, and $(9.9) billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $4.9 billion, $4.6 billion, and $6.7 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $537 million, $528 million, and $417 million for internal-use software and website development in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $979 million, $795 million, and $116 million.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.4 billion, $(3.8) billion, and $(2.9) billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $1.9 billion, $4.2 billion, and $4.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in 2015 primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment on our unsecured senior notes. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.0 billion, $4.7 billion, and $5.7 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $6.4 billion, $353 million, and $621 million in 2014, 21Table of Contents2015, and 2016. During 2014, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $6.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in 2019 through 2044. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $6 million, $119 million, and $829 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016.We had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $495 million of borrowings outstanding under our $500 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2016. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional information. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we recorded net tax provisions of $167 million, $950 million, and $1.4 billion. Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $8.6 billion, which included undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $2.8 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $177 million, $273 million, and $412 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $76 million and we had approximately $608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $285 million and $600 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months, which includes the maturation of $1.0 billion of our unsecured senior notes. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.22Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the first quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-based compensation and “Other operating expense, net” to our segment results, and we conformed prior period segment results to the current presentation. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(636) million, $(5.2) billion, and $(550) million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 23%, 25%, and 25% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. International sales increased 12%, 6%, and 24% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(580) million, $(5.0) billion, and $(489) million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from 23Table of Contentsour shipping offers, sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. AWS sales increased 49%, 70%, and 55% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Operating Income (Loss): North America$360 $1,425 $2,361International(640) (699) (1,283)AWS458 1,507 3,108Total consolidated$178$2,233$4,186Operating income was $178 million, $2.2 billion, and $4.2 billion for 2014, 2015, and 2016. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $0 million, $30 million, and $27 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment capacity and spending on technology infrastructure and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by marketplace sellers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(27) million, $(278) million, and $89 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth.

We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.25Table of ContentsSupplemental information about products and services for our North America and International segments is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Net Sales: North America Media$11,567 $12,483 $13,580Electronics and other general merchandise38,517 50,401 64,887Other (1)750 824 1,318Total North America$50,834$63,708$79,785International Media$10,938 $10,026 $10,631Electronics and other general merchandise22,369 25,196 33,107Other (1)203 196 245Total International$33,510$35,418$43,983Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media7 % 8 % 9%Electronics and other general merchandise28 31 29Other22 10 60Total North America23 25 25International Media— % (8)% 6%Electronics and other general merchandise19 13 31Other(3) (3) 25Total International12 6 24Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America Media7 % 8 % 9%Electronics and other general merchandise29 31 29Other22 10 60Total North America23 26 25International Media2 % 4 % 7%Electronics and other general merchandise21 29 33Other(3) 10 30Total International14 21 26_____________________________(1)Includes sales from non-retail activities, such as certain advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements.26Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Operating Expenses: Cost of sales$62,752 $71,651 $88,265Fulfillment10,766 13,410 17,619Marketing4,332 5,254 7,233Technology and content9,275 12,540 16,085General and administrative1,552 1,747 2,432Other operating expense, net133 171 167Total operating expenses$88,810$104,773$131,801Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales16% 14% 23 %Fulfillment25 25 31Marketing38 21 38Technology and content41 35 28General and administrative37 13 39Other operating expense, net16 28 (2)Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales70.5% 67.0% 64.9 %Fulfillment12.1 12.5 13.0Marketing4.9 4.9 5.3Technology and content10.4 11.7 11.8General and administrative1.7 1.6 1.8Other operating expense, net0.2 0.2 0.1In 2014, we recorded charges estimated at $170 million primarily related to Fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs, the majority of which was included in our North America segment.Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.FulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our 27Table of Contentscustomer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.MarketingWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels and television advertising, as well as payroll and related expenses.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and development of new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure costs. Content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection.We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment.Technology infrastructure costs consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS service offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage.The increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and initiatives to introduce new product and service offerings.For 2014, 2015, and 2016, we capitalized $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation), $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), and $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $559 million, $635 million, and $634 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016. General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2014, 2015, and 2016, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. 28Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense, NetOther operating expense, net was $133 million, $171 million, and $167 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $39 million, $50 million, and $100 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $210 million, $459 million, and $484 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt was $8.2 billion and $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our other long-term liabilities were $9.2 billion and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(118) million, $(256) million, and $90 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation gains (losses).Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $167 million, $950 million, and $1.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We also generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We generated income and losses in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the U.S. federal research and development credit. As of December 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $76 million and we had approximately $608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Income Taxes” for additional information.29Table of ContentsEquity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $37 million, $(22) million, and $(96) million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The primary component of this activity during 2014 was our share of a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by operating losses incurred by LivingSocial during the period. The primary components of this activity during 2015 and 2016 were our equity-method investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net,” which is included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $11,920 $16,443Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,893) (4,589) (6,737)Free cash flow$1,949$7,331$9,706 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(6,450) $(9,876)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(3,763) $(2,911)Free Cash Flow Less Lease Principal RepaymentsFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $11,920 $16,443Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,893) (4,589) (6,737)Principal repayments of capital lease obligations(1,285) (2,462) (3,860)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(135) (121) (147)Free cash flow less lease principal repayments$529 $4,748 $5,699 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(6,450) $(9,876)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(3,763) $(2,911)30Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital LeasesFree cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2015 2016Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$6,842 $11,920 $16,443Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net(4,893) (4,589) (6,737)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases(4,008) (4,717) (5,704)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(135) (121) (147)Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases$(2,194) $2,493 $3,855 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(5,065) $(6,450) $(9,876)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$4,432 $(3,763) $(2,911)All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Effect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Year Ended December 31, 2016 AsReported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2) AsReported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2) AsReported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2)Net sales$88,988 $636 $89,624 $107,006 $5,167 $112,173 $135,987 $550 $136,537Operating expenses88,810 656 89,466 104,773 5,183 109,956 131,801 660 132,461Operating income (loss)178 (20) 158 2,233 (16) 2,217 4,186 (110) 4,076___________________(1)Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.(2)Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.31Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2016 (in millions, except percentages): 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2016Money market funds $11,940 $— $— $— $— $— $11,940 $11,940Weighted-average interest rate 0.21% —% 0.21% Corporate debt securities 1,300 577 156 28 30 — 2,091 2,104Weighted-average interest rate 1.27% 1.58% 1.26 % 0.60 % 2.24% —% 1.36% U.S. government and agency securities 3,545 1,136 88 28 10 — 4,807 4,816Weighted-average interest rate 0.71% 1.20% 1.67 % 1.99 % 2.28% —% 0.85% Asset backed securities 217 84 40 10 — — 351 353Weighted-average interest rate 1.41% 1.52% 1.78 % 2.38 % —% 1.51% Foreign government and agency securities 163 129 39 2 1 — 334 337Weighted-average interest rate 1.10% 0.94% (0.45)% (0.01)% 0.79% —% 0.85% Other securities 59 15 11 4 7 — 96 97Weighted-average interest rate 1.33% 1.67% 1.90 % 2.07 % 2.33% —% 1.56% $17,224 $1,941 $334 $72 $48 $— $19,619 Cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities $19,647As of December 31, 2016, we had $8.8 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):1.20% Notes due on November 29, 2017$1,0002.60% Notes due on December 5, 2019$1,0003.30% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0002.50% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2503.80% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2504.80% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2504.95% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,50032Table of ContentsBased upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2016.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2016, net sales from our International segment accounted for 32% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2016, International segment net sales decreased by $489 million in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2016, of $9.1 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $455 million, $915 million, and $1.8 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2016, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $225 million, $476 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2016, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $467 million. We record our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $242 million of our investments as of December 31, 2016. We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:42.005644
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2018,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our consumer-facing websites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.19Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million and 504 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” _______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.20Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $180 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer 21Table of Contentspricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies — Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted,” is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$12,039 $17,272 $18,434Investing activities(6,450) (9,876) (27,819)Financing activities(3,882) (3,740) 9,860Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $19.8 billion, $26.0 billion, and $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $7.3 billion, $9.1 billion, and $11.1 billion, as of December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.0 billion, $17.3 billion, and $18.4 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2016, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.22Table of ContentsCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion, $(9.9) billion, and $(27.8) billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, $6.7 billion, and $10.1 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $528 million, $417 million, and $311 million for internal-use software and website development in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $795 million, $116 million, and $14.0 billion.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.9) billion, $(3.7) billion, and $9.9 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion, $4.4 billion, and $6.4 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.7 billion, $5.7 billion, and $9.6 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $353 million, $621 million, and $16.2 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay the 1.200% Notes due November 2017, and for general corporate purposes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. We had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $592 million of borrowings outstanding under our $600 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2017. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt” for additional information. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, we recorded net tax provisions of $950 million, $1.4 billion, and $769 million. The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts. As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $9.6 billion.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act extended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million, $412 million, and $957 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with its October 2017 decision against us on state aid, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the European Commission. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers’ compensation obligations, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million and $1.3 billion. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data23Table of Contents—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.24Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market from the date of acquisition. In Q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and “Other operating expense, net” with operating expenses in our presentation of segment results. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Net Sales: North America$63,708 $79,785 $106,110International35,418 43,983 54,297AWS7,880 12,219 17,459Consolidated$107,006 $135,987 $177,866Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America25% 25% 33%International6 24 23AWS70 55 43Consolidated20 27 31Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America26% 25% 33%International21 26 23AWS70 55 43Consolidated26 28 31Net sales mix: North America60% 59% 60%International33 32 30AWS7 9 10Consolidated100% 100% 100%Sales increased 27% and 31% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.2) billion, $(550) million, and $210 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 25% and 33% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and, in 2017, the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.International sales increased 24% and 23% in 2016, and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(5.0) billion, $(489) million, and $138 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. 25Table of ContentsAWS sales increased 55% and 43% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Operating Income (Loss): North America$1,425 $2,361 $2,837International(699) (1,283) (3,062)AWS1,507 3,108 4,331Consolidated$2,233$4,186$4,106Operating income was $2.2 billion, $4.2 billion, and $4.1 billion for 2015, 2016, and 2017. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $30 million, $27 million, and $(4) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. The increase in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $(278) million, $89 million, and $(85) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and sales and marketing expenses and related payroll, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $264 million, $(5) million, and $(53) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017.26Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Operating expenses: Cost of sales$71,651 $88,265 $111,934Fulfillment13,410 17,619 25,249Marketing5,254 7,233 10,069Technology and content12,540 16,085 22,620General and administrative1,747 2,432 3,674Other operating expense, net171 167 214Total operating expenses$104,773$131,801$173,760Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales14% 23 % 27%Fulfillment25 31 43Marketing21 38 39Technology and content35 28 41General and administrative13 39 51Other operating expense, net28 (2) 28Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales67.0% 64.9 % 62.9%Fulfillment12.5 13.0 14.2Marketing4.9 5.3 5.7Technology and content11.7 11.8 12.7General and administrative1.6 1.8 2.1Other operating expense, net0.2 0.1 0.1Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery center and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery center and transportation costs, were $11.5 billion, $16.2 billion, and $21.7 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.27Table of ContentsFulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.MarketingWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, Associates program, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure.For 2015, 2016, and 2017, we capitalized $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation), and $395 million (including $84 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million, $634 million, and $545 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. 28Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense, NetOther operating expense, net was $171 million, $167 million, and $214 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $50 million, $100 million, and $202 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $459 million, $484 million, and $848 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The increase is primarily due to increases in our capital and finance lease arrangements and long-term debt. Our long-term debt was $7.7 billion and $24.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. Our other long-term liabilities were $12.6 billion and $21.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(256) million, $90 million, and $346 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax is not material. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million, $1.4 billion, and $769 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisional favorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments.We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we 29Table of Contentsrecognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. As of December 31, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Income Taxes” for additional information.Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(22) million, $(96) million, and $(4) million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The primary components of this activity during 2015, 2016, and 2017 were our equity-method investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million in 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities. Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$12,039 $17,272 $18,434Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(4,589) (6,737) (10,058)Free cash flow$7,450$10,535$8,376 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(9,876) $(27,819)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,882) $(3,740) $9,86030Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Lease Principal RepaymentsFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$12,039 $17,272 $18,434Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(4,589) (6,737) (10,058)Principal repayments of capital lease obligations(2,462) (3,860) (4,799)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(121) (147) (200)Free cash flow less lease principal repayments$4,867 $6,528 $3,377 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(9,876) $(27,819)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,882) $(3,740) $9,860Free Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital LeasesFree cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2017Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$12,039 $17,272 $18,434Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(4,589) (6,737) (10,058)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases(4,717) (5,704) (9,637)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(121) (147) (200)Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases$2,612 $4,684 $(1,461) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(6,450) $(9,876) $(27,819)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,882) $(3,740) $9,860All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.31Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 1, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2018 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with first quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 330 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $300 million and $1.0 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in first quarter 2017. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.32Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages): 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2017Money market funds $11,343 $— $— $— $— $— $11,343 $11,343Weighted-average interest rate 0.61% 0.61% Corporate debt securities 2,717 868 484 155 25 — 4,249 4,257Weighted-average interest rate 1.79% 2.10% 2.27% 2.23% 2.00% 1.93% U.S. government and agency securities 2,995 1,476 310 54 1 — 4,836 4,823Weighted-average interest rate 1.49% 1.98% 2.06% 2.41% 2.64% 1.69% Asset backed securities 341 273 262 31 — — 907 905Weighted-average interest rate 1.86% 2.29% 2.24% 2.05% 2.11% Foreign government and agency securities 405 216 — — — — 621 620Weighted-average interest rate 1.75% 1.93% 1.81% Other securities 159 99 43 31 — — 332 338Weighted-average interest rate 1.15% 1.84% 2.24% 2.48% 1.62% $17,960 $2,932 $1,099 $271 $26 $— $22,288 Cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities $22,28633Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2017, we had $24.9 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):2.600% Notes due on December 5, 2019$1,0001.900% Notes due on August 21, 2020$1,0003.300% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0002.500% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2502.400% Notes due on February 22, 2023$1,0002.800% Notes due on August 22, 2024$2,0003.800% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2505.200% Notes due on December 3, 2025$1,0003.150% Notes due on August 22, 2027$3,5004.800% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2503.875% Notes due on August 22, 2037$2,7504.950% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,5004.050% Notes due on August 22, 2047$3,5004.250% Notes due on August 22, 2057$2,250Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2017, net sales from our International segment accounted for 30% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2017, of $11.1 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2017, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $280 million, $600 million, and $1.3 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2017, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $737 million. We record our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $415 million of our investments as of December 31, 2017. We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.34Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:43.988465
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2019,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.18Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” _______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.19Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $190 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.20Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$17,203 $18,365 $30,723Investing activities(9,516) (27,084) (12,369)Financing activities(3,716) 9,928 (7,686)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $26.0 billion, $31.0 billion, and $41.3 billion as of December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $9.1 billion, $11.1 billion, and $13.8 billion, as of December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.2 billion, $18.4 billion, and $30.7 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(9.5) billion, $(27.1) billion, and $(12.4) billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018, with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $6.7 billion, $10.1 billion, and $11.3 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three years. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $116 million, $14.0 billion, and $2.2 billion.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.7) billion, $9.9 billion, and $(7.7) billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other, which were $4.3 billion, $6.3 billion, and $8.5 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $5.7 billion, $9.6 billion, and $10.6 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $618 million, $16.2 billion, and $768 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018. During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. 21Table of ContentsIn April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018.We had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under our $620 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2018. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion, $769 million, and $1.2 billion. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $12.0 billion.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $412 million, $957 million, and $1.2 billion for 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.3 billion and $426 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.22Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market from the date of acquisition in August 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Net Sales: North America$79,785 $106,110 $141,366International43,983 54,297 65,866AWS12,219 17,459 25,655Consolidated$135,987 $177,866 $232,887Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America25% 33% 33%International24 23 21AWS55 43 47Consolidated27 31 31Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America25% 33% 33%International26 23 19AWS55 43 47Consolidated28 31 30Net sales mix: North America59% 60% 61%International32 30 28AWS9 10 11Consolidated100% 100% 100%Sales increased 31% in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(550) million, $210 million, and $1.3 billion for 2016, 2017, and 2018. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 33% in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.International sales increased 23% and 21% in 2017, and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(489) million, $138 million, and $1.3 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. AWS sales increased 43% and 47% in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.23Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Operating Income (Loss): North America$2,361 $2,837 $7,267International(1,283) (3,062) (2,142)AWS3,108 4,331 7,296Consolidated$4,186$4,106$12,421Operating income was $4.2 billion, $4.1 billion, and $12.4 billion for 2016, 2017, and 2018. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $27 million, $(4) million, and $17 million for 2016, 2017, and 2018. The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $89 million, $(85) million, and $258 million for 2016, 2017, and 2018. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(5) million, $(53) million, and $(49) million for 2016, 2017, and 2018.24Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Operating expenses: Cost of sales$88,265 $111,934 $139,156Fulfillment17,619 25,249 34,027Marketing7,233 10,069 13,814Technology and content16,085 22,620 28,837General and administrative2,432 3,674 4,336Other operating expense, net167 214 296Total operating expenses$131,801$173,760$220,466Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales23 % 27% 24%Fulfillment31 43 35Marketing38 39 37Technology and content28 41 27General and administrative39 51 18Other operating expense, net(2) 28 38Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales64.9 % 62.9% 59.8%Fulfillment13.0 14.2 14.6Marketing5.3 5.7 5.9Technology and content11.8 12.7 12.4General and administrative1.8 2.1 1.9Other operating expense, net0.1 0.1 0.1Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $16.2 billion, $21.7 billion, and $27.7 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.25Table of ContentsFulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores, and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.MarketingWe direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018, compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses.26Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense, NetOther operating expense, net was $167 million, $214 million, and $296 million during 2016, 2017, and 2018, and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $100 million, $202 million, and $440 million during 2016, 2017, and 2018. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $484 million, $848 million, and $1.4 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements.Our long-term debt was $24.7 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018. Our other long-term liabilities were $21.0 billion and $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt and Note 6 — Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $90 million, $346 million, and $(183) million during 2016, 2017, and 2018. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to foreign currency, equity warrant valuation, and equity securities gains.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 billion, $769 million, and $1.2 billion in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the 27Table of ContentsU.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of TaxEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(96) million, $(4) million, and $9 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The primary components of this activity during 2016, 2017, and 2018 were our equity-method investment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorded in 2016. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$17,203 $18,365 $30,723Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(6,737) (10,058) (11,323)Free cash flow$10,466$8,307$19,400 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(9,516) $(27,084) $(12,369)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,716) $9,928 $(7,686)28Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Lease Principal RepaymentsFree cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$17,203 $18,365 $30,723Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(6,737) (10,058) (11,323)Principal repayments of capital lease obligations(3,860) (4,799) (7,449)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(147) (200) (337)Free cash flow less lease principal repayments$6,459 $3,308 $11,614 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(9,516) $(27,084) $(12,369)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,716) $9,928 $(7,686)Free Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital LeasesFree cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$17,203 $18,365 $30,723Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives(6,737) (10,058) (11,323)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases(5,704) (9,637) (10,615)Principal repayments of finance lease obligations(147) (200) (337)Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases$4,615 $(1,530) $8,448 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(9,516) $(27,084) $(12,369)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(3,716) $9,928 $(7,686)All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.29Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior years.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 31, 2019, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2019 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with first quarter 2018. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in first quarter 2018. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.30Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2018 (in millions, except percentages): 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2018Money market funds $12,515 $— $— $— $— $— $12,515 $12,515Weighted average interest rate 1.16% —% —% —% —% —% 1.16% Corporate debt securities 3,220 1,086 560 120 16 — 5,002 4,990Weighted average interest rate 2.96% 3.25% 3.36% 3.86% 4.26% —% 3.09% U.S. government and agency securities 11,071 416 135 91 4 — 11,717 11,667Weighted average interest rate 2.35% 2.49% 2.68% 2.76% 3.38% —% 2.36% Asset-backed securities 305 255 162 121 52 — 895 892Weighted average interest rate 2.96% 3.07% 3.02% 2.99% 3.07% —% 3.01% Foreign government and agency securities 761 50 4 — — — 815 815Weighted average interest rate 2.60% 2.68% 3.32% —% —% —% 2.61% Other fixed income securities 89 67 32 — — — 188 188Weighted average interest rate 3.25% 2.89% 3.13% —% —% —% 3.10% $27,961 $1,874 $893 $332 $72 $— $31,132 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $31,06731Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2018, we had $25.0 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):2.600% Notes due on December 5, 2019$1,0001.900% Notes due on August 21, 2020$1,0003.300% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0002.500% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2502.400% Notes due on February 22, 2023$1,0002.800% Notes due on August 22, 2024$2,0003.800% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2505.200% Notes due on December 3, 2025$1,0003.150% Notes due on August 22, 2027$3,5004.800% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2503.875% Notes due on August 22, 2037$2,7504.950% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,5004.050% Notes due on August 22, 2047$3,5004.250% Notes due on August 22, 2057$2,250Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $25.0 billion as of December 31, 2018.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2018, net sales from our International segment accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2018, of $13.8 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $690 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2018, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 million, and $685 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.32Table of ContentsInvestment RiskAs of December 31, 2018, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $942 million. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $518 million of our investments as of December 31, 2018, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:39.869016
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2020,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.19Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million and 512 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.20Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $230 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.21Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$30,723 $38,514Investing activities(12,369) (24,281)Financing activities(7,686) (10,066)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $41.3 billion and $55.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $13.8 billion and $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $30.7 billion and $38.5 billion in 2018 and 2019. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(12.4) billion and $(24.3) billion in 2018 and 2019, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $11.3 billion, and $12.7 billion in 2018 and 2019, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS). We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion in 2018 and 2019.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(7.7) billion and $(10.1) billion in 2018 and 2019. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of long-term debt and other, and were $8.5 billion and $12.3 billion in 2018 and 2019. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $10.6 billion and $13.7 billion in 2018 and 2019, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time.We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) or unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $740 million of borrowings outstanding under our $740 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2019. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. In 2018 and 2019, we recorded net tax provisions of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign 22Table of Contentssubsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $13.4 billion.Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.2 billion and $881 million for 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” and “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $426 million and $321 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $15.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019Net Sales: North America$141,366 $170,773International65,866 74,723AWS25,655 35,026Consolidated$232,887 $280,522Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America33% 21%International21 13AWS47 37Consolidated31 20Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America33% 21%International19 17AWS47 37Consolidated30 22Net sales mix: North America61% 61%International28 27AWS11 12Consolidated100% 100%Sales increased 20% in 2019, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.6) billion for 2018 and 2019. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 21% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.International sales increased 13% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.4) billion in 2018 and 2019. AWS sales increased 37% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 24Table of ContentsOperating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019Operating Income (Loss): North America$7,267 $7,033International(2,142) (1,693)AWS7,296 9,201Consolidated$12,421$14,541Operating income was $12.4 billion and $14.5 billion for 2018 and 2019. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping costs and marketing expense, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $17 million and $23 million for 2018 and 2019. The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased marketing expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $258 million and $(116) million for 2018 and 2019. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(49) million and $273 million for 2018 and 2019.25Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019Operating expenses: Cost of sales$139,156 $165,536Fulfillment34,027 40,232Technology and content28,837 35,931Marketing13,814 18,878General and administrative4,336 5,203Other operating expense (income), net296 201Total operating expenses$220,466$265,981Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales24% 19 %Fulfillment35 18Technology and content27 25Marketing37 37General and administrative18 20Other operating expense (income), net38 (32)Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales59.8% 59.0 %Fulfillment14.6 14.3Technology and content12.4 12.8Marketing5.9 6.7General and administrative1.9 1.9Other operating expense (income), net0.1 0.1Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $27.7 billion and $37.9 billion in 2018 and 2019. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.26Table of ContentsFulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers, which will impact each of our segments. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers.MarketingMarketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.27Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $296 million and $201 million during 2018 and 2019, and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $440 million and $832 million during 2018 and 2019. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2019. The increase is primarily related to finance leases.Our long-term lease liabilities were $9.7 billion and $39.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. Our long-term debt was $23.5 billion and $23.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(183) million and $203 million during 2018 and 2019. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 and 2019. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. We adopted new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 without retrospectively adjusting prior periods. As a result, the line items used in our calculation of measures of free cash flows have changed. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”28Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$30,723 $38,514Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(11,323) (12,689)Free cash flow$19,400$25,825 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(12,369) $(24,281)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(7,686) $(10,066)Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing ObligationsFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations.

In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased.

Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted.All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.30Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 30, 2020, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2020 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with first quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.31Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2019 (in millions, except percentages): 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2019Money market funds $18,850 $— $— $— $— $— $18,850 $18,850Weighted average interest rate 1.09% —% —% —% —% —% 1.09% Corporate debt securities 7,629 2,988 1,052 152 8 — 11,829 11,881Weighted average interest rate 2.29% 2.63% 2.57% 2.38% 2.90% —% 2.41% U.S. government and agency securities 4,893 1,634 486 43 16 — 7,072 7,080Weighted average interest rate 1.64% 2.09% 2.01% 2.29% 2.03% —% 1.77% Asset-backed securities 1,492 546 180 95 38 — 2,351 2,360Weighted average interest rate 2.57% 2.52% 2.53% 2.29% 2.52% —% 2.54% Foreign government and agency securities 4,630 168 4 — 2 — 4,804 4,794Weighted average interest rate 1.90% 2.57% 2.08% —% 2.30% —% 1.92% Other fixed income securities 93 94 129 75 — — 391 394Weighted average interest rate 2.39% 2.32% 2.10% 1.92% —% —% 2.19% $37,587 $5,430 $1,851 $365 $64 $— $45,297 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $45,35932Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2019, we had $24.8 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):1.900% Notes due on August 21, 2020$1,0003.300% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0002.500% Notes due on November 29, 2022$1,2502.400% Notes due on February 22, 2023$1,0002.800% Notes due on August 22, 2024$2,0003.800% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2505.200% Notes due on December 3, 2025$1,0003.150% Notes due on August 22, 2027$3,5004.800% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2503.875% Notes due on August 22, 2037$2,7504.950% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,5004.050% Notes due on August 22, 2047$3,5004.250% Notes due on August 22, 2057$2,250Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $27.8 billion as of December 31, 2019.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2019, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2019, of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $765 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2019, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $195 million, $385 million, and $775 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2019, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $3.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $679 million of our investments as of December 31, 2019, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:40.647520
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2021,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle1. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.19Table of Contentsby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 512 million and 518 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Effects of COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, and third-party sellers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made numerous process updates across our operations worldwide, and adapted our fulfillment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing, personal protective gear, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. Since February 2020, we have hired over 400,000 full-time and part-time employees to increase our fulfillment network capacity. We incurred approximately $4.0 billion in COVID-19 related costs in Q4 2020, for a total of more than $11.5 billion during 2020. We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.20Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $270 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.21Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20192020Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$38,514 $66,064 Investing activities(24,281)(59,611)Financing activities(10,066)(1,104)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $55.0 billion and $84.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $15.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $38.5 billion and $66.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(24.3) billion and $(59.6) billion in 2019 and 2020, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $12.7 billion, and $35.0 billion in 2019 and 2020, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion in 2019 and 2020.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(10.1) billion and $(1.1) billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds of short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $2.3 billion and $17.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $12.3 billion and $18.4 billion in 2019 and 2020. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $13.7 billion and $11.6 billion in 2019 and 2020, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $17.2 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income, and all remaining federal tax credits, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $881 million and $1.7 billion for 2019 and 2020. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the 22Table of ContentsEuropean Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $321 million and $257 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $26.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have caused significant market volatility. These disruptions can contribute to defaults in our accounts receivable, affect asset valuations resulting in impairment charges, and affect the availability of lease and financing credit as well as other segments of the credit markets. We have utilized a range of financing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect to continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market conditions. However, due to the rapidly evolving global situation, it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Effects of COVID-19As reflected in the discussion below, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had varying effects on our 2020 results of operations. Higher net sales in the North America and International segments reflect increased demand, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Other effects in the North America and International segments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces.We expect the effects of fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints, elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue into all or portions of Q1 2021. However, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, the actions taken in response to the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, or other impacts of the pandemic, and whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations.24Table of ContentsNet SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20192020Net Sales:North America$170,773 $236,282 International74,723 104,412 AWS35,026 45,370 Consolidated$280,522 $386,064 Year-over-year Percentage Growth:North America21 %38 %International13 40 AWS37 30 Consolidated20 38 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:North America21 %38 %International17 38 AWS37 30 Consolidated22 37 Net sales mix:North America61 %61 %International27 27 AWS12 12 Consolidated100 %100 %Sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(2.6) billion and $1.4 billion for 2019 and 2020. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints.International sales increased 40% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(2.4) billion and $1.7 billion in 2019 and 2020.AWS sales increased 30% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 25Table of ContentsOperating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,20192020Operating Income (Loss):North America$7,033 $8,651 International(1,693)717 AWS9,201 13,531 Consolidated$14,541 $22,899 Operating income was $14.5 billion and $22.9 billion for 2019 and 2020. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect North America operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $23 million and $8 million for 2019 and 2020.The International operating income in 2020, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect International operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(116) million and $411 million for 2019 and 2020. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $273 million and $30 million for 2019 and 2020.26Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20192020Operating expenses:Cost of sales$165,536 $233,307 Fulfillment40,232 58,517 Technology and content35,931 42,740 Marketing18,878 22,008 General and administrative5,203 6,668 Other operating expense (income), net201 (75)Total operating expenses$265,981 $363,165 Year-over-year Percentage Growth:Cost of sales19 %41 %Fulfillment18 45 Technology and content25 19 Marketing37 17 General and administrative20 28 Other operating expense (income), net(32)(137)Percent of Net Sales:Cost of sales59.0 %60.4 %Fulfillment14.3 15.2 Technology and content12.8 11.1 Marketing6.7 5.7 General and administrative1.9 1.7 Other operating expense (income), net0.1 — Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9 billion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.27Table of ContentsFulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers.MarketingMarketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19.While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.28Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $201 million and $(75) million during 2019 and 2020, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $832 million and $555 million during 2019 and 2020. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.Our long-term lease liabilities were $39.8 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our long-term debt was $23.4 billion and $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity warrant valuations, equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign currency.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.29Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20192020Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$38,514 $66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(12,689)(35,044)Free cash flow$25,825 $31,020 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(24,281)$(59,611)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(10,066)$(1,104)Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing ObligationsFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations.

In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20192020Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$38,514 $66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(12,689)(35,044)Free cash flow25,825 31,020 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1)(12,916)(9,104)Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2)(392)(427)Principal repayments of financing obligations(27)(53)Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations$12,490 $21,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(24,281)$(59,611)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(10,066)$(1,104)___________________(1)For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588 million. (2)For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,628 million and $10,642 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.31Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations.First Quarter 2021 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.32Table of Contents Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages): 20212022202320242025ThereafterTotalEstimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2020Money market funds$27,430 $— $— $— $— $— $27,430 $27,430 Weighted average interest rate(0.16)%— %— %— %— %— %(0.16)%Corporate debt securities16,505 4,459 5,531 1,990 886 — 29,371 29,988 Weighted average interest rate0.42 %1.65 %1.32 %1.86 %1.84 % 0.92 %U.S. government and agency securities5,439 587 899 298 67 71 7,361 7,439 Weighted average interest rate0.30 %1.38 %1.12 %1.74 %1.13 %2.97 %0.58 %Asset-backed securities870 773 472 763 243 46 3,167 3,235 Weighted average interest rate2.08 %2.00 %1.53 %2.13 %1.57 %1.25 %1.94 %Foreign government and agency securities4,932 147 45 3 — — 5,127 5,131 Weighted average interest rate0.25 %0.74 %1.28 %1.76 %— %— %0.28 %Other fixed income securities109 156 230 160 43 — 698 710 Weighted average interest rate2.10 %1.85 %1.10 %0.84 %1.31 %— %1.38 %$55,285 $6,122 $7,177 $3,214 $1,239 $117 $73,154 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities$73,933 As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term debt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2020, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.7 billion in comparison with the prior year.33Table of ContentsWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2020, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $4.7 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2020, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $485 million, and $970 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2020, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $6.9 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $3.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2020, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We assess our equity investments in private companies for impairment. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.34Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:23.364598
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2022,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle1. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.18Table of Contentsby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 518 million and 523 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Critical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.19Table of ContentsInventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$66,064 $46,327 Investing activities(59,611)(58,154)Financing activities(1,104)6,291 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $84.4 billion and $96.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2021, compared to the prior year, was 20Table of Contentsprimarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.21Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” OverviewAs reflected in the discussion below, ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects on our 2021 results of operations, although some effects, including customer demand, are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify. Moreover, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, supply chain disruptions, and labor availability and costs, or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic, and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. However, we expect our net sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. In addition, these direct and indirect factors can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by the pandemic, including increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets and global supply chain constraints. We expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into Q1 2022.22Table of ContentsNet SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Net Sales:North America$236,282 $279,833 International104,412 127,787 AWS45,370 62,202 Consolidated$386,064 $469,822 Year-over-year Percentage Growth:North America38 %18 %International40 22 AWS30 37 Consolidated38 22 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:North America38 %18 %International38 20 AWS30 37 Consolidated37 21 Net sales mix:North America61 %60 %International27 27 AWS12 13 Consolidated100 %100 %Sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.4 billion and $3.8 billion for 2020 and 2021. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our North America sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021.International sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our International sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.AWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.23Table of ContentsOperating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,20202021Operating Income (Loss):North America$8,651 $7,271 International717 (924)AWS13,531 18,532 Consolidated$22,899 $24,879 Operating income was $22.9 billion and $24.9 billion for 2020 and 2021. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $8 million and $88 million for 2020 and 2021.The International operating loss in 2021, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, and increased carrier rates, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $411 million and $435 million for 2020 and 2021. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $30 million and $(372) million for 2020 and 2021.24Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Operating expenses:Cost of sales$233,307 $272,344 Fulfillment58,517 75,111 Technology and content42,740 56,052 Marketing22,008 32,551 General and administrative6,668 8,823 Other operating expense (income), net(75)62 Total operating expenses$363,165 $444,943 Year-over-year Percentage Growth:Cost of sales41 %17 %Fulfillment45 28 Technology and content19 31 Marketing17 48 General and administrative28 32 Other operating expense (income), net(137)(183)Percent of Net Sales:Cost of sales60.4 %58.0 %Fulfillment15.2 16.0 Technology and content11.1 11.9 Marketing5.7 6.9 General and administrative1.7 1.9 Other operating expense (income), net— — Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, as well as increased carrier rates, increased wage rates and incentives, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1 billion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.FulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and 25Table of Contentscontent.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, which will primarily impact our AWS segment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment.MarketingMarketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to higher marketing spend, which was constrained in 2020 in response to COVID-19, and increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees.26Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $(75) million and $62 million during 2020 and 2021, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020, offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $555 million and $448 million during 2020 and 2021. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.Our long-term lease liabilities were $52.6 billion and $67.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our long-term debt was $31.8 billion and $48.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $2.4 billion and $14.6 billion during 2020 and 2021. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a valuation gain of $11.8 billion from our equity securities of Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November 2021.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.9 billion and $4.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.27Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$66,064 $46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(35,044)(55,396)Free cash flow$31,020 $(9,069)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(59,611)$(58,154)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(1,104)$6,291 Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing ObligationsFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$66,064 $46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(35,044)(55,396)Free cash flow31,020 (9,069)Principal repayments of finance leases(10,642)(11,163)Principal repayments of financing obligations(53)(162)Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations$20,325 $(20,394)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(59,611)$(58,154)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(1,104)$6,291 28Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20202021Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$66,064 $46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(35,044)(55,396)Free cash flow31,020 (9,069)Equipment acquired under finance leases (1)(9,104)(4,422)Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2)(427)(687)Principal repayments of financing obligations(53)(162)Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations$21,436 $(14,340)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(59,611)$(58,154)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(1,104)$6,291 ___________________(1)For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $11,588 million and $7,061 million. (2)For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $10,642 million and $11,163 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Effect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020Year Ended December 31, 2021 AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)Net sales$386,064 $(1,438)$384,626 $469,822 $(3,804)$466,018 Operating expenses363,165 (989)362,176 444,943 (3,653)441,290 Operating income22,899 (449)22,450 24,879 (151)24,728 ___________________(1)Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.(2)Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.29Table of ContentsGuidanceWe provided guidance on February 3, 2022, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. First Quarter 2022 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.30Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages):20222023202420252026ThereafterTotalEstimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2021Money market funds$20,312 $— $— $— $— $— $20,312 $20,312 Weighted average interest rate(0.02)%— %— %— %— %— %(0.02)%Corporate debt securities18,063 6,253 8,231 2,044 921 — 35,512 35,764 Weighted average interest rate0.34 %1.02 %1.02 %1.35 %1.22 %— %0.70 %U.S. government and agency securities1,584 837 561 672 558 61 4,273 4,300 Weighted average interest rate0.30 %0.39 %1.00 %1.14 %0.99 %1.01 %0.65 %Asset-backed securities1,237 1,966 1,722 959 312 500 6,696 6,738 Weighted average interest rate1.19 %0.93 %1.28 %1.27 %0.99 %1.14 %1.14 %Foreign government and agency securities105 52 22 — — — 179 181 Weighted average interest rate0.97 %1.12 %0.74 %— %— %— %0.98 %Other fixed income securities142 264 222 57 — — 685 686 Weighted average interest rate0.65 %0.93 %0.68 %1.35 %— %— %0.83 %$41,443 $9,372 $10,758 $3,732 $1,791 $561 $67,657 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities$67,981 As of December 31, 2021, we had long-term debt with a face value of $50.6 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.31Table of ContentsForeign Exchange RiskDuring 2021, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2021, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” for additional information.32Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:20.350019
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2023,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsForward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix 19Table of Contentsof suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.5 billion and 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product 20Table of Contentsvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $390 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20212022Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$46,327 $46,752 Investing activities(58,154)(37,601)Financing activities6,291 9,718 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $96.0 billion and $70.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $22.7 billion and $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.3 billion and $46.8 billion in 2021 and 2022. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2022, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, partially offset by changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.21Table of ContentsCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(58.2) billion and $(37.6) billion in 2021 and 2022, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $55.4 billion, and $58.3 billion in 2021 and 2022, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect to continue these investments over time, with increased spending on technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2022. We funded the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand. We expect to fund the acquisitions of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) and iRobot Corporation with cash on hand.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $6.3 billion and $9.7 billion in 2021 and 2022. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $27.0 billion and $62.7 billion in 2021 and 2022. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $20.7 billion and $53.0 billion in 2021 and 2022. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $7.1 billion and $675 million in 2021 and 2022.We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities, $6.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.7 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included a partial election for 2020 and 2021, and a full election for 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $3.7 billion and $6.0 billion for 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $260 million and $365 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. 22Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” OverviewMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market volatility, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. These factors contributed to increases in our operating costs during 2022, particularly across our North America and International segments, primarily due to a return to more normal, seasonal demand volumes in relation to our fulfillment network fixed costs, increased transportation and utility costs, and increased wage rates. In addition, rising fuel, utility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2023.Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20212022Net Sales:North America$279,833 $315,880 International127,787 118,007 AWS62,202 80,096 Consolidated$469,822 $513,983 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):North America18 %13 %International22 (8)AWS37 29 Consolidated22 9 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:North America18 %13 %International20 4 AWS37 29 Consolidated21 13 Net sales mix:North America60 %61 %International27 23 AWS13 16 Consolidated100 %100 %Sales increased 9% in 2022, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced net sales by $15.5 billion in 2022. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 13% in 2022, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers.23Table of ContentsInternational sales decreased 8% in 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced International net sales by $15.0 billion in 2022.AWS sales increased 29% in 2022, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,20212022Operating Income (Loss)North America$7,271 $(2,847)International(924)(7,746)AWS18,532 22,841 Consolidated$24,879 $12,248 Operating income was $24.9 billion and $12.2 billion for 2021 and 2022. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The North America operating loss in 2022, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased fulfillment and shipping costs, due in part to increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives, increased technology and content costs, and growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $274 million in 2022.The increase in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased fulfillment and shipping costs, due in part to increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives, increased technology and content costs, and growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased advertising sales and increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating loss by $857 million in 2022. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $1.4 billion in 2022.24Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20212022Operating expenses:Cost of sales$272,344 $288,831 Fulfillment75,111 84,299 Technology and content56,052 73,213 Sales and marketing32,551 42,238 General and administrative8,823 11,891 Other operating expense (income), net62 1,263 Total operating expenses$444,943 $501,735 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):Cost of sales17 %6 %Fulfillment28 12 Technology and content31 31 Sales and marketing48 30 General and administrative32 35 Other operating expense (income), net(183)1,936 Percent of Net Sales:Cost of sales58.0 %56.2 %Fulfillment16.0 16.4 Technology and content11.9 14.2 Sales and marketing6.9 8.2 General and administrative1.9 2.3 Other operating expense (income), net0.0 0.2 Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and product costs resulting from increased sales and increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $10.8 billion in 2022.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $76.7 billion and $83.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.FulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related 25Table of Contentstransaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased investments in our fulfillment network and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and increased wage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $2.5 billion in 2022.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and higher marketing spend.While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.General and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees.26Table of ContentsOther Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $62 million and $1.3 billion during 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2022, $1.1 billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $448 million and $989 million during 2021 and 2022, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2021 and 2022 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Our long-term lease liabilities were $67.7 billion and $73.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our long-term debt was $48.7 billion and $67.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $14.6 billion and $(16.8) billion during 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 and 2022 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $11.8 billion and $(12.7) billion from our equity investment in Rivian.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. We recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $4.8 billion and $(3.2) billion in 2021 and 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.27Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20212022Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$46,327 $46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(55,396)(58,321)Free cash flow$(9,069)$(11,569)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(58,154)$(37,601)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$6,291 $9,718 Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing ObligationsFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations.

In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 20212022Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$46,327 $46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(55,396)(58,321)Free cash flow(9,069)(11,569)Equipment acquired under finance leases (1)(4,422)(299)Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2)(687)(670)Principal repayments of financing obligations(162)(248)Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations$(14,340)$(12,786)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(58,154)$(37,601)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$6,291 $9,718 ___________________(1)For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $7,061 million and $675 million. (2)For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $11,163 million and $7,941 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.Effect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021Year Ended December 31, 2022 AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)Net sales$469,822 $(3,804)$466,018 $513,983 $15,495 $529,478 Operating expenses444,943 (3,653)441,290 501,735 16,356 518,091 Operating income24,879 (151)24,728 12,248 (861)11,387 ___________________(1)Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.(2)Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.29Table of ContentsGuidanceWe provided guidance on February 2, 2023, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2023 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.30Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2022 (in millions, except percentages):20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalEstimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2022Money market funds$27,899 $— $— $— $— $— $27,899 $27,899 Weighted average interest rate4.18 %— %— %— %— %— %4.18 %Corporate debt securities17,500 2,486 2,332 748 9 — 23,075 22,627 Weighted average interest rate4.06 %0.97 %1.23 %1.45 %2.33 %— %3.35 %U.S. government and agency securities819 358 554 396 80 75 2,282 2,146 Weighted average interest rate1.05 %0.98 %0.81 %0.83 %1.24 %1.83 %0.98 %Asset-backed securities1,059 872 413 146 128 72 2,690 2,572 Weighted average interest rate0.99 %1.30 %1.37 %1.39 %1.41 %1.06 %1.19 %Foreign government and agency securities519 19 — — — — 538 535 Weighted average interest rate4.24 %0.60 %— %— %— %— %4.11 %Other fixed income securities138 61 48 — — — 247 237 Weighted average interest rate0.40 %0.56 %1.15 %— %— %— %0.58 %$47,934 $3,796 $3,347 $1,290 $217 $147 $56,731 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities$56,016 As of December 31, 2022, we had long-term debt with a face value of $70.5 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.31Table of ContentsForeign Exchange RiskDuring 2022, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $15.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2022, of $18.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $915 million, $1.8 billion, and $3.7 billion. We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2022, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $275 million, $555 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment RiskAs of December 31, 2022, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $7.2 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian, represent $5.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” for additional information.32Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:24.628880
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section should be read in conjunction with “Forward-Looking Statements” below, as well as Item 1 of Part 1, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors and manufacturers and products sold by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize revenue as the seller of record from items we offer from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items offered by third parties. 21 Table of Contents Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. We also seek to minimize shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing consolidated segment operating profit and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in consolidated segment operating profit result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping costs low. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. Our price reductions take several forms: we reduce the sales prices of products we sell, we recruit third-party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages, and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement; however, we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Total shares outstanding plus employee stock awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2003 compared to 2002. We leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable cost per unit. Our customer experience costs, specifically the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers, are largely fixed costs. The customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs, credit-card processing fees, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and certain aspects of our marketing costs. We focus on maintaining a lean culture by reducing defects in our processes, and obtaining volume discounts from suppliers to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers. Because we are able to turn our inventory quickly, we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 18, 19, and 16 for 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 50, 52, and 49 at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broad-band service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase the ubiquity of computers in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of cost of sales to average inventory. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 22 Table of Contents Finally, we want to emphasize that we do not believe that our reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 should be viewed as a material positive event or should be considered predictive of future results. As we discuss in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currencies,” had it not been for our decision to settle intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, we would have reported a small net loss for 2003. Also, as our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, our total revenue, profit, and free cash flow has significantly benefited each of the past two years from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our faster-growing international websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our fast growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to evaluate our growth rates after the effect of currency changes. For example, although we grew 34% during 2003, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 28%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local-currency growth rates. For a description of, and additional information about, each line item summarized below, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the rate of growth of the economy in general and of the Internet and online commerce, customer spending patterns, world events, the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, risks of inventory management, the degree to which we enter into commercial agreements and strategic transactions and maintain and develop commercial relationships, foreign exchange risks, seasonality, international growth and expansion, and risks of fulfillment, throughput, and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results,” which, along with the following discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations. Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 23 Table of Contents Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred to the carrier or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; (2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and (3) delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria outlined in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from third-party sellers and amounts earned through our Merchant.com program are recognized when the item is sold by the third-party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. We also record an allowance, using historical experience, for losses we incur on our payment guarantee from disputes by customers against third-party sellers. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered 24 Table of Contents long-term investments, where settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were historically recorded to equity as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurement of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income. The effect for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2003 was to increase net income by $36 million. The effect of this treatment was very significant to our net income for the year and for the quarter. Had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of these intercompany balances, we would have had a net loss for 2003 and our net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 would have been reduced by almost 50%. See Item 8 of Part II “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12—Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other” for further discussion. Restructuring Estimates Restructuring-related liabilities include estimates for, among other things, anticipated disposition of lease obligations. Key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals, estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs, and estimates for brokerage and other related costs. Additionally, we may determine that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, may be necessary for our future expansion needs. We periodically evaluate and, if necessary, adjust our estimates based on currently-available information. If we elect to utilize this office space, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we will adjust our restructuring-related liability and classify future payments to “General and administrative” on the consolidated statements of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities which were $1.40 billion, $1.30 billion, and $997 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Additionally, we received cash from exercises of employee stock awards of $163 million, $122 million, and $15 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect that stock award exercises will decline as a source of cash as a result of our decision to use restricted stock unit awards as our primary form of stock-based compensation. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we held $764 million and $398 million in foreign currencies, primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. During 2003, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were utilized to redeem our 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (“10% Senior Discount Notes”) and a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (“4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes”). Total redemption payments, including redemption premiums, totaled $483 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other.” Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and third-party sellers, offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services, employee compensation, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers and third-party sellers generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels. We generally experience a net cash outflow during the first quarter of each year, as we pay suppliers for inventory that was purchased and sold in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2003, we held $294 million of products in inventories, an increase of $91 million in comparison to the prior year. The increase in inventories corresponds with our efforts to add product categories, increase selection and availability in both existing and new product categories, take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers, and the effect of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, our 25 Table of Contents accounts payable at December 31, 2003 increased $202 million over the prior year end corresponding with increased sales volume. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. In 2003, the U.S. Dollar weakened considerably relative to the Euro resulting in higher U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments. Additionally, in 2003 we began accruing interest on our 10% Senior Discount Notes and paid $2 million of interest when we repaid the full principal amount. We also made interest payments of $3 million associated with the $200 million partial redemption of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes; this payment was otherwise scheduled to be paid in 2004. We currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest payments relating to the 6.875% PEACS, and, as a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other.” Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with our buying and selling of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software costs. Cash provided by investing activities was $237 million during 2003, while cash used in investing activities was $122 million and $253 million during 2002 and 2001. Our capital expenditures were $46 million, $39 million, and $50 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of cash proceeds from exercises of stock options, repayment of long-term debt, and repayment of capital lease obligations. Cash used in financing activities was $332 million during 2003 resulting primarily from repayments of long-term debt obligations. Cash provided by financing activities was $107 million during 2002 and 2001. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of employee stock options to decline over time as we plan to continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for employee stock-based awards. In January 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. In addition to this debt repurchase program, on February 26, 2004, we will redeem $150 million of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Restructuring-related commitments: Operating leases, net of estimated sublease income $ 9,577 $ 4,998 $ 3,421 $ 3,356 $ 2,691 $ 5,300 $ 29,343 Other 897 300 — — — — 1,197 Restructuring-related commitments 10,474 5,298 3,421 3,356 2,691 5,300 30,540 Other commitments: Debt principal and other (1)(2) 3,013 74 — — 246 1,931,160 1,934,493 Debt interest (1)(2) 109,656 109,656 109,656 109,656 109,656 144,517 692,797 Capital leases 1,678 868 341 — — — 2,887 Operating leases (3) 51,498 43,323 42,391 39,100 38,181 131,040 345,533 Purchase obligations (4) 187,881 — — — — — 187,881 Other commitments 353,726 153,921 152,388 148,756 148,083 2,206,717 3,163,591 Total commitments $ 364,200 $ 159,219 $ 155,809 $ 152,112 $ 150,774 $ 2,212,017 $ 3,194,131 (1) The principal payment due in 2010 and the annual interest payments due under our 6.875% PEACS fluctuate based on the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.260. Due to 26 Table of Contents fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our principal debt obligation under this instrument since issuance has increased by $197 million through December 31, 2003. We cannot predict the performance of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. (2) See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17—Subsequent Events.” (3) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2003, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate of $346 million. If we had applied to our equipment-related operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $76 million of additional assets and obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2003. (4) Consists of legally-binding commitments to purchase inventory. Legally-binding commitments associated with non-inventory purchases are not significant. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position (and our Board of Directors has authorized the debt repurchase program discussed above). The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. We do not currently have a line-of-credit, and there can be no assurance that lines-of-credit or other financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations Segment Operating Income (Loss) Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (amounts in thousands) Segment Operating Income: North America $ 283,045 $ 179,667 $ 57,501 International 78,193 435 (102,503 ) Consolidated $ 361,238 $ 180,102 $ (45,002 ) Year-over-year improvement: North America 58 % 212 % International 17,875 N/A Consolidated 101 N/A Segment Operating Margin: North America 9 % 7 % 2 % International 4 0 (15 ) Consolidated 7 5 (1 ) The key drivers in the year-over-year improvement in segment operating income are revenue growth and efficiencies in our fulfillment process. Revenue growth was driven, in part, by lowering prices, including increased adoption by our customers of our free shipping offers. Operating expenses in our North America and International segments increased $22 million and $61 million, or 4% and 24% in 2003 in comparison to the prior year. The increases in segment operating expenses were primarily related to variable costs, including fulfillment-related costs for picking, packaging, and shipping our products to customers, and credit card fees, offset by reductions in most other expense categories. Segment operating expenses represented 18% and 16% of net sales for North America and International segments, compared with 20% and 21% in the prior year. The year-over-year 27 Table of Contents declines in segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales result from leveraging the fixed cost portion of our operations over increased volume. See “Net Sales and Gross Profit” below for additional information about increases in our sales volume. In 2002, improvements in our income (loss) from operations over the prior year were also significantly affected by the decline in amortization charges, primarily relating to the required adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and lower restructuring-related charges. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net Sales North America Media $ 2,269,472 $ 1,994,949 $ 1,810,175 Electronics and other general merchandise 878,519 681,041 577,524 Other 110,422 85,467 72,637 Total North America 3,258,413 2,761,457 2,460,336 International Media 1,779,476 1,103,665 645,453 Electronics and other general merchandise 224,606 65,877 16,134 Other 1,204 1,937 510 Total International 2,005,286 1,171,479 662,097 Consolidated Media 4,048,948 3,098,614 2,455,628 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,103,125 746,918 593,658 Other 111,626 87,404 73,147 Total consolidated $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 $ 3,122,433 Net Sales Growth Rate North America Media 14 % 10 % Electronics and other general merchandise 29 18 Other 29 18 Total North America 18 12 International Media 61 71 Electronics and other general merchandise 241 308 Other (38 ) 280 Total International 71 77 Consolidated Media 31 26 Electronics and other general merchandise 48 26 Other 28 19 Total Consolidated 34 26 Consolidated Revenue Mix Media 77 % 79 % 79 % Electronics and other general merchandise 21 19 19 Other 2 2 2 Total Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue growth is due to increased demand, which was driven by increased selection, lower prices, including from our free shipping offers, and improved features and services available on our websites, including 28 Table of Contents our Amazon Marketplace and Merchant@ programs. Revenues improved $232 million and $47 million in 2003 and 2002 in comparison to the preceding years due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the U.S. Dollar weakened. The future growth of our International segment, measured in U.S. Dollars, may fluctuate significantly with changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results—We Have Foreign Exchange Risk.” We also anticipate that, as the revenue base of our International segment increases, the percentage growth rates in local currency will likely decline over time. Sales of products by third-party sellers on our websites continue to increase. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they result in lower revenues but higher gross margins per unit, as there are no associated costs classified within cost of sales, unless we perform fulfillment services. To the extent product sales by third-party sellers continue to increase, we anticipate improvement in gross margin, offset to the extent we offer additional or broader price reductions, free shipping offers, and other promotions. Gross profit is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Gross Profit North America $ 866,664 $ 740,985 $ 657,229 International 390,504 251,633 141,329 Consolidated $ 1,257,168 $ 992,618 $ 798,558 Gross Profit Growth Rate North America 17 % 13 % International 55 78 Consolidated 27 24 Gross Margin North America 27 % 27 % 27 % International 19 21 21 Consolidated 24 25 26 The increases in gross profit in comparison with the prior years corresponds with increased revenue, offset by our year-round free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our mix of sales during the year, sales volumes by third-party sellers, competitive pricing decisions, changes in vendor pricing, and general efforts to reduce prices for our customers over time, as well as the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers. These free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue as a percentage of sales and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. In particular, we commenced offering free super saver delivery in the U.K. in 2003, and this decision decreased the gross margins for our International segment. We view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them. Gross profit in 2003 benefited $46 million in comparison to 2002 due to changes in foreign exchange rates as the U.S. Dollar weakened. Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Supplemental Information Shipping Activity Shipping revenue $ 372,000 $ 364,749 $ 357,325 Net shipping cost (136,468 ) (39,554 ) (19,163 ) We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping alternatives that result in a net cost to us in delivering products. We seek to 29 Table of Contents offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes and better operating efficiencies and by negotiating better terms with our suppliers. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs were $477 million, $392 million, and $374 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 9%, 10%, and 12% of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in comparison with the prior year primarily relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and our mix of product sales. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of our products. The improvement in fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales results from improvements in productivity and accuracy, the increase in units fulfilled, which leverages the fixed-cost portion of our fulfillment network, efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties, a decline in customer service contacts per order resulting from improvements in our operations, and enhancements to our customer self-service features available on our websites. These improvements were offset, in part, by credit card fees associated with third-party seller transactions, which represent a significant percentage relative to commission amounts earned, and as a result negatively affect fulfillment as a percentage of net sales. Marketing Marketing expenses, net of co-operative marketing reimbursements, were $123 million, $125 million, and $138 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 2%, 3%, and 4% of net sales. Although we do not expect them to do so, if co-operative marketing reimbursements decline in future periods, we may incur additional expenses to continue certain promotions or elect to reduce or discontinue them. We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of online marketing channels, including our Syndicated Stores and Associates programs, which enable associated websites to make our products available to their audiences with fulfillment performed by us. Under these arrangements, we pay a sales commission on product sales, which is classified as “Marketing” on our consolidated statements of operations. Declines in expense for marketing-related activities reflect management efforts to cut ineffective marketing programs, as well as reduced rates charged to us for some online marketing activities. These decreases are partially offset by increased investment in marketing channels considered most effective in driving incremental net sales, such as targeted online advertising through various Web portals and our Associates program. We expect absolute dollars spent in marketing to increase in 2004. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses were $208 million, $216 million, and $241 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 4%, 5%, and 8% of net sales. The decline in absolute dollars spent for 2003 primarily reflects improved expense management and general price reductions in most expense categories, offset by increases in employee-related costs. The decline in absolute dollars spent for 2002 primarily reflects our migration to a technology platform that utilizes a less-costly technology infrastructure. We expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase during 2004 as we continue to hire more computer scientists and software engineers, however as a percentage of net sales, we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were $88 million, $79 million, and $90 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001, representing 2% of net sales for 2003 and 2002, and 3% of net sales for 2001. We generally expect administrative costs to increase over time commensurate with the increasing size and complexity of our business. In 2004, we expect ongoing general and administrative costs to increase in absolute terms, however as a percentage of net sales, we expect these costs to remain flat or possibly decline. 30 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $88 million, $69 million, and $5 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. In late 2002, we began issuing restricted stock units as our primary form of stock-based compensation. Previously, we primarily issued at-the-money stock options. In certain of our foreign jurisdictions, we continue to grant stock options. At December 31, 2003, we had 30 million stock awards outstanding, including 25 million stock options, which had a weighted average exercise price of $12.46; 4 million restricted stock units; and 1 million shares of restricted stock. Common shares outstanding, which includes restricted stock, plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units, totaled 433 million at December 31, 2003, flat with the prior year. For additional information about our stock-based compensation and awards, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” and “—Note 8—Stockholders’ Deficit.” Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $3 million, $5 million, and $181 million for 2003, 2002, and 2001. Goodwill is no longer amortized, in accordance with GAAP, and based on the current balance of intangibles, absent any additional investment, amortization of intangibles will not be significant going forward. Restructuring-Related and Other Cash payments resulting from our January 2001 operational restructuring were $26 million and $45 million for 2003 and 2002. Based on currently available information, we estimate the remaining restructuring-related cash outflows will be as follows (in thousands): Leases Other Total Years Ending December 31, 2004 $ 9,577 $ 897 $ 10,474 2005 4,998 300 5,298 2006 3,421 — 3,421 2007 3,356 — 3,356 2008 2,691 — 2,691 Thereafter 5,300 — 5,300 Total estimated cash outflows (1) $ 29,343 $ 1,197 $ 30,540 (1) Cash flows are presented net of an estimated $39 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2003 we have signed sublease agreements totaling $15 million. For additional information about our January 2001 operational restructuring, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Restructuring-Related and Other.” Net Interest Expense We generally invest our excess cash in A-rated or higher short-to-intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them. The primary components of our interest expense relate to our debt instruments. During 2003, we redeemed our 10% Senior Discount Notes and we redeemed a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. At December 31, 2003, our total long-term indebtedness was $1.95 billion. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other” and “—Note 17—Subsequent Events.” 31 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was a gain of $3 million and $6 million for 2003 and 2002, and a loss of $2 million in 2001. These amounts consist of gains on sales of marketable securities; state, foreign, and other taxes; and miscellaneous non-operating gains and losses. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11—Other Income (Expense), Net” for additional information. Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other consisted of the following (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Foreign-currency gain (loss) on 6.875% PEACS (1) $ (140,130 ) $ (103,136 ) $ 46,613 Loss on redemption of long-term debt (2) (23,829 ) — — Foreign currency effect on intercompany balances (3) 35,574 — — Other-than-temporary impairments and other (4) (1,276 ) 6,863 (48,754 ) Total remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other $ (129,661 ) $ (96,273 ) $ (2,141 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other” for additional information on repayments of long-term debt in 2003. (3) Represents the gain associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates (See Item 8 of Part II “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currencies”). In future periods, remeasurement of intercompany balances that remain outstanding will result in gains or losses being recorded to “Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. (4) Includes a $6 million loss relating to the termination of our Euro Currency Swap in 2003. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other” for additional information on the termination of our Euro Currency Swap. As a result of this termination, any fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange will have a greater effect on our interest expense. Income Taxes Subject to certain limitations, we have approximately $2.9 billion of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire at various times starting in 2010. Approximately $1.6 billion of our net operating loss carryforwards relates to tax deductible stock-based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. To the extent that net operating loss carryforwards, if realized, relate to stock-based compensation, the resulting tax benefits will be recorded to stockholders’ equity, rather than to results of operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13—Income Taxes” for additional information. Net Income (Loss) Although we reported net income for the year ended 2003, we believe that this net income result should not be viewed as a material positive event and is not necessarily predictive of future reported results for a variety of reasons. For example, had we not changed our intent as to the settlement of the intercompany balances during the fourth quarter, we would have had a small net loss for the year and our net income for the fourth quarter would have been reduced by almost 50%. Additionally, we are unable to forecast the effect on our future reported results of certain items, including the stock-based compensation associated with variable accounting treatment and the gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances that results from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These items represented significant quarterly charges and gains during 2003 and may result in significant charges or gains in future periods. 32 Table of Contents Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue was $38 million and $48 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Unearned revenue represents payments received by us in advance of our service obligations. As we continue to structure our agreements to align the timing of our cash receipts with the service provided, we expect that, over time, balances of unearned revenue may continue to decline. We believe this trend in unearned revenue is not significant relative to the trend in our cash flows or operating results. See “Net Sales and Gross Profit” above. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, “Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”) define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that certain of our financial measures which meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information to investors. We provide: “consolidated segment operating income (loss),” “pro forma net income (loss),” “pro forma net earnings (loss) per share,” and “free cash flow.” We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. For example, certain companies disclose a financial measure of earnings before certain charges such as interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. We considered the use of EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company as certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such as fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization of software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such as interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see “Reconciliation Tables” below. Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) We measure operating results of our segments using an internal performance measure of direct segment operating expenses that excludes: • Stock-based compensation; • Amortization of other intangibles; and • Restructuring-related and other. These operating expense line items are not allocated to segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated to segment results. The sum of our individual segment results is consolidated segment operating income (loss), which we reconcile to GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant to SEC staff interpretations of Regulation G, when presented in our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment 33 Table of Contents operating income is a GAAP financial measure; however, since we also present this financial measure outside the context of our financial statement footnotes, we have included this financial measure in our discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. We use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because it excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or that we believe are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both. Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Stock-Based Compensation We exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons: • Stock-based compensation expense is excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance, although we consider the dilutive impact to our investors when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly; • Stock-based compensation charges or gains are non-cash; and • The measurement of stock-based compensation is determined under a variety of methods depending on the underlying award. These methods include: (a) fixed accounting on stock options granted at market prices, resulting in no compensation expense, (b) variable accounting on certain stock options and restricted stock units, resulting in unpredictable charges or gains beyond our control, and (c) fixed accounting for certain restricted stock units, resulting in the estimated fair value of the award recognized over the service period. We record the employer portion of payroll tax expense, a cash expense, resulting from exercises of stock-based awards in “Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and do not include such expenses in “Stock-based compensation.” Amortization of Other Intangibles We exclude “Amortization of other intangibles” for the following reasons: • Amortization of other intangibles is excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance; • Amortization of other intangibles is a non-cash charge to current operations; and • Amortization of other intangibles has diminished, is currently immaterial, and is scheduled to fully amortize by the end of 2004. Restructuring-Related and Other We exclude restructuring-related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons: • We have implemented only one restructuring event in our history, which we announced in January 2001, and accordingly we believe internally that this line item is not as important to understanding our quarterly trends as other line items; • Since we do not regularly have restructuring-related charges, the exclusion of such charges from prior periods provides better comparability of our results of operations as viewed by management; and • Our restructuring-related and other charges have diminished, and except for periodic adjustments to our estimates that may be required from time to time, we do not currently expect to record additional restructuring-related charges in the foreseeable future. 34 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill If, in the future, we incur impairment losses on our goodwill, such charges would be excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would be non-cash, and not in the immediate control of management. We have elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter of each year. No indicators of impairment were identified during the year ended December 31, 2003. Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because it excludes “Stock-based compensation,” the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation on the face of our consolidated statements of operations and in the footnotes to our financial statements. We also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect on shareholders, in the footnotes to our financial statements. See Item 8 of Part II “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies” for presentation of our stock-based compensation expense calculated on a consistent basis for all awards using the fair value method as prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as well as total outstanding stock-based awards and related activity. Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes “Restructuring-related and other.” For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide an incomplete summary of ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, we compensate for this limitation by disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January 2001 restructuring event and by providing disclosure of future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Restructuring-Related and Other.” There can be no assurance that we will not undertake another restructuring event in the future that would affect future cash flows. If we have a restructuring event in the future, we will re-evaluate our decision to exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based on those future facts and circumstances at that time. Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss), including the related pro forma net earnings (loss) per share, which we reconcile to net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, in addition to the line items described above as excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items on our consolidated statements of operations: • Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other; • Equity in losses of equity-method investees, net; and • Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. We use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based on it, to manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision to use this financial measure is due to the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control or are not characteristic of our underlying business operations for the period in which they are recorded, or both. Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) See “Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)—Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)” for an explanation of “Stock-based compensation,” “Amortization of other intangibles,” “Restructuring-related and other,” and “Impairment of goodwill.” 35 Table of Contents Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and Other The majority of “Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other” consists of gains or charges due to our quarterly remeasurement of the principal of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars. We exclude the effect of these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes in exchange rates is inherently uncertain. These gains or charges would only affect near-term cash flows if we redeem or, in certain cases, restructure, our 6.875% PEACS in the next several years, rather than over a longer term or at maturity in 2010. Because these charges and gains vary based on exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. Additionally, we exclude gains or charges associated with remeasurements of foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. We exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult to predict for future periods. This line item also includes $24 million of losses associated with the redemption of our 10% Senior Discount Notes and a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and $6 million of losses associated with the termination of our Euro Currency Swap. Equity in Losses of Equity-Method Investees, Net We exclude equity in losses of equity-method investees, net, because it generates potential non-cash gains or losses, which are based on the financial results of other companies that we do not manage or control and are difficult to predict. In addition, we believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Finally, in recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, we expect this trend to continue. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle We exclude cumulative effect of change in accounting principle because it generates non-cash charges, which we believe are not indicative of our financial or operating performance. Limitations of Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations as consolidated segment operating income. See “Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)—Limitations of Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)” above. In addition, when the 6.875% PEACS are retired, whether by early redemption or restructuring, or at maturity in 2010, the foreign currency effect of changes in the exchange ratio between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro will result in a cash effect. We compensate for this limitation by disclosing the effect of currency movements on our 6.875% PEACS on our consolidated statements of operations and presenting the fair value of our 6.875% PEACS in the notes to our financial statements. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Other.” Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances where proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Limitations of Free Cash Flow Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

For the full year 2004, net sales are expected to be between $6.20 billion and $6.70 billion. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” Assuming among other things, and solely for purposes of this estimate, that we do not record any revisions to our restructuring-related estimates and that the closing price of our common stock on March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2004 is identical to the closing price of $52.62 on December 31, 2003, operating income for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be between $80 million and $100 million, and, for the full year of 2004, to be between $355 million and $455 million. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, “ Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” In addition, our GAAP operating projections are based on an assumption about our future stock price performance, which is required to estimate stock-based compensation and is difficult to accurately predict. First quarter of 2004 consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between $95 million and $115 million. For the full year 2004, consolidated segment operating income is expected to be between $430 million and $530 million. However, any such projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in A-rated or higher short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2003.

Our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of periodic interest payments and principal payments at maturity. The market value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $870 million and $531 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.06 billion (principal balance of $1.05 billion) and $925 million (principal balance of $1.25 billion) at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2003, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, and www.amazon.co.jp) accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca, are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites, and include Euros, British Pounds, Yen, and Canadian Dollars. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant transaction gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2003, International segment revenues improved $226 million and our operating results improved $15 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2003 of $764 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $38 million, $76 million, and $153 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance of 690 million Euros ($870 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2003). Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS’s principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in losses of approximately $43 million, $87 million, and $174 million, recorded to “Remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and other.” We are not hedged on interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 15% in 2004, we would incur $2 million, $4 million, and $6 million additional interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2003, our recorded basis in equity securities was $23 million, including $9 million classified as “Marketable securities” and $15 million classified as “Other equity investments.” We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. During 2003, we recorded impairment losses totaling $2 million, compared to $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, to write-down several of our equity securities to fair value. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2003 of $86 million (recorded basis of $16 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $13 million, $26 million and $43 million. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:49.494524

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the 25 Table of Contents amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1 of Part I, “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results,” which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors, publishers, and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. Our price reductions take several forms: we reduce the sales prices of products we sell, we recruit third-party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages, and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 434 million at December 31, 2004, compared with 433 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002. We seek to leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable costs per unit. Our customer experience costs, specifically the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers, are largely fixed in that they do not vary directly with sales. The customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs; credit-card processing fees; bad debt; picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment; transportation; customer service support; and most aspects of our marketing costs. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing; seek to maximize volume discounts available to us from suppliers; and focus on maintaining a lean culture, including by reducing defects in our processes. 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 26 Table of Contents Because we are able to turn our inventory quickly, we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 16, 18, 19 for 2004, 2003, and 2002. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third-party sales, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 53, 50, and 52 for 2004, 2003 and 2002. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third-party sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results, including trends. For example, our total revenue, profit, and operating and free cash flow have recently benefited significantly from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our internationally-focused websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to also evaluate our growth rates before the effect of currency changes. For example, while our revenues increased 31% during 2004 in comparison with the prior year, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 26%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local-currency growth rates. We may have significant variation in our future reported results. We believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed, on its own, as a material positive event, and the year-over-year increase in net income of $553 million is not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2004 we had a primarily non-cash net benefit from income taxes of $233 million resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities (“PEACS”) and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and changes in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 27 Table of Contents liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Under our Syndicated Stores arrangements, we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory, set prices, and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service, and the other business earns a sales commission. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for online DVD rentals and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from third-party sellers and similar amounts earned through our Merchant.com program are recognized when the item is sold by the third-party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. 28 Table of Contents Outbound shipping charges to customers are included in “Net sales” and, excluding amounts earned from third-party sellers where we don’t provide fulfillment services, amounted to $420 million, $372 million, and $365 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment-related services in connection with certain of our Merchants@ and Merchant.com programs. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third-party maintains ownership of the related products. Internal-Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. In accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. During 2004, 2003, and 2002 we capitalized $44 million, $30 million, and $25 million of costs associated with development of internal-use software, which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $30 million, $24 million, and $26 million. Restructuring Estimates Restructuring-related liabilities include estimates for, among other things, anticipated disposition of lease obligations. Key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated timing of sublease rentals, estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs, and estimates for brokerage and other related costs. We periodically evaluate and, if necessary, adjust our estimates based on currently-available information. Additionally, we may determine, as we did in 2004, that certain of the office space vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we have been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, may be necessary for our future needs. To the extent we elect to utilize this office space, we adjust our restructuring-related liability and classify future payments to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered long-term investments, in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders’ deficit as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation, any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net 29 Table of Contents income. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income” on our consolidated balance sheets. Resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates, we recorded gains of $41 million and $36 million for 2004 and 2003. Repayments among the entities during 2004 were $210 million. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax assets are $363 million, comprised of approximately $270 million relating to our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting. Classification of deferred tax assets between current and long-term categories is based on the expected timing of realization, and the valuation allowance is allocated on a pro-rata basis. We had a net tax benefit in 2004 of $233 million resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004. In connection with this assessment, we also recorded a net credit to “Stockholders’ Deficit” of $106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004. The range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide. For example, had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that a portion of our deferred tax asset will be realized, the amount recorded to “Provision (benefit) for income taxes” would have been an expense of $12 million (rather than a benefit of $233 million) for 2004. Alternatively, if we had concluded that the weight of available evidence supported a decision that substantially all of our deferred tax assets may be realized, we would have recorded a substantially larger credit to “Stockholders’ Deficit.” Significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and it is very difficult to predict when, if ever, our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow was $477 million for 2004 compared to $346 million for 2003, an increase of 38%. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of expense payments, discounts offered by vendors, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion at the end of 2004 and 2003. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $970 million and $764 million at the end of 2004 and 2003, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $567 million, $392 million, and $174 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers and third-party sellers, offset by cash payments we make to suppliers of products and services, employee compensation, credit card transaction fees, bad debt, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our statements of cash flows. 30 Table of Contents customers and third-party sellers generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels. During 2004, payments to product merchandise suppliers, which do not include payments to transportation suppliers, totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion over the prior year. The increase in payments to product merchandise suppliers corresponds with cost of sales, and with our efforts to add product categories, increase selection of products we offer for sale, improve availability in both existing and new product categories, and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers, and is also affected by foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development costs. Cash used in investing activities was $318 million in 2004 and $122 in 2002, while cash provided by investing activities was $237 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by maturities of marketable securities. Our capital expenditures, including internal-use software and website development, were $89 million, $46 million, and $39 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites over time. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. In September 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Joyo.com at a purchase price of $75 million, including a cash payment (net of cash acquired) of $71 million, the assumption of employee stock options, and transaction-related costs. Cash paid in connection with this acquisition is classified as cash provided by (used in) investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. The operating results of Joyo.com did not have a significant effect on consolidated results for 2004. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Business Acquisition.” Cash used in financing activities was $97 million in 2004 and $332 million in 2003. This compares to cash provided by financing activities of $107 million in 2002. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, which were $60 million in 2004, $163 million in 2003, and $122 million for 2002. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock-based awards. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations, which were $157 million in 2004, $495 million in 2003, and $15 million in 2002. During 2004, we paid $154 million, which includes a redemption premium of $4 million, to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (“4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes”). See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt and Other.” In 2004 we recorded a primarily non-cash net benefit of $233 million to “Provision (benefit) for income taxes” relating primarily to our valuation of deferred tax assets. We expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately $25 million, compared with $4 million in 2004. On March 7, 2005, we redeemed 200 million Euros principal of our 6.875% PEACS for a cash payment of $266 million, which includes $1 million of interest from and including February 16 through March 6, 2005. Under the Indenture, no premium was required. As of March 7, 2005, the outstanding principal amount of our 6.875% PEACS was 490 million Euros ($649 million using the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate on that date). Additionally, in March 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. 31 Table of Contents Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. We currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency effects on our interest or principal obligations relating to the 6.875% PEACS, and, as a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated interest payable are classified as “Other expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.

As of December 31, 2004, our principal debt obligation for the 6.875% PEACS has increased by $255 million since its issuance in February 2000 due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio. Additionally, on March 7, 2005, we redeemed 200 million Euros of our outstanding 6.875% PEACS, which is not reflected in the table above. (2) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2004, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate of $463 million. If we had applied to our operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $335 million of additional obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2004. (3) Consists primarily of legally-binding commitments to purchase inventory. Legally-binding commitments associated with non-inventory purchases are not significant. (4) Net of an estimated $20 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2004, we had signed sublease agreements totaling $13 million. 32 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge a portion of our marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements. The amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases; with fluctuations in our market capitalization, which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock; and based on our credit-rating. The change in the total amount of collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: StandbyLetters ofCredit (1) Line ofCredit (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in thousands) Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 60,799 $ — $ 25,936 $ 86,735 Net change in collateral pledged (10,383 ) 1,933 (4,412 ) (12,862 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 (4) $ 50,416 $ 1,933 $ 21,524 $ 73,873 (1) Pursuant to available standby letter-of-credit facilities totaling $151 million. (2) Pursuant to an available line of credit totaling $10 million. (3) The required amount of collateral to be pledged on certain of our real estate leases fluctuates based on our market capitalization. At December 31, 2004, our market capitalization was $18.1 billion. If our market capitalization decreases, the required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase $5 million (if market capitalization is less than $18 billion but more than $13 billion) or $11 million (if our market capitalization is less than $13 billion). (4) Includes $10 million of cash equivalents pledged as collateral. See “Note 2—Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities.” We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. 33 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net Sales: North America $ 3,847,344 $ 3,258,413 $ 2,761,457 International 3,073,780 2,005,286 1,171,479 Consolidated $ 6,921,124 $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 Net Sales Growth Rate: North America 18.1 % 18.0 % 12.2 % International 53.3 71.2 76.9 Consolidated 31.5 33.8 26.0 Net Sales Mix: North America 55.6 % 61.9 % 70.2 % International 44.4 38.1 29.8 Consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Revenue growth is due primarily to increased demand driven by increased selection, lower prices, including from our free shipping offers, and improved features and services available on our websites. Revenue growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” below for additional information on the effect on reported revenue of changes in exchange rates. Net sales from “Other” consist of non-retail activities, such as our Merchant.com program, miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities, and our co-branded credit card program. North America revenue growth rate in 2004 was consistent with 2003 at 18%, up from our 2002 growth rate of 12%. The increase in growth rates from 2002 reflects our efforts to increase product categories and selection available on our websites, and to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International revenue growth rate declined in 2004 and 2003 compared to the prior year periods, which reflects several factors. These factors include the increasing size of our business, which naturally causes growth rates to decline over time, offset by our customer experience initiatives including new category introductions; increased selection; the introduction of our third-party offerings in the UK, Germany, Japan, and France; and our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International segment revenue growth rates are also affected by changes in exchange rates. The relative mix of worldwide net sales attributed to our International segment continues to increase, and we expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated total. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines in our Electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. 34 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,023,552 $ 866,664 $ 740,985 International 578,445 390,504 251,633 Consolidated $ 1,601,997 $ 1,257,168 $ 992,618 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 18.1 % 17.0 % 12.7 % International 48.1 55.2 78.0 Consolidated 27.4 26.7 24.3 Gross Margin: North America 26.6 % 26.6 % 26.8 % International 18.8 19.5 21.5 Consolidated 23.1 23.9 25.2 The increases in gross profit in absolute terms during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior year periods correspond with increased revenue, including from increased sales volume by third-party sellers, offset by our year-round free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product and geographic mix of sales during the year; sales volumes by third-party sellers; changes in vendor pricing; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping offers. Free shipping offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Additionally, in 2005, we introduced a new shipping membership program, Amazon Prime, in which members receive free two-day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. North America segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003, with each of these years down slightly from 2002. Changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers, including from our year-round free shipping offers, were offset partially by increased sales volume by third-party sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers. International segment gross margins declined during 2004 and 2003 compared to prior periods resulting from our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers, and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories, offset partially by increases in sales volume by third-party sellers. Sales of products by third-party sellers on our websites continue to increase, representing 26%, 22%, and 17% of unit sales in 2004, 2003, and 2002. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. If product sales by third-party sellers continue to increase, we anticipate the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will partially offset the effect on our gross margins of our strategy to lower prices for customers over time by offering additional or broader price reductions, free shipping offers, and other promotions. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” below for additional information on the effect on reported gross profit of changes in exchange rates. 35 Table of Contents Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue $ 420,053 $ 372,000 $ 364,749 Outbound shipping costs (616,572 ) (508,468 ) (404,303 ) Net shipping cost $ (196,519 ) $ (136,468 ) $ (39,554 ) We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products. Additionally, in 2005, we continued to lower prices, including by introducing a new shipping membership program, Amazon Prime, in which members receive free two-day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. We seek to partially offset these costs over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies, including by reducing split-shipments. 36 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net Sales: North America Media $ 2,589,438 $ 2,269,472 $ 1,994,949 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,127,754 878,519 681,041 Other 130,152 110,422 85,467 Total North America $ 3,847,344 $ 3,258,413 $ 2,761,457 International Media $ 2,512,911 $ 1,779,476 $ 1,103,665 Electronics and other general merchandise 558,490 224,606 65,877 Other 2,379 1,204 1,937 Total International $ 3,073,780 $ 2,005,286 $ 1,171,479 Consolidated Media $ 5,102,349 $ 4,048,948 $ 3,098,614 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,686,244 1,103,125 746,918 Other 132,531 111,626 87,404 Total consolidated $ 6,921,124 $ 5,263,699 $ 3,932,936 Net Sales Growth Rate: North America Media 14.1 % 13.8 % 10.2 % Electronics and other general merchandise 28.4 29.0 17.9 Other 17.9 29.2 17.7 Total North America 18.1 18.0 12.2 International Media 41.2 % 61.2 % 71.0 % Electronics and other general merchandise 148.7 240.9 308.3 Other 97.6 (37.8 ) 279.8 Total International 53.3 71.2 76.9 Consolidated Media 26.0 % 30.7 % 26.2 % Electronics and other general merchandise 52.9 47.7 25.8 Other 18.7 27.7 19.5 Total consolidated 31.5 33.8 26.0 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 73.7 % 76.9 % 78.8 % Electronics and other general merchandise 24.4 21.0 19.0 Other 1.9 2.1 2.2 Total consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % North America 55.6 % 61.9 % 70.2 % International 44.4 38.1 29.8 Total consolidated 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 37 Table of Contents Direct Segment Operating Expenses Information about the operating expense categories that we allocate to our segment results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Segment Operating Expenses: North America $ 702,676 $ 583,619 $ 561,318 International 409,158 312,311 251,198 Percent of Net Sales: North America 18.3 % 17.9 % 20.3 % International 13.3 15.6 21.4 Segment Operating Expenses: Fulfillment (1) $ 590,397 $ 477,032 $ 392,467 Marketing (2) 158,022 122,787 125,383 Technology and content (3) 251,195 207,809 215,617 General and administrative (4) 112,220 88,302 79,049 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment (1) 8.5 % 9.1 % 10.0 % Marketing (2) 2.3 2.3 3.2 Technology and content (3) 3.6 3.9 5.5 General and administrative (4) 1.6 1.7 2.0 Year-over-year Percentage Change: Fulfillment (1) 24 % 22 % 5 % Marketing (2) 29 (2 ) (9 ) Technology and content (3) 21 (4 ) (11 ) General and administrative (4) 27 12 (12 ) (1) Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in comparison with the prior year relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume; our mix of product sales; costs associated with credit card fees; and bad debt costs, including costs of our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell. Additionally, since credit card fees associated with third-party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and bad debt costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our increasing third-party sales result in increasing fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. Also, during the third quarter of 2004 we began operation of a new European fulfillment center in Scotland and plan to expand our fulfillment capacity in Japan in 2005. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales decreased due to improvements in productivity and accuracy, the increase in units fulfilled, which leverages the fixed-cost portion of our fulfillment network, efficiencies gained through utilization of fulfillment services provided by third parties, a decline in customer service contacts per unit resulting from improvements in our operations, and enhancements to our customer self-service features, offset partially by increases in credit card fees and bad debt, including costs of our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions. We expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment to increase over time. (2) Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, portal advertising, e-mail campaigns, and other initiatives. Since our marketing expenses are largely variable, we expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing 38 Table of Contents expense. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2004 corresponding with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping as an effective worldwide marketing tool, and intend to continue offering it indefinitely. (3) Technology and Content Our spending in technology and content has increased as we are adding computer scientists and software engineers to continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and to improve our process efficiency. Additionally, we continue to invest in several areas of technology, including seller platform; A9.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary focused on search technology on www.A9.com, www.amazon.com, and other Amazon sites; web services; and digital initiatives. During 2004, 2003, and 2002 we capitalized $44 million, $30 million, and $25 million of costs associated with development of internal-use software, which is offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $30 million, $24 million, and $26 million. We intend to continue investing in these and other initiatives and expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff. A significant majority of these costs are incurred in the United States and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. (4) General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative is primarily due to increases in professional fees and litigation costs. We expect absolute dollars spent in general and administrative to increase over time. On an annual basis in 2004, each category of direct segment operating expenses has either declined or remained flat with 2003 as a percentage of net sales. However, for the fourth quarter of 2004 expenses for “Marketing” and “Technology and content” as a percentage of net sales increased in comparison to same period in 2003, and this trend may continue. Stock-Based Compensation On October 13, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on the effective date for SFAS No. 123R (SFAS 123R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123R requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share-based awards at fair value beginning on July 1, 2005, however we will early-adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R with an implementation date of January 1, 2005. The adoption of this standard will not affect the stock-based compensation associated with our restricted stock and restricted stock units which are already recorded at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period, but will result in the recognition of stock-based compensation in future periods for remaining unvested stock options as of the effective date. As of the implementation date of this standard, we will no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. We estimate that stock-based compensation for 2005 will be $115 million. See also Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies–Stock-based Compensation” for our SFAS No. 123 pro forma disclosures using fair value accounting treatment. 39 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Stock awards—variable accounting (1) $ 4,577 $ 51,875 $ 60,130 Fixed accounting (2): Restricted stock units (3) 48,625 30,691 3,913 Restricted stock (4) 4,500 5,185 4,884 Total stock-based compensation $ 57,702 $ 87,751 $ 68,927 (1) Variable accounting treatment results in expense or contra-expense recognition using the cumulative expense method, calculated based on the quoted price of our common stock and vesting schedules of underlying awards. To the extent stock options are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “Stock-based compensation.” (2) The fair value of awards is determined at grant date based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the accelerated method under FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. To the extent awards are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. (3) Since October 2002, we have awarded restricted stock units as our primary form of stock-based compensation. (4) Includes expense associated with matching contributions of 0.07 million and 0.03 million shares of our common stock under our 401(k) savings plan during 2004 and 2003. No matching contributions were made in 2002. At December 31, 2004, we had 25 million stock awards outstanding, including 18 million stock options with a $12.98 weighted average exercise price; 6 million restricted stock units; and 1 million shares of restricted stock. Common shares outstanding (which include restricted stock) plus shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units totaled 434 million and 433 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. For additional information about our stock-based compensation and awards see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-based Compensation.” Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense (income) was $(8) million, $3 million, and $47 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, which includes restructuring-related expenses (credits) and amortization of other intangibles. Restructuring-related expenses (credits) were $(9) million, $0 million, and $42 million; and amortization of other intangibles was $1 million, $3 million, and $5 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, was necessary for our future needs. We have reduced our restructuring-related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million in 2004. Lease-related payments for this office space, approximately $0.8 million per quarter, are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. These efforts were primarily focused on eliminating French office positions in managerial, professional, clerical, and technical roles. The number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in “Other operating expense (income)” on the consolidated statements of operations. 40 Table of Contents Cash payments resulting from our operational restructurings were $9 million, $26 million, and $45 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Based on currently available information, we estimate the remaining restructuring-related cash outflows will be as follows: Leases Other Total (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2005 $ 3,057 $ 1,910 $ 4,967 2006 1,903 — 1,903 2007 1,843 — 1,843 2008 1,497 — 1,497 2009 1,374 — 1,374 Thereafter 1,305 — 1,305 Total estimated cash outflows (1) $ 10,979 $ 1,910 $ 12,889 (1) Cash flows are presented net of an estimated $20 million in sublease rentals. At December 31, 2004, we had signed contractual sublease agreements totaling $13 million. For additional information about our operational restructuring, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Other Operating Expense (Income).” Income from Operations Our income from operations was $440 million, $271 million, and $64 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002. These increases primarily result from net sales and gross profit growth and declines in operating expenses as a percent of net sales as we leverage the fixed cost portion of our cost structure and seek to improve our variable costs through process efficiencies. Additionally, in 2004 and 2003 operating income improved from year-over-year reductions of $47 million and $8 million in stock-based compensation expense associated with variable accounting, offset by increases in stock-based compensation of $18 million and $27 million associated with restricted stock units. Net Interest Expense The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments, including $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and 690 million Euros ($935 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2004) of 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2004. Interest expense was $107 million, $130 million, and $143 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $150 million and $464 million in 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004, our total long-term indebtedness was $1.86 billion compared to $1.95 billion a year ago. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt and Other.” We generally invest our excess cash in “A” rated or higher short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them. 41 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Gains on sales of marketable securities, net $ 586 $ 9,598 $ 5,700 Foreign-currency transaction losses, net (5,214 ) (3,043 ) (1,086 ) Other miscellaneous gains (losses), net (73 ) (41 ) 309 Total other income (expense), net $ (4,701 ) $ 6,514 $ 4,923 Foreign-currency transaction losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS. Since these payments are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable (which is paid annually in February) is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Foreign-currency losses on remeasurement of 6.875%PEACS (1) $ (65,375 ) $ (140,130 ) $ (103,136 ) Gains on sales of Euro-denominated investments, net 9,469 5,827 2,227 Gains on sales of equity investments, net 15,406 796 13,044 Loss on redemption of long-term debt (5,672 ) (23,829 ) — Loss on termination of Euro Currency Swap (2) — (5,880 ) — Foreign-currency effect on intercompany balances (3) 40,883 35,574 — Other-than-temporary impairments and other (4) 4,465 (2,455 ) (12,577 ) Total remeasurements and other $ (824 ) $ (130,097 ) $ (100,442 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the remaining basis at date of termination of our Euro Currency Swap that previously was designated as a cash flow hedge of a portion of our 6.875% PEACS principal and interest. (3) Represents the gains associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See “Item 8 of Part II—Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” (4) Included in 2004 is a gain of $6 million relating to the settlement of a contractual dispute, and included in 2003 and 2002 is $0.4 million and $4 million of losses from equity-method investees. No equity-method losses or income were recorded in 2004. Income Taxes We record a tax provision or benefit for current and deferred U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes for all periods presented, classified as “Provision (benefit) for income taxes” on the consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, 42 Table of Contents including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and it is very difficult to predict when, if ever, our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets are realizable. We had a net current tax benefit in 2004 of $233 million, representing $0.57 and $0.55 of basic and diluted earnings per share, resulting primarily from the effect of changes in our valuation assessment of deferred tax assets during 2004. In connection with this assessment we also recorded a net credit to “Stockholders’ Deficit” of $106 million on our consolidated balance sheet in 2004. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax assets are $363 million, comprised of approximately $270 million relating to our NOLs, with the remaining portion related to temporary timing differences between tax and financial reporting. Classification of deferred tax assets between current and long-term categories is based on the expected timing of realization, and the valuation allowance is allocated ratably. At December 31, 2004, our gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs were approximately $800 million (relating to approximately $2.6 billion of NOLs), offset by a valuation allowance of approximately $530 million due to uncertainty about their future realization. If in the future, we determine that the remaining $530 million of NOL deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realizable, substantially all would be credited to “Stockholders’ Deficit” rather than the income statement since they primarily relate to tax-deductible stock-based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. The majority of our NOLs expire after 2016. We also have approximately $70 million of deferred tax assets relating to approximately $225 million capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2005 and thereafter. Due to uncertainty regarding future realization, we have provided a full valuation allowance for this portion of our deferred tax asset. Additionally, we expect net income for 2005 to decline because we expect a tax provision in 2005 rather than the large tax benefit we received in 2004. We expect our cash taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately $25 million, compared with $4 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003. Net Income Net income was $588 million and $35 million in 2004 and 2003, and net loss was $149 million in 2002. We believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed, on its own, as a material positive event, and the year-over-year increases in net income of $553 million and $184 million in 2004 and 2003 are not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2004 we had a net benefit from income taxes of $233 million, representing $0.57 and $0.55 of basic and diluted earnings per share, resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. 43 Table of Contents Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Exchange-rate effect on (1): Net sales $ 275,653 $ 232,370 $ 46,950 Gross profit 52,183 46,392 9,930 Operating expenses 32,011 32,054 6,039 Operating income 20,172 14,338 3,891 Net interest expense and other 8,801 11,135 2,393 Remeasurements and other (2) 15,023 98,729 100,879 Net income (loss) (3,652 ) (95,526 ) (99,381 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.01 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (0.26 ) (1) Represents the effect on reported results due to year-over-year changes in exchange rates. Absent year-over-year changes in exchange rates, reported amounts would have been lower (higher) by these amounts. (2) Includes foreign-currency gains (losses) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances, and realized currency-related gains associated with sales of Euro-denominated investments held by a U.S. functional-currency subsidiary. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Remeasurements and Other.” Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Free Cash Flow Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other provisions of the 1934 Act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions such as our 2004 acquisition of Joyo.com (see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies”). Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 44 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Cash provided by operating activities” for 2004, 2003, and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 566,560 $ 392,022 $ 174,291 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (89,133 ) (45,963 ) (39,163 ) Free cash flow $ 477,427 $ 346,059 $ 135,128 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (317,631 ) $ 236,651 $ (121,684 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (97,292 ) $ (331,986 ) $ 106,894 Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 2, 2005 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2005 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $1.80 billion and $1.95 billion, or grow between 18% and 27%, compared with first quarter 2004. • Operating income is expected to be between $80 million and $110 million, or decline between (28%) and 0%, compared with first quarter 2004, assuming, among other things, that the Company adopts SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2005, stock-based compensation is $25 million, and there are no further revisions to restructuring-related estimates. Full Year 2005 Expectations • Net sales are expected to be between $8.05 billion and $8.65 billion, or grow between 16% and 25%. • Operating income is expected to be between $385 million and $510 million, or between (13%) and 16% growth, compared with 2004, assuming, among other things, that the Company adopts SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2005, stock-based compensation is $115 million, and there are no further revisions to restructuring-related estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part 1, “Business — Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” above. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in “A” rated or higher, short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual 45 Table of Contents funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2004 (in thousands, except percentages): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2004 Commercial paper and short-term obligations $ 122,073 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 122,073 $ 124,215 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % — — — — — 2.10 % Certificates of deposit 496,412 — — — — — 496,412 496,412 Weighted average interest rate 2.52 % — — — — — 2.52 % Corporate notes and bonds 240,213 3,760 2,900 8,000 13,390 — 268,263 275,058 Weighted average interest rate 2.25 % 3.45 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % — 2.43 % Asset-backed and agency securities 136,202 134,754 21,127 21,570 8,500 — 322,153 323,245 Weighted average interest rate 2.32 % 4.01 % 3.58 % 3.00 % 3.00 % — 3.17 % Treasury notes and bonds 11,845 67,205 32,620 21,100 10,500 — 143,270 140,728 Weighted average interest rate 2.43 % 2.87 % 3.18 % 3.00 % 3.00 % — 2.93 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,006,745 $ 205,719 $ 56,647 $ 50,670 $ 32,390 $ — $ 1,352,171 $ 1,359,658 46 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2003 (in thousands, except percentages): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2003 Commercial paper and short-term obligations $ 675,061 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 675,061 $ 675,061 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % — — — — — 2.00 % Certificates of deposit 27,395 — — — — — 27,395 27,395 Weighted average interest rate 2.00 % — — — — — 2.00 % Corporate notes and bonds 11,280 2,000 8,520 2,330 — — 24,130 24,997 Weighted average interest rate 1.34 % 1.51 % 1.96 % 1.96 % — — 1.68 % Asset-backed and agency securities 20,700 18,875 30,370 14,440 — — 84,385 85,692 Weighted average interest rate 1.22 % 1.88 % 2.03 % 2.32 % — — 1.83 % Treasury notes and bonds 4,000 6,751 95,770 37,600 — — 144,121 145,778 Weighted average interest rate 1.12 % 1.59 % 1.50 % 2.12 % — — 1.96 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 738,436 $ 27,626 $ 134,660 $ 54,370 $ — $ — $ 955,092 $ 958,923 At December 31, 2004, we had long-term debt of $1.86 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was 691 million Euros ($936 million) and 690 million Euros ($870 million) at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $907 million (outstanding principal of $900 million) and $1.06 billion (outstanding principal of $1.05 billion) at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2004, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 44% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and include Euros, British Pounds, Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Chinese Yuan. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2004, International segment revenues improved $271 million and our operating results improved $20 million in comparison with the prior year. 47 Table of Contents We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2004 of $970 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $49 million, $97 million, and $194 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2004 of 690 million Euros ($935 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2004). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $255 million as of December 31, 2004. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS’ principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $47 million, $94 million, and $187 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2004, we would incur $3 million, $6 million, and $13 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. See also Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15—Subsequent Events (Unaudited).” Investment Risk As of December 31, 2004, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly-traded and private companies) was $27 million, including $12 million classified as “Marketable securities,” and $15 million classified as “Other assets.” We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company-specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2004 of $64 million (recorded basis of $20 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $19 million, and $32 million. 48 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:50.271179
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, 24 Table of Contents fulfillment center optimization, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, risks of inventory management, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A. of Part I, “Risk Factors,” which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors, publishers, and manufacturers and products offered by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. We offer services such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co-branded credit cards, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping our operating costs low, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives including hiring additional software engineers and computer scientists. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than margin percentages. Because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards, the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is less than our income tax provision. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders’. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002 because we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded over the underlying service periods, net of estimated cancellations. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 438 million at December 31, 2005, compared with 434 million at December 31, 2004 and 433 million at December 31, 2003. These totals include all stock awards outstanding, without regard for estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards, and in-the-money and out-of-the-money stock options. We seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs. Our customer experience variable costs include product costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 25 Table of Contents Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a negative operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 14, 16, and 18 for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third-party sales, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 54, 53, and 50 for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third-party sales, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency, enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms, search, web services, and digital initiatives. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 26 Table of Contents to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Under our Syndicated Stores arrangements, we record gross product sales and costs since we own the inventory, set prices, and are responsible for fulfillment and customer service, and the other business earns a sales commission. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for online DVD rentals, Amazon Prime, and other membership programs, are deferred and classified in “Unearned revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from third-party sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the third-party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment-related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. 27 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment-related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third-party maintains ownership of the related products. Internal-Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. During 2005, 2004 and 2003 we capitalized $90 million (including $11 million of stock-based compensation), $44 million, and $30 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development, which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $50 million, $30 million and $24 million. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances A provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, requires that gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions considered long-term investments, in which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, be excluded in the determination of net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, currency adjustments for these intercompany balances were recorded to stockholders’ equity (deficit) as translation adjustments and not included in the determination of net income because we intended to permanently invest such amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made the decision that these amounts would be repaid among the entities and, accordingly, upon consolidation, any exchange gain or loss arising from remeasurements of intercompany balances is required to be recorded in the determination of net income. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, currency adjustments arising before the fourth quarter of 2003 continue to be included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income” on our consolidated balance sheets. Resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany balances using exchange rates at the reporting dates, we recorded a loss of $47 million in 2005, and gains of $41 million and $36 million in 2004 and 2003. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. At December 31, 2005, our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance, were $291 million, which includes $123 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) that are primarily attributed to stock-based compensation. The majority of our NOLs begin to expire in 2016. Additionally, we have elected to present our NOL deferred tax assets attributed to stock-based compensation net of the related allowance as of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Total gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs at December 31, 2005 were $616 million (relating to approximately $1.9 billion of NOLs). 28 Table of Contents SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. We recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of $90 million, representing $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share, as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. The range of possible judgments relating to valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide. For example, had we determined that the weight of available evidence did not support a decision that these deferred tax assets are realizable; the “Provision (benefit) for income taxes” would have been an expense of $185 million for 2005 rather than an expense of $95 million for the same period. At December 31, 2005 we continue to have a valuation allowance of $213 million, which relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the occurrence of future capital gains. Stock-Based Compensation As of January 1, 2005, we early adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. Free cash flow was $529 million for 2005, which includes the effect of a $40 million patent litigation settlement, compared to $477 million and $347 million for 2004 and 2003. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, the timing of expense payments, discounts offered by vendors, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $905 million and $970 million at the end of 2005 and 2004, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was presented in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. SFAS 123(R) supersedes prior guidance and requires tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation. Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $7 million, $8 million, and $4 million for December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow. We expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of $100 million, although the actual amount 1 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 29 Table of Contents is subject to considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results; however, the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification. Cash provided by operating activities was $733 million, $566 million, and $393 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from third-party sellers, and from non-retail activities such as through our co-branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98-1 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, third-party sellers and non-retail activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid to inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost of sales, adjusted for increases or decreases in inventory and payable levels as well as increases or decreases in vendor-related receivables for co-operative marketing, volume rebates, and other incentives. During 2005, cash paid to inventory suppliers, totaled $5.5 billion, compared to $4.6 billion and $3.4 billion in 2004 and 2003. Cash paid to inventory suppliers is also affected by our efforts to add product categories, increase selection of products we offer for sale, improve availability in both existing and new product categories, and take advantage of additional discounts offered to us by suppliers. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Other Operating Expense (Income).” Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, net cash flows from acquisitions, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development costs. Net cash used in investing activities was $778 million and $317 million in 2005 and 2004, while cash provided by investing activities was $236 million in 2003 with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $204 million, $89 million and $46 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites, as well as investments in fulfillment-related assets and technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures included $79 million, $44 million and $30 million for internal-use software and website development during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We believe our expenditures for repairs and improvements are sufficient to keep our facilities and equipment in suitable operating condition. We also purchased certain companies in 2005 and 2004 resulting in cash payments, net of acquired cash, of $24 million and $71 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $193 million, $97 million, and $332 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations, which were $270 million in 2005, $157 million in 2004, and $495 million in 2003. During 2005, we repaid €200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $265 million. During 2004, we repaid $154 million to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt and Other.” Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, which were $66 million, $60 million, and $163 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock-based awards. In 2005 we recorded a net tax provision of $95 million, and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of $233 million. A majority of this provision and benefit is non-cash as we have deferred tax assets resulting from our history of net operating losses. In February 2006, we announced plans to redeem €250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 7, 2006, for a cash payment of approximately $305 million (at the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on January 31, 2006), which includes $1 million of interest. Under the indenture governing the 6.875% PEACS, no premium is required. 30 Table of Contents Additionally, in February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a new debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated interest payable are classified as “Other income, net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Our inventory turnover was 14 and 16 for 2005 and 2004. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third-party sales, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers, among other factors. The decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on maintaining wide merchandise selection of in-stock inventory, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal and other (1) $ 14 $ 1 $ 2 $ 902 $ 587 $ 17 $ 1,523 Debt interest (1) 83 83 83 61 40 — 350 Capital leases 2 1 1 1 1 1 7 Operating leases (2)(3) 129 115 78 65 51 157 595 Purchase obligations (4) 289 12 8 8 8 8 333 Total commitments $ 517 $ 212 $ 172 $ 1,037 $ 687 $ 183 $ 2,808 (1) At December 31, 2005, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.1843. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $97 million as of December 31, 2005. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Additionally, on March 7, 2006, we will redeem €250 million of our outstanding 6.875% PEACS, which is not reflected in the table above. (2) Pursuant to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, lease agreements are categorized at their inception as either operating or capital leases depending on certain defined criteria. Although operating leases represent obligations for us, pursuant to SFAS No. 13 they are not reflected on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2005, we have remaining obligations under operating leases for equipment and real estate totaling $595 million. If we had applied to our equipment operating leases the same convention used for capital leases, which, however, would not be in accordance with GAAP, we would have recorded approximately $90 million of additional obligations on our balance sheet at December 31, 2005. (3) Includes $9 million related to restructuring-related leases and other commitments, consisting of $4 million due within 12 months and included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities,” and $5 million due after 12 months and included in “Long-term debt and other” on our balance sheets. These amounts are net of anticipated sublease income of $4 million. (4) Consists of legally-binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non-inventory commitments. 31 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge a portion of our cash equivalents or marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations and for real estate lease agreements. The amount required to be pledged for real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases; with fluctuations in our market capitalization, which is common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock; and based on our credit-rating. Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: StandbyLetters ofCredit (1) Line ofCredit (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 50 $ 2 $ 22 $ 74 Net change in collateral pledged 9 12 (4 ) 17 Balance at December 31, 2005 (4) $ 59 $ 14 $ 18 $ 91 (1) Pursuant to available standby letter-of-credit facilities totaling $139 million. (2) Pursuant to an available line of credit totaling $13 million, whereby collateral is required to be pledged at 110% of the outstanding balance. (3) The required amount of collateral to be pledged on certain of our real estate leases fluctuates based on our market capitalization. At December 31, 2005, our market capitalization was $19.6 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion. (4) Includes $19 million of cash equivalents pledged as collateral. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities.” We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1 of Part I, “Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. 32 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 4,711 $ 3,847 $ 3,259 International 3,779 3,074 2,005 Consolidated $ 8,490 $ 6,921 $ 5,264 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 22 % 18 % 18 % International 23 53 71 Consolidated 23 31 34 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 22 % 18 % 18 % International 25 40 52 Consolidated 24 26 28 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 56 % 62 % International 45 44 38 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 23% in 2005, due to an acceleration of revenue growth in our North America segment, offset by slower revenue growth in our International segment, representing a decrease from 31% revenue growth in 2004 and 34% revenue growth in 2003. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, revenue growth was 24%, 26%, and 28% for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Changes in currency exchange rates negatively affected 2005 net sales by $73 million, and positively affected net sales by $276 million and $232 million for 2004 and 2003. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth by changes in exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America revenue growth rates increased to 22% in 2005, compared to 18% growth rates in 2004 and 2003. The increased growth rate primarily reflects an increase in unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and by increased selection such as through additions to our product categories, as well as increases in our service-related revenues, particularly from Amazon Enterprise Solutions and from our co-branded credit card agreement. Changes in currency exchange rates positively affected 2005, 2004, and 2003 net sales for our North America segment by $5 million, $5 million, and $6 million. International revenue growth rates declined to 23% in 2005, compared to 53% and 71% growth rates in 2004 and 2003. This decrease in revenue growth is primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates, which negatively affected revenue growth by $78 million for 2005 and positively affected revenue growth by $271 million and $226 million for 2004 and 2003. Additionally, revenue growth was affected by declining revenue growth rates in certain product categories, primarily media. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, revenue growth was 25%, 40%, and 52% for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We endeavor to increase sales over time by continuing to offer low prices, including from free shipping, convenience, including new and innovative features such as personalization, 1-Click, and Search Inside the Book, and broad product availability and selection, including from new product categories and from third-party sales. 33 Table of Contents We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our Electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See “Supplemental Information” below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,267 $ 1,024 $ 867 International 772 578 390 Consolidated $ 2,039 $ 1,602 $ 1,257 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 24 % 18 % 17 % International 33 48 55 Consolidated 27 27 27 Gross Margin: North America 26.9 % 26.6 % 26.6 % International 20.4 18.8 19.5 Consolidated 24.0 23.1 23.9 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2005, compared to 2004 and 2003, corresponds with increases in sales, including increases in sales by third-party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co-branded credit card agreements, and increases in amounts earned from Amazon Enterprise Solutions, offset by our free shipping offers and lower prices for customers. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by third-party sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and membership offers. Such free shipping and membership offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. Amazon Prime, introduced in 2005, is a shipping membership program in which members receive free two-day shipping and discounted overnight shipping. We have offered free membership trials for Amazon Prime, and we expect to continue to offer these trials in the future. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by third-party sellers on our websites continue to increase, representing 28%, 26%, and 22% of unit sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. If product sales by third-party sellers continue to increase, the higher gross margin attributes of these sales will offset decreases in our gross margins due to lowering prices for customers over time by offering price reductions, free shipping offers, and promotions. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in sales by third-party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co-branded credit card agreement, and increases in amounts earned from service agreements, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party. 34 Table of Contents North America segment gross margin in 2004 was consistent with 2003. Changes in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories and price reductions for our customers, including from our year-round free shipping offers, were offset partially by increased sales volume by third-party sellers and volume discounts we receive from our product suppliers. International segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting from several factors including increasing sales by third-party sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers, offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our year-round free shipping offers. International segment gross margins in 2004 declined 70 basis points compared to 2003 resulting from efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers, and from a shift in mix of product sales towards lower gross margin product categories, offset partially by increases in sales volume by third-party sellers. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 511 $ 420 $ 372 Outbound shipping costs (750 ) (617 ) (508 ) Net shipping cost $ (239 ) $ (197 ) $ (136 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 22 % 13 % 2 % Outbound shipping costs 22 21 26 Net shipping cost 22 44 245 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 6.0 % 6.1 % 7.1 % Outbound shipping costs (8.8 ) (8.9 ) (9.7 ) Net shipping cost (2.8 )% (2.8 )% (2.6 )% (1) Outbound shipping charges to customers do not include amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership program. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. In addition, we anticipate that the costs of lowering prices over time will be partially mitigated to the extent product sales by third-party sellers continue to increase. 35 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 3,046 $ 2,589 $ 2,270 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,443 1,128 879 Other (1) 222 130 110 Total North America $ 4,711 $ 3,847 $ 3,259 International Media $ 2,885 $ 2,513 $ 1,779 Electronics and other general merchandise 886 559 225 Other (1) 8 2 1 Total International $ 3,779 $ 3,074 $ 2,005 Consolidated Media $ 5,931 $ 5,102 $ 4,049 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,329 1,687 1,104 Other (1) 230 132 111 Total consolidated $ 8,490 $ 6,921 $ 5,264 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 18 % 14 % 14 % Electronics and other general merchandise 28 28 29 Other 71 18 29 Total North America 22 18 18 International Media 15 % 41 % 61 % Electronics and other general merchandise 59 149 241 Other 234 98 (38 ) Total International 23 53 71 Consolidated Media 16 % 26 % 31 % Electronics and other general merchandise 38 53 48 Other 74 19 28 Total consolidated 23 32 34 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 70 % 74 % 77 % Electronics and other general merchandise 27 24 21 Other 3 2 2 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as our co-branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 36 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation was as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 $ 601 $ (10 ) $ 591 $ 495 $ (18 ) $ 477 Marketing 198 (6 ) 192 162 (4 ) 158 128 (5 ) 123 Technology and content 451 (45 ) 406 283 (32 ) 251 257 (50 ) 207 General and administrative 166 (20 ) 146 124 (12 ) 112 104 (15 ) 89 Other operating expense 47 — 47 (8 ) — (8 ) 3 — 3 Total operating expenses $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 $ 1,162 $ (58 ) $ 1,104 $ 987 $ (88 ) $ 899 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 24 % 23 % 21 % 24 % 22 % 22 % Marketing 22 22 27 29 (1 ) (2 ) Technology and content 59 62 10 21 2 (4 ) General and administrative 34 30 20 27 8 12 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.8 % 8.6 % 8.7 % 8.5 % 9.4 % 9.1 % Marketing 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.3 Technology and content 5.3 4.8 4.1 3.6 4.9 3.9 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 1.8 1.6 2.0 1.7 See Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2005 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment includes stock-based compensation of $16 million, $10 million, and $18 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to reduce customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. The mix of product sales affects fulfillment costs per shipment based on variations in shape and weight of products we sell. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with third-party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs and our A to Z Guarantee costs associated with these transactions are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our increasing third-party sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2005 and 2004 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space. We plan to continue expanding our world-wide fulfillment capacity in order to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties where we provide the fulfillment. We expect absolute amounts spent in fulfillment and fulfillment-related cost of sales to increase over time. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, sponsored search, portal advertising, e-mail campaigns, 37 Table of Contents and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. Marketing includes stock-based compensation of $6 million, $4 million, and $5 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003. These increases correspond with revenue growth as we utilized variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. We expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time. Technology and Content We significantly increased our spending in technology and content in 2005, which corresponds with our focus on several technology initiatives. We have added a significant number of computer scientists and software engineers to our staff so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience on our websites and those websites powered by us, improve our process efficiency, and invest in several areas of technology including seller platforms, search, web services, and digital initiatives. We believe these initiatives that we are funding are important to our longer-term success. See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” for a discussion of how management views the competitive landscape and importance of innovation. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff, and expect absolute amounts spent in technology and content to increase over time. Technology and content includes stock-based compensation of $45 million, $32 million, and $50 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. For the years ended 2005, 2004, and 2003, we capitalized $90 million (including $11 million of stock-based compensation), $44 million, and $30 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development, which are partially offset by amortization of previously capitalized amounts of $50 million, $30 million, and $24 million. Fixed assets associated with capitalized internal-use software, content, and website development, net of accumulated depreciation, were $87 million and $47 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Capitalized internal-use software is amortized over a useful life of two years. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, professional fees, and legal costs, offset by a $12 million credit in 2005 for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us. General and administrative includes stock-based compensation of $20 million, $12 million, and $15 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003. We expect absolute amounts spent in general and administrative to increase over time. Stock-Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based awards under the intrinsic value method, which followed the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and for stock options to the extent option 38 Table of Contents exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant. Also, to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer, other modifications, or performance criteria, such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment. To the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses. As of January 1, 2005, we early adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method under SFAS 123(R). The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a benefit of $10 million, $6 million net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, representing the cumulative effect of slightly increasing the rate of forfeitures expected over the life of issued stock awards based on our historical experience. Additionally, because we implemented SFAS 123(R), we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was presented in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows, in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 00-15, Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option. SFAS 123(R) supersedes EITF 00-15, amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows, and requires tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation. Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $7 million, $8 million, and $4 million for December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, with the amount for 2005 treated as financing cash flows to the detriment of operating cash flow. We expect the corresponding amount for 2006 to increase substantially and possibly be in excess of $100 million, although the actual amount is subject to considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for 2006 will be negatively effected in comparison to prior results; however, the underlying economic substance is not effected by this change in reporting classification. On March 29, 2005, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides the Staff’s views on a variety of matters relating to stock-based payments. SAB 107 requires stock-based compensation be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation. We have reclassified stock-based compensation from prior periods to correspond to current period presentation within the same operating expense line items as cash compensation paid to employees. Stock-based compensation was $87 million, $58 million and $88 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003. We applied the fair value accounting provisions of SFAS 123(R) for 2005 compared with the application of APB No. 25, including variable accounting treatment on certain awards, for 2004 and 2003. Because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004 and 2003, stock-based compensation for 2005 is not comparable to prior periods. As of December 31, 2005, there was $169 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures of $106 million, related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. 39 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Other operating income was $8 million for 2004 and other operating expense was $3 million for 2003, which includes restructuring-related credits, net, of $9 million in 2004 and amortization of other intangibles of $1 million and $3 million in 2004 and 2003. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring, which we had been unable to sublease due to poor real estate market conditions, was necessary for our future needs. We reduced our restructuring-related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million for 2004. Lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on the consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. These efforts were primarily focused on eliminating French-office positions in managerial, professional, clerical, and technical roles. The number of employees affected totaled 52 and resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in “Other operating expense (income)” on the consolidated statements of operations. Income from Operations Our income from operations was $432 million, $440 million, and $270 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content, an increase in stock-based compensation that is now recorded under SFAS 123(R) fair value accounting, and a payment of $40 million to settle a patent lawsuit. These increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit. The increase in operating income in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributed to increases in net sales and gross profit growth and leveraging operating expenses relative to net sales. Income from operations was negatively affected by year-over-year changes in exchange rates in 2005, and positively affected in 2004 and 2003. Net Interest Expense The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments, including a $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and a €490 million ($580 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2005) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2005. Interest expense was $92 million, $107 million, and $130 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $265 million and $150 million in 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, our total long-term indebtedness was $1.52 billion compared to $1.86 billion at December 31, 2004. In February 2006, we announced plans to redeem €250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 7, 2006, for a cash payment of approximately $305 million (at the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate on January 31, 2006), which includes $1 million of interest. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt and Other.” We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $2 million, $(5) million, and $7 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and consisted primarily of gains (losses) on sales of marketable securities, foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), and other miscellaneous losses, net. 40 Table of Contents Foreign-currency transaction gains (losses) primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS. Since these payments are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable (which is paid annually in February) is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ 90 $ (65 ) $ (140 ) Gain (loss) on sales of Euro-denominated investments, net (2 ) 9 6 Loss on redemption of long-term debt (4) (6 ) (6 ) (24 ) Foreign-currency effect on intercompany balances (2) (47 ) 41 36 Other (3) 7 20 (8 ) Total remeasurements and other $ 42 $ (1 ) $ (130 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” (3) Activity in 2005 and 2004 primarily includes gains associated with the sale of certain equity investments. Activity in 2003 primarily includes a loss from termination of our Euro currency swap. (4) We expect to record a charge of $6 million related to our announced plans to redeem €250 million principal of our 6.875% PEACS, which is expected to close March 6, 2006. Income Taxes We recorded a tax benefit in 2005 of $90 million, representing $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share, as we determined at year end that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. Excluding this $90 million benefit, our effective tax rate would have been significantly higher than the 35% statutory rate, resulting from steps we initiated to establish our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 from the U.S. to international locations which resulted in taxable income and an increase in our effective tax rate. We will initiate similar asset transfers in 2006 to finalize our European headquarters transition, and we expect this will result in an effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006. There is potential for significant volatility of our 2006 effective tax rate due to several factors, including from variability in accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million, compared with $12 million in 2005 and $4 million in 2004. We are not endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a financial reporting basis, instead we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis. We recorded a tax benefit in 2004 of $244 million, representing $0.60 and $0.57 of basic and diluted earnings per share, and a credit to “Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)” of $106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. At December 31, 2005, our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance, are $291 million, which includes $123 million relating to NOLs that are primarily attributed to stock-based 41 Table of Contents compensation, the majority of which begin to expire in 2016, and $18 million relating to capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2006 and thereafter. The remaining portion relates to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The $123 million NOLs primarily attributed to stock-based compensation are presented net of fully-reserved NOL deferred tax assets totaling $493 million. Total gross deferred tax assets related to our NOLs at December 31, 2005 were $616 million (relating to approximately $1.9 billion of NOLs). Net Income Net income was $359 million, $588 million and $35 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. We believe that year-over-year changes in net income are not necessarily predictive of our future net income results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of $95 million and in 2004 we recorded a net income tax benefit of $233 million. Included in these amounts in 2005 and 2004 were tax benefits of $90 million and $244 million resulting from our determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances resulted in net gains in 2005 and net charges in 2004 and 2003 associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and change in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Year Ended December 31, 2003 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 8,563 $ (73 ) $ 8,490 $ 6,645 $ 276 $ 6,921 $ 5,032 $ 232 $ 5,264 Gross profit 2,052 (13 ) 2,039 1,550 52 1,602 1,211 46 1,257 Operating expenses 1,612 (5 ) 1,607 1,130 32 1,162 955 32 987 Income from operations 440 (8 ) 432 420 20 440 256 14 270 Net interest expense and other 52 (6 ) 46 75 9 84 90 11 101 Remeasurements and other (3) 1 41 42 14 (15 ) (1 ) (31 ) (99 ) (130 ) Net income 328 31 359 592 (4 ) 588 131 (96 ) 35 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.77 $ 0.07 $ 0.84 $ 1.40 $ (0.01 ) $ 1.39 $ 0.31 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.08 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (2) Represents the increase (decrease) in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (3) Includes foreign-currency gains (losses) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances, and realized currency-related gains associated with sales of Euro-denominated investments held by a U.S. subsidiary. 42 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by operating activities” for 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 733 $ 566 $ 393 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (204 ) (89 ) (46 ) Free cash flow $ 529 $ 477 $ 347 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (778 ) $ (317 ) $ 236 Net cash used in financing activities $ (193 ) $ (97 ) $ (332 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, which excludes the employer portion of payroll tax expense. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company’s compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 2, 2006 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2006 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $2.14 billion and $2.29 billion, or grow between 13% and 20%, compared with first quarter 2005. • Operating income is expected to be between $70 million and $105 million, or decline between (35%) and (3%), compared with first quarter 2005. This guidance includes $30 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded, and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates. Full Year 2006 Expectations • Net sales are expected to be between $9.85 billion and $10.45 billion, or grow between 16% and 23%, compared with 2005. • Operating income is expected to be between $370 million and $510 million, or between (14%) decline and 18% growth, compared with 2005. This guidance includes $135 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no changes to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A. of Part 1, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 44 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2005 (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2005 Money market funds $ 587 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 587 $ 587 Weighted average interest rate 3.41 % — — — — — 3.41 % Certificates of deposit 15 5 3 4 — — 27 29 Weighted average interest rate 3.67 % 2.90 % 3.06 % 3.03 % — — 3.37 % Corporate debt securities 200 53 33 69 33 — 388 402 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.00 % 3.99 % 4.60 % 4.60 % — 4.14 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 211 35 79 43 73 — 441 439 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.98 % 4.76 % 4.94 % 4.58 % — 4.39 % Asset backed securities 131 97 33 5 10 — 276 276 Weighted average interest rate 3.89 % 4.94 % 4.10 % 5.02 % 4.95 % — 4.34 % Other securities 3 33 47 35 18 — 136 165 Weighted average interest rate 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.83 % 2.95 % 3.01 % — 2.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,147 $ 223 $ 195 $ 156 $ 134 $ — $ 1,855 $ 1,898 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2004 (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2004 Money market funds $ 102 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 102 $ 103 Weighted average interest rate 2.18 % — — — — — 2.18 % Certificates of deposit 496 — — — — — 496 497 Weighted average interest rate 2.52 % — — — — — 2.52 % Corporate debt securities 240 4 3 8 13 — 268 275 Weighted average interest rate 2.25 % 3.45 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % — 2.51 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 142 141 46 43 19 — 391 388 Weighted average interest rate 2.33 % 3.32 % 3.29 % 3.00 % 3.00 % — 2.91 % Asset backed securities — 61 8 — — — 69 70 Weighted average interest rate — 4.38 % 3.10 % — — — 4.24 % Other securities 26 — — — — 26 27 Weighted average interest rate 2.24 % — — — — — 2.24 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,006 $ 206 $ 57 $ 51 $ 32 $ — $ 1,352 $ 1,360 At December 31, 2005, we had long-term debt of $1.52 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 45 Table of Contents Based upon quoted market prices at prevailing exchange rates, the fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was €495 million or $586 million (outstanding principal of €490 million) and €691 million or $936 million (outstanding principal of €690 million) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $868 million and $907 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2005, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2005, International segment revenues declined $78 million and our operating results declined $7 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2005 of $905 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $45 million, $91 million, and $181 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2005 of €490 million ($580 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2005). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $97 million as of December 31, 2005. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS’ principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $29 million, $58 million, and $116 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2006, we would incur $2 million, $4 million, and $8 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2005, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly-traded and private companies) was $14 million, including $6 million classified as “Marketable securities,” and $8 million classified as “Other assets.” We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company-specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2005 of $44 million (recorded basis of $7 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $7 million, $13 million, and $22 million. 46 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:50.603417

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our websites include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third parties. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third parties. We also offer services such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co-branded credit cards, web services, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally requires us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. Because we have deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards, the free cash flow impact from income taxes paid is currently less than our income tax provision. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they better align 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 23 Table of Contents the interests of our shareholders and employees. Restricted stock units result in charges to our consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date recorded on an accelerated basis over the underlying service periods, net of estimated cancellations. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 436 million and 438 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. These totals include all stock awards outstanding, without regard for estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in-the-money and out-of-the-money stock options. In 2006, we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our customer experience variable costs per unit and work to leverage our customer experience fixed costs. Our customer experience variable costs include product costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our customer experience fixed costs include the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 13, 14, and 16 for 2006, 2005, and 2004. Inventory turnover has declined over the last several years, primarily due to changes in product mix and our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third-party sales, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 53, 54, and 53 for 2006, 2005 and 2004. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third-party sales, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and category expansion as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 24 Table of Contents currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made 25 Table of Contents pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime, online DVD rentals, and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from third-party sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the third-party seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment-related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment-related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by third parties, the third-party maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Internal-Use Software Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income. Our international operations are financed, in part, by the U.S. parent company. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 26 Table of Contents based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees, the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures. If employees leave early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stock-based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax 27 Table of Contents position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007. We estimate the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 702 $ 733 $ 566 Investing activities (333 ) (778 ) (317 ) Financing activities (400 ) (193 ) (97 ) Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $486 million for 2006, compared to $529 million and $477 million for 2005 and 2004. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows. Free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a $40 million patent litigation settlement. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and timing of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $623 million and $905 million at the end of 2006 and 2005, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was presented in operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows, which is effectively a reclassification between operating and financing cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $102 million, $7 million, and $8 million for December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, with the amounts for 2006 and 2005 treated as financing cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities was $702 million, $733 million, and $566 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the $40 million patent litigation settlement in 2005. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from third-party sellers, and from non-retail activities such as through our co-branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98-1 that are reflected in cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, third-party sellers and non-retail activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash used in investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash flows from acquisitions, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website 28 Table of Contents development costs. Cash used in investing activities was $333 million, $778 million, and $317 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $216 million, $204 million and $89 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investment in development of new features and product offerings on our websites, as well as investments in fulfillment-related assets and technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures included $108 million, $79 million and $44 million for internal-use software and website development during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We also made payments, net of acquired cash, of $32 million, $24 million, and $71 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004 to purchase certain comapnies. Cash used in financing activities was $400 million, $193 million, and $97 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long-term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased $252 million of our common stock under a $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2006. Repayments on long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $383 million, $270 million, and $157 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Repayments on long-term debt include €250 million and €200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. Additionally, we repaid $154 million to redeem a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2004. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt.” If all of our capital leases were classified as operating leases, the detriment to cash flows from operating activities would have been $21 million, $2 million, and $4 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $35 million, $59 million, and $60 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $102 million and $7 million in 2006 and 2005, in accordance with adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will continue to decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock-based awards. In 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of $187 million and $95 million, and in 2004 we recorded a net tax benefit of $233 million. A majority of this provision and benefit is non-cash. We have net operating losses that are classified as deferred tax assets and are being utilized to reduce our taxable income to nominal levels. As such, cash taxes paid were $15 million, $12 million, and $4 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to an aggregate of $500 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS. Additionally, in August 2006 our Board of Directors authorized a 24-month program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock, of which $248 million remains authorized for repurchase at December 31, 2006. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated interest payable are classified as “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 13, 14, and 16 for 2006, 2005, and 2004. We expect some variability 29 Table of Contents in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, our mix of third-party sales, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers, among other factors. The decline in inventory turnover is primarily attributed to our emphasis on category expansion and maintaining wide selection of in-stock inventory, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal and other (1) $ 17 $ — $ 930 $ 317 $ — $ — $ 1,264 Debt interest (1) 66 66 44 22 — — 198 Capital leases, including interest 35 7 5 4 4 5 60 Operating leases 129 113 91 72 50 184 639 Other commitments 20 5 8 6 1 19 59 Purchase obligations (2) 420 11 12 9 10 5 467 Total commitments $ 687 $ 202 $ 1,090 $ 430 $ 65 $ 213 $ 2,687 (1) At December 31, 2006, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.3201. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $80 million as of December 31, 2006. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Consists of legally-binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non-inventory commitments. Pledged Securities We are required to support certain letters of credit, debt, and real estate leases by pledging or otherwise restricting cash and marketable securities. We classify marketable securities, where a use restriction exists for a period of twelve months or longer, as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2006 consisted of $50 million in “Marketable securities” and $86 million in “Other assets”. The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases with fluctuations in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock) and based on our credit-rating. Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters ofCredit (1) Debt (2) Real EstateLeases (3) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 59 $ 14 $ 18 $ 91 Net change in collateral pledged 1 42 2 45 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 60 $ 56 $ 20 $ 136 (1) Pursuant to available standby and trade letter-of-credit facilities totaling $233 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies.” (2) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (3) At December 31, 2006, our market capitalization was $16.3 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion and decrease by $5 million if our market capitalization exceeds $18 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash 30 Table of Contents needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 5,869 $ 4,711 $ 3,847 International 4,842 3,779 3,074 Consolidated $ 10,711 $ 8,490 $ 6,921 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 25 % 22 % 18 % International 28 23 53 Consolidated 26 23 31 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 24 % 22 % 18 % International 28 25 40 Consolidated 26 24 26 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 55 % 56 % International 45 45 44 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 26% in 2006, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $24 million for 2006. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rate changes, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America revenue growth rate was 25% in 2006. This revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock product availability, and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories. 31 Table of Contents The International revenue growth rate was 28% in 2006. This revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, shift in mix of product sales from media to electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock product availability, and increased selection of product offerings in our existing categories. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $18 million in 2006. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See “Supplemental Information” below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 1,525 $ 1,267 $ 1,024 International 931 772 578 Consolidated $ 2,456 $ 2,039 $ 1,602 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 20 % 24 % 18 % International 21 33 48 Consolidated 20 27 27 Gross Margin: North America 26.0 % 26.9 % 26.6 % International 19.2 20.4 18.8 Consolidated 22.9 24.0 23.1 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2006, compared to 2005 and 2004, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by third-party sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We offer promotions, such as free membership trials for Amazon Prime, and we expect to continue to offer these promotions in the future. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by third-party sellers on our websites represented 28%, 28%, and 26% of unit sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by a third party. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix. Revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from third-party sellers, resulting in lower gross margins. Sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media, further reducing gross margins. Additionally, we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. 32 Table of Contents North America segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 30 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increases in revenue by third-party sellers, increases in amounts earned from our co-branded credit card agreement, improvements in terms with suppliers, and increases in amounts earned from service agreements, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. International segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix. Sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media, resulting in lower gross margins. International segment gross margins in 2005 improved by 162 basis points compared to 2004 resulting primarily from increasing revenue from third-party sellers and increases in discounts we receive from our product suppliers, offset partially by changes in mix of product sales and our efforts to continue reducing prices for customers, including from our free shipping offers. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 567 $ 511 $ 420 Outbound shipping costs (884 ) (750 ) (617 ) Net shipping cost $ (317 ) $ (239 ) $ (197 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 11 % 22 % 13 % Outbound shipping costs 18 22 21 Net shipping cost 32 22 44 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 5.3 % 6.0 % 6.1 % Outbound shipping costs (8.3 ) (8.8 ) (8.9 ) Net shipping cost (3.0 )% (2.8 )% (2.8 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership program. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. Our net shipping cost results primarily from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 33 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 3,582 $ 3,046 $ 2,589 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,024 1,443 1,128 Other (1) 263 222 130 Total North America $ 5,869 $ 4,711 $ 3,847 International Media $ 3,485 $ 2,885 $ 2,513 Electronics and other general merchandise 1,337 886 559 Other (1) 20 8 2 Total International $ 4,842 $ 3,779 $ 3,074 Consolidated Media $ 7,067 $ 5,931 $ 5,102 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,361 2,329 1,687 Other (1) 283 230 132 Total consolidated $ 10,711 $ 8,490 $ 6,921 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 18 % 18 % 14 % Electronics and other general merchandise 40 28 28 Other 18 71 18 Total North America 25 22 18 International Media 21 % 15 % 41 % Electronics and other general merchandise 51 59 149 Other 151 234 98 Total International 28 23 53 Consolidated Media 19 % 16 % 26 % Electronics and other general merchandise 44 38 53 Other 23 74 19 Total consolidated 26 23 32 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 21 % 17 % 29 % Electronics and other general merchandise 49 62 126 Other 147 247 79 Total International 28 25 40 Consolidated Media 19 % 17 % 20 % Electronics and other general merchandise 43 39 48 Other 23 74 19 Total consolidated 26 24 26 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 66 % 70 % 74 % Electronics and other general merchandise 31 27 24 Other 3 3 2 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, our co-branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 34 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 $ 601 $ (10 ) $ 591 Marketing 263 (4 ) 259 198 (6 ) 192 162 (4 ) 158 Technology and content 662 (54 ) 608 451 (45 ) 406 283 (32 ) 251 General and administrative 195 (19 ) 176 166 (20 ) 146 124 (12 ) 112 Other operating expense 10 — 10 47 — 47 (8 ) — (8 ) Total operating expenses $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 $ 1,162 $ (58 ) $ 1,104 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 26 % 25 % 24 % 23 % 21 % 24 % Marketing 32 34 22 22 27 29 Technology and content 47 50 59 62 10 21 General and administrative 18 21 34 30 20 27 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.7 % 8.5 % 8.8 % 8.6 % 8.7 % 8.5 % Marketing 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 6.2 5.7 5.3 4.8 4.1 3.6 General and administrative 1.8 1.6 1.9 1.7 1.8 1.6 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2006 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain third-party seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with third-party seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our third-party sales have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2006 and 2005 through gains in efficiencies as well as increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and in-stock levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e-mail campaigns, and other initiatives. 35 Table of Contents Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute terms in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content In 2005 and 2006, we added computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, and digital initiatives, as well as expansion of new and existing product categories. Additionally, we increased spending on technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. We believe these initiatives are important to our long-term success. See “Overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff. For the years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004, we capitalized $123 million, $90 million, and $44 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $86 million, $50 million, and $30 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional fees. In 2005, we recorded a $12 million credit for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us. Stock-Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based awards under the intrinsic value method, which followed the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at their estimated fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock, and for stock options to the extent option exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant. Also, to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer, other modifications, or performance criteria, such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment. To the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses. As of January 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our 36 Table of Contents common stock, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method under SFAS No. 123(R). The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. Additionally, because we implemented SFAS No. 123(R), we no longer have employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Stock-based compensation was $101 million, $87 million and $58 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. We applied the fair value accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) for 2006 and 2005 compared with the application of APB Opinion No. 25, including variable accounting treatment on certain awards, for 2004. Because of the application of different methods of accounting as well as the effects of variable accounting treatment in 2004, stock-based compensation for 2006 and 2005 is not comparable to prior periods. As of December 31, 2006, there was $217 million of net unrecognized compensation cost, related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. Other Operating Expense (Income) Other operating expense was $10 million in 2006, primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles. Other operating expense was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Other operating income was $8 million for 2004, which includes net restructuring-related credits of $9 million and amortization of other intangibles of $1 million. During 2004, we determined that certain of the office space previously vacated as part of our 2001 restructuring was necessary for our future needs. We reduced our restructuring-related liability resulting in a gain of $13 million for 2004. Lease payments for this office space are expensed over the lease period and classified to the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. In 2004, we streamlined our organizational structure in France to reduce our operating costs. This reduction resulted in severance costs of $4 million classified in “Other operating expense (income)” on our consolidated statements of operations. Income from Operations Income from operations was $389 million, $432 million, and $440 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content, an increase in stock-based compensation that is now recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) fair value accounting, and a payment of $40 million to settle a patent lawsuit. These increased expenditures were partially offset by higher net sales and gross profit. Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments, including a $900 million principal balance of our 4.75% U.S. Convertible Subordinated Notes and a 37 Table of Contents €240 million ($317 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2006. Interest expense was $78 million, $92 million, and $107 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $300 million, $265 million, and $150 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004. At December 31, 2006, our total long-term indebtedness was $1.25 billion compared to $1.48 billion at December 31, 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt.” Our interest income was $59 million, $44 million, and $28 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $(4) million, $2 million, and $(5) million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, foreign-currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous losses. Foreign-currency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS, as well as foreign-currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments. Since interest payments on our 6.875% PEACS are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ (37 ) $ 90 $ (65 ) Loss on redemption of long-term debt (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on intercompany balances (2) 50 (47 ) 41 Other 4 5 29 Total remeasurements and other $ 11 $ 42 $ (1 ) (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currency.” Income Taxes We recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $187 million, $95 million, and $(233) million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% statutory rate resulting from establishing our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. 38 Table of Contents Included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of $90 million, resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable. This tax benefit represented $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share. We recorded a tax benefit of $244 million in 2004, representing $0.60 and $0.57 of basic and diluted earnings per share, and a credit to stockholders’ equity of $106 million as we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35% or less. However, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Year Ended December 31, 2004 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 $ 8,563 $ (73 ) $ 8,490 $ 6,645 $ 276 $ 6,921 Gross profit 2,455 1 2,456 2,052 (13 ) 2,039 1,550 52 1,602 Operating expenses 2,064 3 2,067 1,612 (5 ) 1,607 1,130 32 1,162 Income from operations 391 (2 ) 389 440 (8 ) 432 420 20 440 Net interest expense and other (3) 17 6 23 52 (6 ) 46 75 9 84 Remeasurements and other income (expense) (4) (2 ) 13 11 1 41 42 14 (15 ) (1 ) Net income 188 2 190 328 31 359 592 (4 ) 588 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.44 $ 0.01 $ 0.45 $ 0.77 $ 0.07 $ 0.84 $ 1.40 $ (0.01 ) $ 1.39 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments. (4) Includes foreign-currency gains and losses on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed 39 Table of Contents with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by operating activities” for 2006, 2005, and 2004 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 702 $ 733 $ 566 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (216 ) (204 ) (89 ) Free cash flow $ 486 $ 529 $ 477 Net cash used in investing activities $ (333 ) $ (778 ) $ (317 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (400 ) $ (193 ) $ (97 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment”, “Technology and content”, “Marketing”, and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the Company’s compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. 40 Table of Contents Guidance The Company provided guidance on February 1, 2007 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2007 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $2.85 billion and $3.00 billion, or to grow between 25% and 32% compared with first quarter 2006. • Operating income is expected to be between $82 million and $122 million, or between (22%) decline and 16% growth, compared with first quarter 2006. This guidance includes $38 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. Full Year 2007 Expectations • Net sales are expected to be between $13.00 billion and $13.70 billion, or to grow between 21% and 28% compared with 2006. • Operating income is expected to be between $355 million and $505 million, or between (9%) decline and 30% growth, compared with 2006. This guidance includes $165 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 41 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2006 (in millions, except percentages): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2006 Money market funds $ 763 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 763 $ 763 Weighted average interest rate 3.92 % — — — — — 3.92 % Certificates of deposit 50 — — — — — 50 50 Weighted average interest rate 5.25 % — — — — — 5.25 % Corporate debt securities 266 45 40 29 39 — 419 419 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.43 % 5.23 % 5.04 % 4.83 % — 5.35 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 53 32 20 39 27 37 208 207 Weighted average interest rate 5.24 % 4.77 % 4.88 % 4.85 % 4.95 % 5.46 % 5.06 % Asset backed securities 238 32 40 29 9 — 348 347 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.28 % 5.19 % 5.91 % — 5.43 % Other securities 21 30 23 17 18 — 109 108 Weighted average interest rate 3.74 % 3.93 % 3.92 % 3.86 % 3.87 % — 3.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,391 $ 139 $ 123 $ 114 $ 93 $ 37 $ 1,897 $ 1,894 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2005 (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2005 Money market funds $ 587 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 587 $ 587 Weighted average interest rate 3.41 % — — — — — 3.41 % Certificates of deposit 15 5 3 4 — — 27 29 Weighted average interest rate 3.67 % 2.90 % 3.06 % 3.03 % — — 3.37 % Corporate debt securities 200 53 33 69 33 — 388 402 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.00 % 3.99 % 4.60 % 4.60 % — 4.14 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 211 35 79 43 73 — 441 439 Weighted average interest rate 3.97 % 4.98 % 4.76 % 4.94 % 4.58 % — 4.39 % Asset backed securities 131 97 33 5 10 — 276 275 Weighted average interest rate 3.89 % 4.94 % 4.10 % 5.02 % 4.95 % — 4.34 % Other securities 3 33 47 35 18 136 166 Weighted average interest rate 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.83 % 2.95 % 3.01 % — 2.87 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,147 $ 223 $ 195 $ 156 $ 134 $ — $ 1,855 $ 1,898 At December 31, 2006, we had long-term debt of $1.25 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (outstanding principal of $900 million) was $883 million and $868 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. 42 Table of Contents The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $320 million at December 31, 2006 (outstanding principal of €240 million), and $586 million at December 31, 2005 (outstanding principal of €490 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2006, net sales from our International segment (consisting of www.amazon.co.uk, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.jp, and www.joyo.com) accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from these websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2006, International segment revenues increased $18 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2006 of $623 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $30 million, $60 million, and $125 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2006 of $386 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $20 million, $40 million, and $80 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2006 of €240 million ($317 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2006). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $80 million as of December 31, 2006. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS’ principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $15 million, $30 million, and $65 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2006, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $4 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2006, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly-traded and private companies) was $27 million, including $7 million classified as “Marketable securities,” and $19 million classified as “Other assets.” We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company-specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2006 of $59 million (recorded basis of $11 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $20 million, and $30 million. 43 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:43.231186
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” which, along with the previous discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations. Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by marketplace sellers. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, co-branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In managing shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in-the-money 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 22 Table of Contents and out-of-the-money stock options. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 435 million and 436 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. These amounts exclude 14 million shares issuable upon conversion of our long-term debt. In 2007, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to publisher and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 13, 13, and 14 for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 57, 53, and 54 for 2007, 2006 and 2005. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We will continue to invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved customer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the customer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. Amazon Web Services provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of annualized cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 23 Table of Contents higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the 24 Table of Contents carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. For our products with multiple elements, where a standalone value for each element cannot be established, we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through Amazon Enterprise Solutions are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectibility is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment-related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment-related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by other sellers, the seller maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Internal-Use Software and Website Development Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over the estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Currency Effect on Intercompany Balances Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions are included in net income. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined 25 Table of Contents based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Since we primarily issue restricted stock units to our employees, the complexity of valuation issues for stock compensation is greatly reduced. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a level of complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards that related to differences in stock-based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. 26 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB may delay a portion of this standard. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No. 141 (R) or SFAS No. 160. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,405 $ 702 $ 733 Investing activities 42 (333 ) (778 ) Financing activities 50 (400 ) (193 ) Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.18 billion for 2007, compared to $486 million and $529 million for 2006 and 2005. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. The decrease in free cash flow in 2006 was primarily driven by our increased expenditure in technology and content and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation deductions now classified as financing cash flows. Free cash flow for 2005 included the effect of our payment of a $40 million patent litigation settlement. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $3.1 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $1.2 billion, $623 million, and 27 Table of Contents $905 million at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion, $702 million, and $733 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non-retail activities such as our co-branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98-1 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions and intellectual property rights, and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $42 million, $(333) million, and $(778) million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $224 million, $216 million and $204 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment-related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. Capital expenditures included $108 million, $108 million and $79 million for internal-use software and website development during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We made payments for the acquisition of certain companies and intellectual property rights, resulting in cash payments, net of acquired cash, of $75 million, $32 million, and $24 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005 attributable to cash provided by investing activities. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $50 million, $(400) million, and $(193) million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long-term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased 6 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007, and 8 million shares of common stock for $252 million in 2006, under a $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2006. Repayments on long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $74 million, $383 million, and $270 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Repayments on long-term debt include €250 million and €200 million of our 6.875% PEACS for $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt.” Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions be presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $257 million, $102 million and $7 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $91 million, $35 million, and $59 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock-based awards. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded net tax provisions of $184 million, $187 million, and $95 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid were $24 million, $15 million, and $12 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open 28 Table of Contents market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (“4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes”) and 6.875% PEACS. The outstanding principal of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes as of this authorization was $899 million, and the outstanding principal amount of our 6.875% PEACS was €240 million. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24-month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated interest payable are classified as “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 13, 13, and 14 for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal (1) $ 17 $ 932 $ 350 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,299 Debt interest (1) 69 46 24 — — — 139 Capital leases, including interest 32 29 23 6 6 5 101 Operating leases 132 107 89 69 52 201 650 Other commitments (2)(3) 60 64 80 60 43 579 886 Purchase obligations (4) 485 — — — — — 485 Total commitments $ 795 $ 1,178 $ 566 $ 135 $ 101 $ 785 $ 3,560 (1) At December 31, 2007, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.459. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $114 million as of December 31, 2007. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemptions of the 6.875% PEACS and 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent, operating expenses, and tenant improvements associated with approximately 800,000 square feet of corporate office space in Seattle, Washington. We also have the right to occupy up to an additional approximately 800,000 square feet subject to a termination fee, estimated to be up to approximately $40 million, if we do not elect to occupy this additional space. The amount of space available and our financial and other obligations under the lease agreements are affected by various factors, including government approvals and permits, interest rates, development costs and other expenses and our exercise of certain rights under the lease agreements. See 29 Table of Contents Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies—Commitments.” (3) Includes commitments to acquire intellectual property and unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48, but excludes $105 million of such unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12—Income Taxes.” (4) Consists of legally-binding commitments to purchase inventory and significant non-inventory commitments. In January 2008 we closed or entered into agreements, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, to acquire or invest in certain companies. These acquisitions and investments result in aggregate cash payments of approximately $400 million, net of cash acquired. Pledged Securities We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. We classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2007 consisted of $14 million in “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Marketable securities,” and $197 million in “Other assets.” The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock). Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters of Creditand Guarantees Debt (1) Real EstateLeases (2) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 60 $ 56 $ 20 $ 136 Net change in collateral pledged 78 4 (7 ) 75 Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 138 $ 60 $ 13 $ 211 (1) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (2) At December 31, 2006, our market capitalization was $38.6 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 8,095 $ 5,869 $ 4,711 International 6,740 4,842 3,779 Consolidated $ 14,835 $ 10,711 $ 8,490 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 38 % 25 % 22 % International 39 28 23 Consolidated 39 26 23 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 38 % 24 % 22 % International 31 28 25 Consolidated 35 26 24 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 55 % 55 % International 45 45 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 39% in 2007, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $399 million for 2007. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America revenue growth rate was 38% in 2007. This revenue growth primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. The International revenue growth rate was 39% in 2007. This revenue growth reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $390 million in 2007. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See “Supplemental Information” below. 31 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 2,031 $ 1,525 $ 1,267 International 1,322 931 772 Consolidated $ 3,353 $ 2,456 $ 2,039 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 33 % 20 % 24 % International 42 21 33 Consolidated 37 20 27 Gross Margin: North America 25.1 % 26.0 % 26.9 % International 19.6 19.2 20.4 Consolidated 22.6 22.9 24.0 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2007, compared to 2006 and 2005, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by marketplace sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 28% of unit sales in 2007, 2006, and 2005. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller . Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics. North America segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 92 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix, as revenue in our retail business grew faster than revenue from marketplace sellers. In addition, sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media and we continued our efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. International segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by marketplace sellers, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics. International segment gross margins in 2006 decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2005 resulting primarily from changes in our revenue mix as sales from electronics and other general merchandise grew faster than sales from media. 32 Table of Contents Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 740 $ 567 $ 511 Outbound shipping costs (1,174 ) (884 ) (750 ) Net shipping cost $ (434 ) $ (317 ) $ (239 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 31 % 11 % 22 % Outbound shipping costs 33 18 22 Net shipping cost 37 32 22 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 5.0 % 5.3 % 6.0 % Outbound shipping costs (7.9 ) (8.3 ) (8.8 ) Net shipping cost (2.9 )% (3.0 )% (2.8 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 33 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 4,630 $ 3,582 $ 3,046 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,139 2,024 1,443 Other (1) 326 263 222 Total North America $ 8,095 $ 5,869 $ 4,711 International Media $ 4,612 $ 3,485 $ 2,885 Electronics and other general merchandise 2,071 1,337 886 Other (1) 57 20 8 Total International $ 6,740 $ 4,842 $ 3,779 Consolidated Media $ 9,242 $ 7,067 $ 5,931 Electronics and other general merchandise 5,210 3,361 2,329 Other (1) 383 283 230 Total consolidated $ 14,835 $ 10,711 $ 8,490 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 29 % 18 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 40 28 Other 24 18 71 Total North America 38 25 22 International Media 32 % 21 % 15 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 51 59 Other 186 151 234 Total International 39 28 23 Consolidated Media 31 % 19 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 44 38 Other 35 23 74 Total consolidated 39 26 23 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 25 % 21 % 17 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 49 62 Other 165 147 247 Total International 31 28 25 Consolidated Media 27 % 19 % 17 % Electronics and other general merchandise 51 43 39 Other 34 23 74 Total consolidated 35 26 24 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 62 % 66 % 70 % Electronics and other general merchandise 35 31 27 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as Amazon Enterprise Solutions, our co-branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional services. 34 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 Year ended December 31, 2005 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 $ 745 $ (16 ) $ 729 Marketing 344 (8 ) 336 263 (4 ) 259 198 (6 ) 192 Technology and content 818 (103 ) 715 662 (54 ) 608 451 (45 ) 406 General and administrative 235 (35 ) 200 195 (19 ) 176 166 (20 ) 146 Other operating expense 9 — 9 10 — 10 47 — 47 Total operating expenses $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 $ 1,607 $ (87 ) $ 1,520 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 38 % 37 % 26 % 25 % 24 % 23 % Marketing 31 30 32 34 22 22 Technology and content 23 17 47 50 59 62 General and administrative 20 13 18 21 34 30 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.7 % 8.5 % 8.8 % 8.6 % Marketing 2.3 2.3 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 5.5 4.8 6.2 5.7 5.3 4.8 General and administrative 1.6 1.3 1.8 1.6 1.9 1.7 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2007 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain marketplace seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2007, 2006, and 2005 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion is designed to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e-mail campaigns, and other initiatives. 35 Table of Contents Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, and other variable marketing initiatives. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We continue to invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, and digital initiatives, as well as expansion of new and existing product categories. We are also investing in technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See “Overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. The growth rate of our technology and content spending decreased in 2007 compared to the prior year. We intend to continue investing in areas of technology and content as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2007, 2006, and 2005, we capitalized $129 million, $123 million, and $90 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $116 million, $86 million, and $50 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional fees. Stock-Based Compensation As of January 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a cumulative benefit from accounting change of $26 million in 2005, which reflects the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted. Stock-based compensation was $185 million, $101 million and $87 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. The increase in stock-based compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees. 36 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net, was $9 million and $10 million during 2007 and 2006, primarily attributable to amortization of other intangibles. Other operating expense, net, was $47 million in 2005, primarily attributable to our settlement of a patent lawsuit for $40 million, as well as amortization of other intangibles of $5 million. Income from Operations Income from operations was $655 million, $389 million, and $432 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. The increase in 2007 from 2006 is primarily a result of the increased growth rate of our revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 is primarily a result of an increase in spending for technology and content. Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments, including a $899 million principal balance of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and a €240 million ($350 million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2007) principal balance of our 6.875% PEACS at December 31, 2007. Interest expense was $77 million, $78 million, and $92 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, with declines primarily relating to principal repayments of $300 million and $265 million in 2006 and 2005. Our total long-term indebtedness was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Long-Term Debt.” Our interest income was $90 million, $59 million, and $44 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, was $(1) million, $(4) million, and $2 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, and consisted primarily of gains and losses on sales of marketable securities, foreign-currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous losses. Foreign-currency transaction gains and losses primarily relate to the interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS, as well as foreign-currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments. Since interest payments on our 6.875% PEACS are settled in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro between reporting dates and payment. Remeasurements and Other Remeasurements and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS $ (33 ) $ (37 ) $ 90 Loss on redemption of long-term debt — (6 ) (6 ) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on intercompany balances 32 50 (47 ) Other (6 ) 4 5 Total remeasurements and other $ (7 ) $ 11 $ 42 (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Remeasurements and other” on our consolidated statements of operations. 37 Table of Contents (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currency.” Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $184 million, $187 million, and $95 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The effective tax rate in 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expect will benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. Included in the 2005 provision and reducing the impact of the international restructure is a tax benefit of $90 million, resulting from certain of our deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not realizable. This tax benefit represented $0.22 and $0.21 of basic and diluted earnings per share. We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30%. However, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, and business acquisitions and investments. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non-cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 $ 8,563 $ (73 ) $ 8,490 Gross profit 3,274 79 3,353 2,455 1 2,456 2,052 (13 ) 2,039 Operating expenses 2,648 50 2,698 2,064 3 2,067 1,612 (5 ) 1,607 Income from operations 626 29 655 391 (2 ) 389 440 (8 ) 432 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 11 1 12 (17 ) (6 ) (23 ) (52 ) 6 (46 ) Remeasurements and other income (expense) (4) (6 ) (1 ) (7 ) (2 ) 13 11 1 41 42 Net income 456 20 476 188 2 190 328 31 359 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances.

(4) Includes foreign-currency gains and losses on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by operating activities” for 2007, 2006, and 2005 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,405 $ 702 $ 733 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (224 ) (216 ) (204 ) Free cash flow $ 1,181 $ 486 $ 529 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 42 $ (333 ) $ (778 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 50 $ (400 ) $ (193 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in 39 Table of Contents the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. Guidance The Company provided guidance on January 30, 2008 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2008 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion, or to grow between 31% and 38% compared with first quarter 2007. • Operating income is expected to be between $155 million and $200 million, or to grow between 7% and 38% compared with first quarter 2007. This guidance includes $55 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional acquired intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. Full Year 2008 Expectations • Net sales are expected to be between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, or to grow between 26% and 33% compared with 2007. • Operating income is expected to be between $785 million and $985 million, or to grow between 20% and 50% compared with 2007. This guidance includes $240 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional acquired intangible assets are recorded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market mutual funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2007 (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2007 Money market funds $ 1,408 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,408 $ 1,408 Weighted average interest rate 4.42 % — — — — — 4.42 % Certificates of deposit — — — — — — — — Weighted average interest rate — — — — — — — Corporate debt securities 6 16 26 49 18 — 115 116 Weighted average interest rate 5.11 % 4.65 % 4.78 % 4.59 % 4.85 % — 4.71 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 120 49 49 33 46 — 297 301 Weighted average interest rate 4.26 % 3.20 % 3.69 % 3.72 % 3.46 % — 3.81 % Asset backed securities 10 31 30 28 1 1 101 101 Weighted average interest rate 5.17 % 4.80 % 4.74 % 4.99 % 4.62 % 4.65 % 4.87 % Foreign government and agency securities 274 30 18 26 9 — 357 357 Weighted average interest rate 4.28 % 3.49 % 3.71 % 3.89 % 3.83 % — 4.15 % Other securities — 4 — — — — 4 4 Weighted average interest rate — 4.55 % — — — — 4.55 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,818 $ 130 $ 123 $ 136 $ 74 $ 1 $ 2,282 $ 2,287 The following table provides information about our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2006 (in millions, except percentages): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2006 Money market funds $ 763 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 763 $ 763 Weighted average interest rate 3.92 % — — — — — 3.92 % Certificates of deposit 50 — — — — — 50 50 Weighted average interest rate 5.25 % — — — — — 5.25 % Corporate debt securities 266 45 40 29 39 — 419 419 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.43 % 5.23 % 5.04 % 4.83 % — 5.35 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 53 32 20 39 27 37 208 207 Weighted average interest rate 5.24 % 4.77 % 4.88 % 4.85 % 4.95 % 5.46 % 5.06 % Asset backed securities 238 32 40 29 9 — 348 347 Weighted average interest rate 5.47 % 5.42 % 5.28 % 5.19 % 5.91 % — 5.43 % Foreign government and agency securities 21 28 21 17 18 — 105 104 Weighted average interest rate 3.74 % 3.83 % 3.83 % 3.86 % 3.87 % — 3.82 % Other securities — 2 2 — — — 4 4 Weighted average interest rate — 5.08 % 5.12 % — — — 5.10 % Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 1,391 $ 139 $ 123 $ 114 $ 93 $ 37 $ 1,897 $ 1,894 At December 31, 2007, we had long-term debt of $1.3 billion primarily associated with our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2009 and 2010. The fair value of our long-term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 41 Table of Contents Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of $899 million) and $883 million (outstanding principal of $900 million) at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $358 million at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of €240 million), and $320 million at December 31, 2006 (outstanding principal of €240 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2007, net sales from our International segment accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2007, International segment revenues increased $390 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2007 of $1.2 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $60 million, $120 million, and $240 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2007 of $250 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $15 million, $25 million, and $50 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2007 of €240 million ($350 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2007). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $114 million as of December 31, 2007. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS’ principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $20 million, $35 million, and $70 million, recorded to “Remeasurements and other.” Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20% in 2007, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2007, our recorded basis in equity securities (including both publicly-traded and private companies) was $29 million, including $12 million classified as “Marketable securities,” and $17 million classified as “Other assets.” We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. The fair values of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the stock market in general, company-specific circumstances, and changes in general economic conditions. Based on the fair value of the publicly-traded equity securities we held at December 31, 2007 of $55 million (recorded basis of $12 million), an assumed 15%, 30%, and 50% adverse change to market prices of these securities would result in a corresponding decline in total fair value of approximately $10 million, $15 million, and $25 million. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:45.197544
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, co-branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers, such as online advertising. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards and in-the-money and out-of-the-money stock options. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 446 million 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 20 Table of Contents and 435 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. These amounts exclude shares issuable upon conversion of our long-term debt. In 2008 and 2007, we repurchased 2.2 million shares and 6.3 million shares of our common stock under repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 12, 13, and 13 for 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 62, 57, and 53 for 2008, 2007 and 2006. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. We are investing in Amazon Web Services, which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business. A continuing challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing-twelve-month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the period. 21 Table of Contents economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and delivery of any undelivered item is probable. We evaluate the criteria of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of the two, we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail items sold to customers are made pursuant to sales contracts that generally provide for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales taxes. Amounts paid in advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime and 22 Table of Contents other membership programs, are deferred and recognized as revenue over the subscription term. For our products with multiple elements, where a standalone value for each element cannot be established, we recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life of the product. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount offers and inducement offers are classified as an offsetting amount in “Net sales.” Commissions and per-unit fees received from sellers and similar amounts earned through other seller sites are recognized when the item is sold by the seller and our collectability is reasonably assured. When we are responsible for fulfillment-related services, commissions are recognized when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer. We record an allowance for estimated refunds on such commissions using historical experience. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. Based on this evaluation, we adjust the carrying amount of our inventories to lower of cost or market value. We provide fulfillment-related services in connection with certain of our agreements. In those arrangements, as well as other product sales by other sellers, the seller maintains ownership of the related products. As such, these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. We also have equity-method investments in private companies where we can exercise significant influence over, but not control, the entity. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment. Factors considered include, if applicable, quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; other publicly available information; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; or other conditions that may affect the value of our investments. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on projected category expansion, pricing expectations, market segment penetration and general economic conditions. Additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and 23 Table of Contents developing revenue models. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated and compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer-term trend. Internal-Use Software and Website Development Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and processes supporting our business. As required by Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,” we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software and amortize these costs over its estimated useful life of two years. Costs incurred related to design or maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than a straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The majority of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards attributable to differences in stock-based compensation between the financial statements and our tax returns. 24 Table of Contents Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long-term deferred tax assets on a pro-rata basis. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies) accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, SFAS No. 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. See “Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies” and “Note 2—Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities” for further discussion. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 157-2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. FSP 157-2 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. Those assets and liabilities measured at fair value under SFAS No. 157 in Q1 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with FSP 157-2, we will measure the remaining assets and liabilities beginning Q1 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157, as amended by FSP 157-2, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to 25 Table of Contents determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of FSP No. 142-3 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 07-05, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock. EITF Issue No. 07-05 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. EITF Issue No. 07-05 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue No. 07-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,697 $ 1,405 $ 702 Investing activities (1,199 ) 42 (333 ) Financing activities (198 ) 50 (400 ) Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.36 billion for 2008, compared to $1.18 billion and $486 million for 2007 and 2006. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income, offset by increased capital expenditures. The increase in free cash flow in 2007 primarily resulted from increased operating income. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $3.7 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion, and $623 million at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12—Income Taxes.” Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion, and $702 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non-retail activities such as through our co-branded credit card agreements, other seller services, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant to SOP 98-1 that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions, equity-method investments and intellectual property rights, 26 Table of Contents and purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(1.2) billion, $42 million, and $(333) million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, and acquisition activity. Capital expenditures were $333 million, $224 million, and $216 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment-related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. Capital expenditures included $128 million, $108 million, and $108 million for internal-use software and website development during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we made payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $494 million, $75 million, and $32 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(198) million, $50 million, and $(400) million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, repayments of long-term debt, and payments on capital lease obligations. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007, and 8.2 million shares of common stock for $252 million in 2006, under the $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2006. Repayments on long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $355 million, $74 million, and $383 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Repayments on long-term debt include $294 million on our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2008, and €250 million ($300 million) of our 6.875% PEACS in 2006. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt.” Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and exercises of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires the reporting of tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions in financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $159 million, $257 million, and $102 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Cash inflows from proceeds from exercise of employee stock options were $11 million, $91 million, and $35 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect cash proceeds from exercises of stock options will decline over time as we continue issuing restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for stock-based awards. In 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded net tax provisions of $247 million, $184 million, and $187 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid were $53 million, $24 million, and $15 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. As our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized, cash paid for taxes will increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a debt repurchase program, replacing our previous debt repurchase authorization in its entirety, pursuant to which we may from time to time repurchase (through open market repurchases or private transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire up to all of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 and 6.875% PEACS. In 2008, we called for redemption all of the remaining principal amount of $899 million of our outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Holders elected to convert $605 million in principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, and we issued 7.8 million shares of our common stock as a result. We redeemed the remaining $294 million of the called principal amount for cash. At December 31, 2008, the debt balance of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was zero, and the debt balance of our 6.875% PEACS was $335 million. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24-month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the February 2008 Board authorization. 27 Table of Contents Since our 6.875% PEACS, which are due in 2010, are denominated in Euros, our U.S. Dollar equivalent interest payments and principal obligations fluctuate with the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate. As a result, any fluctuations in the exchange rate will have an effect on our interest expense and, to the extent we make principal payments, the amount of U.S. Dollar equivalents necessary for principal settlement. Additionally, since our interest payable on our 6.875% PEACS is due in Euros, the balance of interest payable is subject to gains or losses on currency movements until the date of the interest payment. Gains or losses on the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated interest payable are classified as “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 12, 13, and 13 for 2008, 2007, and 2006. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of December 31, 2008: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (in millions) Operating and capital commitments: Debt principal (1) $ 59 $ 335 $ 41 $ 33 $ — $ — $ 468 Debt interest (1) 30 28 5 1 — — 64 Capital leases, including interest 86 77 44 7 4 1 219 Operating leases 146 127 105 93 84 261 816 Other commitments (2)(3) 96 143 88 84 76 1,005 1,492 Purchase obligations (4) 497 — — — — — 497 Total commitments $ 914 $ 710 $ 283 $ 218 $ 164 $ 1,267 $ 3,556 (1) At December 31, 2008, the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 1.3974. Due to changes in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $99 million as of December 31, 2008. The principal and interest commitments reflect the partial redemption of the 6.875% PEACS and full redemption of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent, operating expenses, and tenant improvements associated with approximately 1,360,000 square feet of corporate office space being developed in Seattle, Washington with initial terms of up to 16 years commencing on completion of development in 2010 and 2011, and also includes a $10 million termination fee related to our right to occupy up to an additional approximately 330,000 square feet. The amount of space available and our financial and other obligations under the lease agreements are affected by various factors, including government approvals and permits, interest rates, development costs and other expenses and our exercise of certain rights under the lease agreements. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies—Commitments.” (3) Excludes $166 million of tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if at all. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12—Income Taxes.” (4) Consists primarily of inventory commitments. 28 Table of Contents Pledged Securities We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for standby letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate leases. We classify cash and marketable securities with use restrictions of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The balance of pledged securities at December 31, 2008 consisted of $308 million included in “Other assets.” The amount required to be pledged for certain real estate lease agreements changes over the life of our leases based on our credit rating and changes in our market capitalization (common shares outstanding multiplied by the closing price of our common stock). Information about collateral required to be pledged under these agreements is as follows: Standby and TradeLetters of Creditand Guarantees Debt (1) Real EstateLeases (2) Total (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 138 $ 60 $ 13 $ 211 Net change in collateral pledged — 100 (3 ) 97 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 138 $ 160 $ 10 $ 308 (1) Represents collateral for certain debt related to our international operations. (2) At December 31, 2008, our market capitalization was $22.0 billion. The required amount of collateral to be pledged will increase by $5 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $18.0 billion and by an additional $6 million if our market capitalization is equal to or below $13.0 billion. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Our period-over-period revenue growth was 26% in 2006, 39% in 2007 and 36% for the first three quarters of 2008. For Q4 2008, our quarterly revenue growth rate declined to 18%, driven primarily by decreased consumer demand following disruptions in the global financial markets and changes in foreign exchange rates (excluding the $320 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the fourth quarter, net sales would have grown 24% compared with Q4 2007). See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14—Quarterly Results (Unaudited).” 29 Table of Contents Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 10,228 $ 8,095 $ 5,869 International 8,938 6,740 4,842 Consolidated $ 19,166 $ 14,835 $ 10,711 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 26 % 38 % 25 % International 33 39 28 Consolidated 29 39 26 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 26 % 38 % 24 % International 31 31 28 Consolidated 28 35 26 Net Sales Mix: North America 53 % 55 % 55 % International 47 45 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 29%, 39%, and 26% in 2008, 2007, and 2006, reflecting revenue growth in both our North America and International segments. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected net sales by $127 million, $399 million, and $24 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America revenue growth rate was 26%, 38%, and 25% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. The International revenue growth rate was 33%, 39%, and 28% in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in revenue in each year reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively affected International net sales by $131 million, $390 million, and $18 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See “Supplemental Information” below. 30 Table of Contents Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 2,495 $ 2,031 $ 1,525 International 1,775 1,322 931 Consolidated $ 4,270 $ 3,353 $ 2,456 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 23 % 33 % 20 % International 34 42 21 Consolidated 27 37 20 Gross Margin: North America 24.4 % 25.1 % 26.0 % International 19.9 19.6 19.2 Consolidated 22.3 22.6 22.9 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2008, compared to 2007 and 2006, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by other sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 29%, 28%, and 28% of unit sales in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing. North America segment gross margins in 2007 decreased by 90 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. International segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. 31 Table of Contents International segment gross margins in 2007 increased by 38 basis points compared to 2006 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers, offset partially by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 835 $ 740 $ 567 Outbound shipping costs (1,465 ) (1,174 ) (884 ) Net shipping cost $ (630 ) $ (434 ) $ (317 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 13 % 31 % 11 % Outbound shipping costs 25 33 18 Net shipping cost 45 37 32 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 4.4 % 5.0 % 5.3 % Outbound shipping costs (7.6 ) (7.9 ) (8.3 ) Net shipping cost (3.2 )% (2.9 )% (3.0 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 32 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 5,350 $ 4,630 $ 3,582 Electronics and other general merchandise 4,430 3,139 2,024 Other (1) 448 326 263 Total North America $ 10,228 $ 8,095 $ 5,869 International Media $ 5,734 $ 4,612 $ 3,485 Electronics and other general merchandise 3,110 2,071 1,337 Other (1) 94 57 20 Total International $ 8,938 $ 6,740 $ 4,842 Consolidated Media $ 11,084 $ 9,242 $ 7,067 Electronics and other general merchandise 7,540 5,210 3,361 Other (1) 542 383 283 Total consolidated $ 19,166 $ 14,835 $ 10,711 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 16 % 29 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 41 55 40 Other 38 24 18 Total North America 26 38 25 International Media 24 % 32 % 21 % Electronics and other general merchandise 50 55 51 Other 65 186 151 Total International 33 39 28 Consolidated Media 20 % 31 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 55 44 Other 42 35 23 Total consolidated 29 39 26 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 22 % 25 % 21 % Electronics and other general merchandise 49 45 49 Other 67 165 147 Total International 31 31 28 Consolidated Media 19 % 27 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 44 51 43 Other 42 34 23 Total consolidated 28 35 26 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 58 % 62 % 66 % Electronics and other general merchandise 39 35 31 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as other seller sites, our co-branded credit card agreements, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities. 33 Table of Contents Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 1,658 $ (61 ) $ 1,597 $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 $ 937 $ (24 ) $ 913 Marketing 482 (13 ) 469 344 (8 ) 336 263 (4 ) 259 Technology and content 1,033 (151 ) 882 818 (103 ) 715 662 (54 ) 608 General and administrative 279 (50 ) 229 235 (35 ) 200 195 (19 ) 176 Other operating expense (income), net (24 ) — (24 ) 9 — 9 10 — 10 Total operating expenses $ 3,428 $ (275 ) $ 3,153 $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 $ 2,067 $ (101 ) $ 1,966 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 28 % 27 % 38 % 37 % 26 % 25 % Marketing 40 39 31 30 32 34 Technology and content 26 23 23 17 47 50 General and administrative 19 15 20 13 18 21 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.6 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.7 % 8.5 % Marketing 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.5 2.4 Technology and content 5.4 4.6 5.5 4.8 6.2 5.7 General and administrative 1.5 1.2 1.6 1.3 1.8 1.6 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2008 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, our sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2008, 2007, and 2006 through gains in efficiencies and increases in leased warehouse space. This expansion was designed to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide fulfillment services. We periodically evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. 34 Table of Contents Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, e-mail campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program and sponsored search programs. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See “Overview” above for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2008, 2007, and 2006, we capitalized $187 million, $129 million, and $123 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $143 million, $116 million, and $86 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in spending in general and administrative in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123(R) requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. Stock-based compensation was $275 million, $185 million, and $101 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in stock-based compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, was $(24) million, $9 million and $10 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006. The increase in other operating income in 2008 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily attributable to the $53 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets. Other operating expense in 2007 and 2006 was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets. Income from Operations Income from operations was $842 million, $655 million, and $389 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. The increase in each year is primarily a result of increased revenue and gross profit relative to operating expenses. Additionally, 2008 includes the $53 million non-cash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets included in “Other operating expense (income), net.” Interest Expense and Income The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments, including our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, which were no longer outstanding at December 31, 2008, and our 6.875% PEACS, which had a principal balance of €240 million ($335 million based on the exchange rate) at December 31, 2008. Interest expense was $71 million, $77 million, and $78 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of $899 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2006. Our total debt was $468 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt.” Our interest income was $83 million, $90 million, and $59 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Foreign-currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS (1) $ 15 $ (33 ) $ (37 ) Foreign-currency gain on intercompany balances (2) 23 32 50 Other 9 (7 ) (6 ) Other income (expense), net $ 47 $ (8 ) $ 7 (1) Each period the remeasurement of our 6.875% PEACS from Euros to U.S. Dollars results in gains or losses recorded to “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. (2) Represents the gains (losses) associated with the remeasurement of intercompany balances due to changes in foreign exchange rates. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currency.” 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $247 million, $184 million, and $187 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The effective tax rate in 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2006 was higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate resulting from establishment of our European headquarters in Luxembourg, which we expected to benefit our effective tax rate over time. Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including from accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non-cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 $ 10,687 $ 24 $ 10,711 Gross profit 4,240 30 4,270 3,274 79 3,353 2,455 1 2,456 Operating expenses 3,408 20 3,428 2,648 50 2,698 2,064 3 2,067 Income from operations 832 10 842 626 29 655 391 (2 ) 389 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 17 42 59 5 — 5 (19 ) 7 (12 ) Net income 609 36 645 456 20 476 188 2 190 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 $ 1.07 $ 0.05 $ 1.12 $ 0.44 $ 0.01 $ 0.45 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances.

(3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments, remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS and intercompany balances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 37 Table of Contents Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by operating activities” for 2008, 2007, and 2006 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,697 $ 1,405 $ 702 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (333 ) (224 ) (216 ) Free cash flow $ 1,364 $ 1,181 $ 486 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,199 ) $ 42 $ (333 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (198 ) $ 50 $ (400 ) In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of our compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations. Guidance The Company provided guidance on January 29, 2009 in its earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2009 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $4.525 billion and $4.925 billion, or to grow between 9% and 19% compared with first quarter 2008. 38 Table of Contents • Operating income is expected to be between $125 million and $210 million, or between 37% decline and 6% growth compared with first quarter 2008. This guidance includes approximately $75 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2008 (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2008 Money market funds $ 1,682 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,682 $ 1,682 Weighted average interest rate 0.78 % — — — — — 0.78 % Corporate debt securities 17 44 103 19 11 — 194 194 Weighted average interest rate 5.35 % 5.06 % 4.93 % 5.23 % 5.42 % — 5.06 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 463 47 58 11 7 — 586 594 Weighted average interest rate 0.36 % 2.09 % 2.29 % 3.61 % 3.80 % — 0.79 % Asset backed securities 10 28 20 5 — — 63 58 Weighted average interest rate 8.24 % 9.32 % 8.22 % 6.32 % — — 8.58 % Foreign government and agency securities 915 42 39 62 63 — 1,121 1,128 Weighted average interest rate 1.41 % 3.58 % 4.02 % 3.71 % 3.75 % — 1.84 % Other securities 2 10 — 9 — — 21 23 Weighted average interest rate 3.17 % 1.25 % — 2.30 % — — 1.87 % $ 3,089 $ 171 $ 220 $ 106 $ 81 $ — $ 3,667 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 3,679 39 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2007 (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2007 Money market funds $ 1,558 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,558 $ 1,558 Weighted average interest rate 4.38 % — — — — — 4.38 % Corporate debt securities 7 17 29 53 21 — 127 128 Weighted average interest rate 5.09 % 4.64 % 4.77 % 4.58 % 4.86 % — 4.71 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 122 57 56 40 50 — 325 331 Weighted average interest rate 4.26 % 3.27 % 3.66 % 3.73 % 3.49 % — 3.80 % Asset backed securities 11 35 30 28 1 1 106 106 Weighted average interest rate 5.15 % 4.78 % 4.74 % 4.99 % 4.62 % 4.65 % 4.86 % Foreign government and agency securities 274 31 18 26 9 — 358 357 Weighted average interest rate 4.28 % 3.49 % 3.71 % 3.89 % 3.83 % — 4.15 % Other securities — 4 — — — — 4 4 Weighted average interest rate — 4.53 % — — — — 4.53 % $ 1,972 $ 144 $ 133 $ 147 $ 81 $ 1 $ 2,478 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 2,484 At December 31, 2008, we had debt of $468 million primarily associated with our 6.875% PEACS, which is due in 2010. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. There was no amount of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes outstanding at December 31, 2008. Based upon quoted market prices, the fair value of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of $899 million). The fair value of the 6.875% PEACS was $332 million at December 31, 2008, and $358 million at December 31, 2007 (outstanding principal of €240 million). Foreign Exchange Risk During 2008, net sales from our International segment accounted for 47% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2008, International segment revenues increased $131 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2008 of $1.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $85 million, 40 Table of Contents $170 million, and $335 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale,” as defined by SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the net intercompany balances at December 31, 2008 of $150 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $5 million, $15 million, and $30 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” We have foreign exchange risk related to our 6.875% PEACS, which have an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2008 of €240 million ($335 million, based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008). Due to fluctuations in the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange ratio, which we cannot predict, our remaining principal debt obligation under the 6.875% PEACS since issuance in February 2000 has increased by $99 million as of December 31, 2008. Based on the outstanding 6.875% PEACS principal balance, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% weakening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro would result in additional losses of approximately $17 million, $35 million, and $65 million, recorded to “Other expense (income), net.” Additionally, we have not hedged our interest payments under our 6.875% PEACS to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. Assuming the U.S. Dollar weakens against the Euro by 5%, 10%, and 20%, we would incur $1 million, $2 million, and $5 million additional annual interest expense due solely to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2008, our recorded basis in equity investments was $90 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:43.292214
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell the Kindle e-reader. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, co-branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers, such as online advertising. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 461 million and 446 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 19 Table of Contents We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and our Kindle e-reader, and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 12, 12, and 13 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 68, 62, and 57 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. We are investing in Amazon Web Services, which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business, and in our Kindle e-reader. A continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing-twelve-month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarters. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 20 Table of Contents In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2009 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $23 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment penetration and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitors the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment test. A 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2009 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. 21 Table of Contents Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer-term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2009 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, current economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an approximately $13 million impact on our 2009 consolidated operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 33.1% and 37.1%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable, the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,293 $ 1,697 $ 1,405 Investing activities (2,337 ) (1,199 ) 42 Financing activities (280 ) (198 ) 50 Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.92 billion for 2009, compared to $1.36 billion and $1.18 billion for 2008 and 2007. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital, increased operating income, and increased deferred revenue. The increase in free cash flow in 2008 primarily resulted from increased operating income, offset by increased capital expenditures. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows; accordingly, as such tax benefits decline, a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $6.4 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.1 billion, at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $2.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from sellers, and from non-retail activities such as marketing and promotional agreements, Amazon Web Services, other seller services, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, sellers, developers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital, including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns, as well as changes to non-cash items such as excess stock-based compensation and deferred taxes. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, cash outlays for acquisitions, equity-method investments and intellectual property rights, and purchases of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and internal-use software and website development costs. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(2.3) billion, $(1.2) billion, and $42 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments, partially offset by decreases in cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $373 million, $333 million, and $224 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment-related assets and the development of new features and product offerings on our websites. In 2010 we plan to significantly increase 23 Table of Contents our capital expenditures for additional investments in corporate office space and in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our fulfillment operations and Amazon Web Services. Capital expenditures included $146 million, $128 million, and $108 million for internal-use software and website development during 2009, 2008, and 2007. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we made payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $40 million, $494 million, and $75 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(280) million, $(198) million, and $50 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repayments of long-term debt, payments on capital lease obligations, and repurchases of common stock. Repayments on long-term debt and payments on capital lease obligations were $472 million, $355 million, and $74 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Repayments on long-term debt include $319 million on our 6.875% Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities (“PEACS”) in 2009, and $294 million on our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes in 2008. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt.” We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock for $248 million in 2007 under the $500 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2006. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows (outflows) from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $105 million, $159 million, and $257 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007. In 2009, 2008, and 2007 we recorded net tax provisions of $253 million, $247 million, and $184 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $48 million, $53 million, and $24 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. As our federal and state net operating losses and tax credits are utilized, cash paid for taxes will increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, pursuant to which we repurchased $252 million and $248 million of our common stock in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In April 2007, our Board authorized a new 24-month program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock, which was replaced in February 2008 by a 24-month program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $100 million of our common stock in 2008 under the February 2008 Board authorization. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2009. In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock which replaces the Board’s prior authorization. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 12, 12, and 13 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. Inventory turnover has declined slightly over the last several years, primarily due to category expansion and changes in product mix, and our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, which enables faster delivery of products to our customers. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. 24 Table of Contents We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 12,828 $ 10,228 $ 8,095 International 11,681 8,938 6,740 Consolidated $ 24,509 $ 19,166 $ 14,835 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 25 % 26 % 38 % International 31 33 39 Consolidated 28 29 39 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 26 % 26 % 38 % International 33 31 31 Consolidated 29 28 35 Net Sales Mix: North America 52 % 53 % 55 % International 48 47 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Revenue increased 28%, 29%, and 39% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected net sales by $(182) million, $127 million, and $399 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. For a discussion of the effect on revenue growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America revenue growth rate was 25%, 26%, and 38% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and by increased in-stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. 25 Table of Contents The International revenue growth rate was 31%, 33%, and 39% in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in revenue in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers, and Amazon Prime, and by increased in-stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, as well as a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected International net sales by $(174) million, $131 million, and $390 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Additionally, as we continue to offer increased selection, lower prices, and additional product lines within our electronics and other general merchandise category, we expect to see the relative mix of sales from this category increase. See “Supplemental Information” below. Gross profit information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Gross Profit: North America $ 3,290 $ 2,495 $ 2,031 International 2,241 1,775 1,322 Consolidated $ 5,531 $ 4,270 $ 3,353 Gross Profit Growth Rate: North America 32 % 23 % 33 % International 26 34 42 Consolidated 30 27 37 Gross Margin: North America 25.6 % 24.4 % 25.1 % International 19.2 19.9 19.6 Consolidated 22.6 22.3 22.6 The increase in gross profit in absolute terms during 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007, corresponds with increases in sales, offset by lower prices for customers including from free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Generally, our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors, including our product, service, and geographic mix of sales; sales volumes by other sellers; changes in vendor pricing, including the extent to which we receive discounts and allowances; lowering prices for customers, including from competitive pricing decisions; improvements in product sourcing and inventory management; and the extent to which our customers accept our free shipping and Amazon Prime offers. Such free shipping and Amazon Prime offers reduce shipping revenue and reduce our gross margins on retail sales. We view our shipping offers as an effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 30%, 28%, and 28% of unit sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Since revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount, they generally result in lower revenues but higher gross margin per unit. Since we focus on profit dollars rather than margins, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Gross profit growth is also affected by changes in exchange rates—see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. North America segment gross margins in 2009 increased by 125 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from increases in other revenue, improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing, 26 Table of Contents and increases in sales of products by other sellers, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. North America segment gross margins in 2008 decreased by 69 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by increases in other revenue and improvements in vendor pricing. International segment gross margins in 2009 decreased by 67 basis points compared to 2008 resulting primarily from our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in sales of products by other sellers. International segment gross margins in 2008 increased by 25 basis points compared to 2007 resulting primarily from increases in sales of products by other sellers and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by our efforts to continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and a larger percent of overall sales in lower margin categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 924 $ 835 $ 740 Outbound shipping costs (1,773 ) (1,465 ) (1,174 ) Net shipping cost $ (849 ) $ (630 ) $ (434 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 11 % 13 % 31 % Outbound shipping costs 21 25 33 Net shipping cost 35 45 37 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.8 % 4.4 % 5.0 % Outbound shipping costs (7.2 ) (7.6 ) (7.9 ) Net shipping cost (3.4 )% (3.2 )% (2.9 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers that result in a net cost to us in delivering products, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. To the extent our customers accept and use our free shipping offers at an increasing rate, including memberships in Amazon Prime, our net cost of shipping will increase. We seek to partially mitigate the costs of lowering prices over time through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. 27 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 5,964 $ 5,350 $ 4,630 Electronics and other general merchandise 6,314 4,430 3,139 Other (1) 550 448 326 Total North America $ 12,828 $ 10,228 $ 8,095 International Media $ 6,810 $ 5,734 $ 4,612 Electronics and other general merchandise 4,768 3,110 2,071 Other (1) 103 94 57 Total International $ 11,681 $ 8,938 $ 6,740 Consolidated Media $ 12,774 $ 11,084 $ 9,242 Electronics and other general merchandise 11,082 7,540 5,210 Other (1) 653 542 383 Total consolidated $ 24,509 $ 19,166 $ 14,835 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 11 % 16 % 29 % Electronics and other general merchandise 43 41 55 Other 23 38 24 Total North America 25 26 38 International Media 19 % 24 % 32 % Electronics and other general merchandise 53 50 55 Other 9 65 186 Total International 31 33 39 Consolidated Media 15 % 20 % 31 % Electronics and other general merchandise 47 45 55 Other 20 42 35 Total consolidated 28 29 39 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 20 % 22 % 25 % Electronics and other general merchandise 56 49 45 Other 19 67 165 Total International 33 31 31 Consolidated Media 16 % 19 % 27 % Electronics and other general merchandise 48 44 51 Other 22 42 34 Total consolidated 29 28 35 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 52 % 58 % 62 % Electronics and other general merchandise 45 39 35 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as marketing and promotional activities, Amazon Web Services, other seller sites, and our co-branded credit card agreements. 28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2009 Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Fulfillment $ 2,052 $ (79 ) $ 1,973 $ 1,658 $ (61 ) $ 1,597 $ 1,292 $ (39 ) $ 1,253 Marketing 680 (20 ) 660 482 (13 ) 469 344 (8 ) 336 Technology and content 1,240 (182 ) 1,058 1,033 (151 ) 882 818 (103 ) 715 General and administrative 328 (60 ) 268 279 (50 ) 229 235 (35 ) 200 Other operating expense (income), net 102 — 102 (24 ) — (24 ) 9 — 9 Total operating expenses $ 4,402 $ (341 ) $ 4,061 $ 3,428 $ (275 ) $ 3,153 $ 2,698 $ (185 ) $ 2,513 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 24 % 24 % 28 % 27 % 38 % 37 % Marketing 41 41 40 39 31 30 Technology and content 20 20 26 23 23 17 General and administrative 17 17 19 15 20 13 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.6 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.4 % Marketing 2.8 2.7 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.3 Technology and content 5.1 4.3 5.4 4.6 5.5 4.8 General and administrative 1.3 1.1 1.5 1.2 1.6 1.3 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Fulfillment The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars during 2009 in comparison with the prior years relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels; our mix of product sales; payment processing and related transaction costs, including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We periodically evaluate our facility requirements. 29 Table of Contents Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect. Marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels, such as our Associates program and sponsored search programs. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web services. See “Overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees to our staff and add technology infrastructure. For the years ended 2009, 2008, and 2007, we capitalized $187 million, $187 million, and $129 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $172 million, $143 million, and $116 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. A significant majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to our North America segment. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $341 million, $275 million, and $185 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in total stock-based compensation value granted to our employees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, was $102 million, $(24) million and $9 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The increase in other operating expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to the $51 million Toysrus.com LLC settlement, and increased amortization expense on acquired intangibles. In 2008, we recognized a $53 million noncash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $37 million, $83 million, and $90 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. 30 Table of Contents The primary component of our net interest expense is the interest we incur on our long-term debt instruments. Interest expense was $34 million, $71 million, and $77 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007 with the decline primarily relating to principal reductions of $319 million in 2009 and $899 million in 2008. Our long-term debt was $109 million and $409 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt.” Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Foreign-currency gain on intercompany balances $ 5 $ 23 $ 32 Foreign-currency gain (loss) on remeasurement of 6.875% PEACS 16 15 (33 ) Other 8 9 (7 ) Other income (expense), net $ 29 $ 47 $ (8 ) Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $253 million, $247 million, and $184 million, in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The effective tax rate in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including our accuracy in predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits, net operating losses, and tax credits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As such, we expect a majority of our net tax provision to be non-cash. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, 2007 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 24,691 $ (182 ) $ 24,509 $ 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 $ 14,436 $ 399 $ 14,835 Gross profit 5,605 (74 ) 5,531 4,240 30 4,270 3,274 79 3,353 Operating expenses 4,435 (33 ) 4,402 3,408 20 3,428 2,648 50 2,698 Income from operations 1,170 (41 ) 1,129 832 10 842 626 29 655 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 6 26 32 17 42 59 5 — 5 Net income 911 (9 ) 902 609 36 645 456 20 476 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.06 $ (0.02 ) $ 2.04 $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 $ 1.07 $ 0.05 $ 1.12 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. 31 Table of Contents (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments, and remeasurement of our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measure of “Free cash flow” meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” for 2009, 2008, and 2007 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,293 $ 1,697 $ 1,405 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (373 ) (333 ) (224 ) Free cash flow $ 2,920 $ 1,364 $ 1,181 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (2,337 ) $ (1,199 ) $ 42 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (280 ) $ (198 ) $ 50 In addition, we provide information regarding our operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. 32 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on January 28, 2010 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2010 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $6.45 billion and $7.00 billion, or to grow between 32% and 43% compared with first quarter 2009. • Operating income is expected to be between $275 million and $365 million, or to grow between 13% and 50% compared with first quarter 2009. This guidance includes approximately $110 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. As noted in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” we are prospectively adopting Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2009-13 as of January 1, 2010. The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in our first quarter 2010 guidance. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. 33 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2009 (in millions, except percentages): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2009 Money market funds $ 2,750 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,750 $ 2,750 Weighted average interest rate 0.09 % — — — — — 0.09 % Corporate debt securities 45 109 42 6 — — 202 211 Weighted average interest rate 1.39 % 1.87 % 2.57 % 2.98 % — — 1.94 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 551 213 453 14 9 — 1,240 1,268 Weighted average interest rate 0.24 % 1.57 % 1.83 % 3.27 % 3.12 % — 1.10 % Asset backed securities 11 21 12 — — — 44 46 Weighted average interest rate 1.84 % 3.81 % 3.54 % — — — 3.25 % Foreign government and agency securities 1,549 102 287 36 8 — 1,982 1,999 Weighted average interest rate 0.40 % 1.13 % 1.54 % 1.98 % 2.45 % — 0.64 % Other securities — 6 — — — — 6 6 Weighted average interest rate — 1.69 % — — — — 1.69 % $ 4,906 $ 451 $ 794 $ 56 $ 17 $ — $ 6,224 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 6,280 The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2008 (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2008 Money market funds $ 1,682 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,682 $ 1,682 Weighted average interest rate 0.78 % — — — — — 0.78 % Corporate debt securities 17 44 103 19 11 — 194 194 Weighted average interest rate 5.35 % 5.06 % 4.93 % 5.23 % 5.42 % — 5.06 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 463 47 58 11 7 — 586 594 Weighted average interest rate 0.36 % 2.09 % 2.29 % 3.61 % 3.80 % — 0.79 % Asset backed securities 10 28 20 5 — — 63 58 Weighted average interest rate 8.24 % 9.32 % 8.22 % 6.32 % — — 8.58 % Foreign government and agency securities 915 42 39 62 63 — 1,121 1,128 Weighted average interest rate 1.41 % 3.58 % 4.02 % 3.71 % 3.75 % — 1.84 % Other securities 2 10 — 9 — — 21 23 Weighted average interest rate 3.17 % 1.25 % — 2.30 % — — 1.87 % $ 3,089 $ 171 $ 220 $ 106 $ 81 $ — $ 3,667 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 3,679 34 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2009, net sales from our International segment accounted for 48% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2009, International segment revenues decreased $174 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2009 of $2.8 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $140 million, $275 million, and $550 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in foreign currency. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2009 of $260 million, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in relation to these foreign currencies would result in losses of $15 million, $25 million, and $50 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See “Effect of Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2009, our recorded basis in equity investments was $91 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 35 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:38.095934
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell the Kindle e-reader. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as AWS, fulfillment, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, such as online advertising, and co-branded credit cards. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 465 million and 461 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 19 Table of Contents preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and AWS; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and our Kindle e-reader; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts available to us from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 11, 12, and 12 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 72, 68, and 62 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support AWS. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. We are investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business, and in our Kindle e-reader. A continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. 2 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 3 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing-twelve-month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter-ends. 4 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 20 Table of Contents For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2010 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $33 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2010 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to 21 Table of Contents determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer-term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2010 closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $17 million impact on our 2010 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were 29.7% and 33.1%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity of estimating forfeitures. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable, the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,495 $ 3,293 $ 1,697 Investing activities (3,360 ) (2,337 ) (1,199 ) Financing activities 181 (280 ) (198 ) Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.52 billion for 2010, compared to $2.92 billion and $1.36 billion for 2009 and 2008. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2010 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and utilization of excess stock-based compensation deductions, partially offset by increases in operating income. The increase in free cash flow in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in working capital, increased operating income, and increased deferred revenue. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows; accordingly, as such tax benefits decline, a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $8.8 billion, $6.4 billion, and $3.7 billion, at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $3.4 billion, $2.8 billion, and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion, $3.3 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from customers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital, including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns, as well as changes to non-cash items such as excess stock-based compensation and deferred taxes. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, and cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(3.4) billion, $(2.3) billion, and $(1.2) billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008, with the variability caused primarily by increased capital expenditures, increases in cash paid for acquisitions, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments. Capital expenditures were $979 million, $373 million, and $333 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure including AWS, additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, and, in 2010, investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue over time. 23 Table of Contents Capital expenditures included $176 million, $146 million, and $128 million for internal-use software and website development during 2010, 2009, and 2008. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2010, 2009, and 2008, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $352 million, $40 million, and $494 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $181 million, $(280) million, and $(198) million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Cash outflows from financing activities result from payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, repayments of long-term debt, and repurchases of common stock. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, and repayments of long-term debt, were $221 million, $472 million, and $355 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $100 million in 2008 under the $1 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in February 2008. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and proceeds from long-term debt. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $143 million, $87 million, and $98 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows (outflows) from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $259 million, $105 million, and $159 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. In 2010, 2009, and 2008 we recorded net tax provisions of $352 million, $253 million, and $247 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have current tax benefits and net operating loss carryforwards relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $75 million, $48 million, and $53 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of $227 million. Once we use our credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, which replaces the prior February 2008 repurchase authorization described above. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in 2010 or 2009. Additionally, in November 2010 and January 2011, we signed agreements to acquire Quidsi, Inc. and LOVEFiLM International Limited for aggregate consideration of approximately $660 million, primarily in cash, and the assumption of debt. We expect the acquisitions to close in 2011, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. On average, our high inventory turnover means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 11, 12, and 12 for 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including category expansion and changes in our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further 24 Table of Contents strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 18,707 $ 12,828 $ 10,228 International 15,497 11,681 8,938 Consolidated $ 34,204 $ 24,509 $ 19,166 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 46 % 25 % 26 % International 33 31 33 Consolidated 40 28 29 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 46 % 26 % 26 % International 34 33 31 Consolidated 40 29 28 Net Sales Mix: North America 55 % 52 % 53 % International 45 48 47 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales increased 40%, 28%, and 29% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected net sales by $(86) million, $(182) million, and $127 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America sales growth rate was 46%, 25%, and 26% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, and, in 2010, our adoption of the new accounting standard update (“ASU”) 2009-13 (see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies”). Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, by increased in-stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings, and by the impact of Zappos, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009. 25 Table of Contents The International sales growth rate was 33%, 31%, and 33% in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales and a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime, and by increased in-stock inventory availability and increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected International net sales by $(107) million, $(174) million, and $131 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Sales of products by marketplace sellers on our websites represented 31%, 30%, and 28% of unit sales in 2010, 2009, and 2008. Revenues from these sales are recorded as a net amount. Because we focus on operating profits, we are largely neutral on whether an item is sold by us or by another seller. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 1,193 $ 924 $ 835 Outbound shipping costs (2,579 ) (1,773 ) (1,465 ) Net shipping cost $ (1,386 ) $ (849 ) $ (630 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 29 % 11 % 13 % Outbound shipping costs 45 21 25 Net shipping cost 63 35 45 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.5 % 3.8 % 4.4 % Outbound shipping costs (7.5 ) (7.2 ) (7.6 ) Net shipping cost (4.0 )% (3.4 )% (3.2 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes amounts earned from Amazon Prime membership and Fulfillment by Amazon programs. We expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our free-shipping offers at an increasing rate, including through membership in Amazon Prime; to the extent our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category; to the extent we reduce shipping rates; and to the extent we use more expensive shipping methods. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success. One way we offer lower prices is through free-shipping offers, as well as through membership in Amazon Prime. 26 Table of Contents Supplemental information about our net sales is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 6,881 $ 5,964 $ 5,350 Electronics and other general merchandise 10,998 6,314 4,430 Other (1) 828 550 448 Total North America $ 18,707 $ 12,828 $ 10,228 International Media $ 8,007 $ 6,810 $ 5,734 Electronics and other general merchandise 7,365 4,768 3,110 Other (1) 125 103 94 Total International $ 15,497 $ 11,681 $ 8,938 Consolidated Media $ 14,888 $ 12,774 $ 11,084 Electronics and other general merchandise 18,363 11,082 7,540 Other (1) 953 653 542 Total consolidated $ 34,204 $ 24,509 $ 19,166 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 15 % 11 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 74 43 41 Other 50 23 38 Total North America 46 25 26 International Media 18 % 19 % 24 % Electronics and other general merchandise 54 53 50 Other 22 9 65 Total International 33 31 33 Consolidated Media 17 % 15 % 20 % Electronics and other general merchandise 66 47 45 Other 46 20 42 Total consolidated 40 28 29 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 18 % 20 % 22 % Electronics and other general merchandise 57 56 49 Other 24 19 67 Total International 34 33 31 Consolidated Media 16 % 16 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 67 48 44 Other 46 22 42 Total consolidated 40 29 28 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 43 % 52 % 58 % Electronics and other general merchandise 54 45 39 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as AWS, miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities, other seller sites, and our co-branded credit card agreements. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2010 Year ended December 31, 2009 Year ended December 31, 2008 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Cost of Sales $ 26,561 $ — $ 26,561 $ 18,978 $ — $ 18,978 $ 14,896 $ — $ 14,896 Fulfillment 2,898 (90 ) 2,808 2,052 (79 ) 1,973 1,658 (61 ) 1,597 Marketing 1,029 (27 ) 1,002 680 (20 ) 660 482 (13 ) 469 Technology and content 1,734 (223 ) 1,511 1,240 (182 ) 1,058 1,033 (151 ) 882 General and administrative 470 (84 ) 386 328 (60 ) 268 279 (50 ) 229 Other operating expense (income), net 106 — 106 102 — 102 (24 ) — (24 ) Total operating expenses $ 32,798 $ (424 ) $ 32,375 $ 23,380 $ (341 ) $ 23,039 $ 18,324 $ (275 ) $ 18,049 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 41 % 42 % 24 % 24 % 28 % 27 % Marketing 51 52 41 41 40 39 Technology and content 40 43 20 20 26 23 General and administrative 44 45 17 17 19 15 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 8.5 % 8.2 % 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.6 % 8.3 % Marketing 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.5 2.4 Technology and content 5.1 4.4 5.1 4.3 5.4 4.6 General and administrative 1.4 1.1 1.3 1.1 1.5 1.2 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and content where we are the seller of record, inbound and outbound shipping charges, and packaging supplies. Shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. 28 Table of Contents Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Gross Profit (in millions) $ 7,643 $ 5,531 $ 4,270 Gross Margin 22.3 % 22.6 % 22.3 % Gross margin for 2010 remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with sales volume, inventory levels, and product sales mix; payment processing and related transaction costs; and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as sponsored search programs and our Associates program, and, in 2010, on television advertising. While costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense, we view free shipping offers and Amazon Prime as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support AWS. See “Overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. 29 Table of Contents The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and increased spending on technology infrastructure. We expect these trends to continue over time. For the years ended 2010, 2009, and 2008, we capitalized $213 million, $187 million, and $187 million of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $184 million, $172 million, and $143 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure and other technology costs used to support AWS are included in technology and content. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2010 and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $424 million, $341 million, and $275 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in total stock-based compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $106 million, $102 million, and $(24) million during 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2010, the amount primarily related to amortization of intangible assets, in 2009, the amount included amortization of intangible assets and a $51 million legal settlement, and in 2008, the balance included amortization of intangible assets and a $53 million noncash gain on the sale of our European DVD rental assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $51 million, $37 million, and $83 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. The primary component of our net interest expense is related to our capital and financing leases and our long-term debt. Interest expense was $39 million, $34 million, and $71 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The decline in 2009 primarily relates to principal reductions of long term debt of $319 million. Our long-term liabilities were $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Liabilities.” Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $79 million, $29 million, and $47 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008. The primary component of other income (expense), net, is related to foreign-currency gain on intercompany balances. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $352 million, $253 million, and $247 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The effective tax rate in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the U.S. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, and foreign currencies. We have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. We used substantially all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2010 and have available federal tax credits of $227 million. As a result of new U.S. legislation that became effective in December 2010, we are able to accelerate our depreciation deductions for qualifying property acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010. This accelerated depreciation deduction will continue for qualifying property acquired in 2011. Equity–Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity–method investment activity, net of tax, was $7 million, $(6) million, and $(9) million in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The increase in equity-method investment activity in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the recognition of a non-cash gain on a previously held equity position in a company that was acquired in 2010. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2010 Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 34,290 $ (86 ) $ 34,204 $ 24,691 $ (182 ) $ 24,509 19,039 $ 127 $ 19,166 Operating expenses 32,856 (58 ) 32,798 23,522 (142 ) 23,380 18,206 118 18,324 Income from operations 1,434 (28 ) 1,406 1,170 (41 ) 1,129 832 10 842 Net interest income (expense) and other (3) 17 74 91 6 26 32 17 42 59 Net income 1,118 34 1,152 911 (9 ) 902 609 36 645 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.45 $ 0.08 $ 2.53 $ 2.06 $ (0.02 ) $ 2.04 $ 1.41 $ 0.08 $ 1.49 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results, and if we did not incur the variability associated with remeasurements for our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. (3) Includes foreign currency gains and losses on cross-currency investments, and remeasurement of our intercompany balances and 6.875% PEACS, which we redeemed in 2009. 31 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of “Free cash flow,” operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statement of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” for 2010, 2009, and 2008 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,495 $ 3,293 $ 1,697 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (979 ) (373 ) (333 ) Free cash flow $ 2,516 $ 2,920 $ 1,364 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (3,360 ) $ (2,337 ) $ (1,199 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 181 $ (280 ) $ (198 ) Operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. 32 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on January 27, 2011 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as follows: First Quarter 2011 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, or to grow between 28% and 39% compared with first quarter 2010. • Operating income is expected to be between $260 million and $385 million, or between 34% decline and 2% decline compared with first quarter 2010. This guidance includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2010 (in millions, except percentages): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2010 Money market funds $ 1,882 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,882 $ 1,882 Weighted average interest rate 0.11 % — — — — — 0.11 % Corporate debt securities 90 128 219 1 — — 438 459 Weighted average interest rate 1.11 % 1.58 % 2.01 % 2.57 % — — 1.70 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 2,624 950 137 1 — — 3,712 3,756 Weighted average interest rate 0.17 % 0.72 % 1.57 % 2.86 % — — 0.36 % Asset backed securities 13 12 7 — — 32 33 Weighted average interest rate 2.18 % 1.83 % 2.01 % — — 2.01 % Foreign government and agency securities 1,346 410 337 30 — — 2,123 2,158 Weighted average interest rate 0.37 % 0.84 % 1.28 % 1.66 % — — 0.62 % Other securities 10 5 1 — — — 16 17 Weighted average interest rate 1.05 % 1.34 % 2.03 % — — 1.22 % $ 5,965 $ 1,505 $ 701 $ 32 $ — $ — $ 8,203 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed- income securities $ 8,305 33 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2010, net sales from our International segment accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2010, International segment revenues decreased $107 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2010 of $3.4 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $172 million, $345 million, and $689 million. All investments are classified as “available for sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2010, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign currency exchange rates would result in losses of $40 million, $90 million, and $195 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Effect of Exchange Rates,” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2010, our recorded basis in equity investments was $279 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales or acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 34 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:40.762489
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell Kindle devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales. We also offer other services such as AWS, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, such as online advertising, and co-branded credit cards. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 468 million and 465 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010. 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 2 Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 18 Table of Contents We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and AWS; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites, our Kindle devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts available to us from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 10, 11, and 12 for 2011, 2010, and 2009. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 74, 72, and 68 for 2011, 2010, and 2009. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies, and support AWS. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and devices. We are also investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. 3 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 4 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing-twelve-month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter-ends. 5 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 19 Table of Contents For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2011 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $50 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2011 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine 20 Table of Contents whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2011, closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $24 million impact on our 2011 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were 28% and 30%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax positions and determining our provision and accruals for these taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made, as well as prior and subsequent periods. If we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable, the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock-based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements, but was claimed on the tax return. Since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations, the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders’ equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,903 $ 3,495 $ 3,293 Investing activities (1,930 ) (3,360 ) (2,337 ) Financing activities (482 ) 181 (280 ) Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.09 billion for 2011, compared to $2.52 billion and $2.92 billion for 2010 and 2009. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2011 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and changes in working capital, partially offset by increases in sales of gift certificates to our customers, decreased tax benefits on excess stock-based compensation deductions, and increases in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in free cash flow in 2010 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and utilization of excess stock-based compensation deductions, partially offset by increases in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented in the statement of cash flows as financing cash inflows; accordingly, as such tax benefits decline, a greater amount of cash is classified as operating cash inflow. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures, and our federal taxable income. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $9.6 billion, $8.8 billion, and $6.4 billion, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.3 billion in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. Changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital, including changes to receivable and payable days and inventory turns, as well as changes to non-cash items such as excess stock-based compensation and deferred taxes. Cash used in investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $(1.9) billion, $(3.4) billion, and $(2.3) billion in 2011, 2010, and 2009, with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures and changes in cash paid for acquisitions, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments. Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion, $979 million, and $373 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, with the sequential increases primarily reflecting additional investments in 22 Table of Contents support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We expect this trend to continue over time. Capital expenditures included $256 million, $176 million, and $146 million for internal-use software and website development during 2011, 2010, and 2009. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and investment activity of $705 million, $352 million, and $40 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(482) million, $181 million, and $(280) million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Cash outflows from financing activities result from payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, repurchases of common stock, and repayments of long-term debt. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of long-term debt, were $444 million, $221 million, and $472 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for $277 million in 2011 under the $2 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2010. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long term-debt and proceeds from tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $177 million, $143 million, and $87 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $62 million, $259 million, and $105 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 we recorded net tax provisions of $291 million, $352 million, and $253 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Except as required under U.S. tax law, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. At December 31, 2011, amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were $3.6 billion, which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $2.0 billion. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate them. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $33 million, $75 million, and $48 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009. As of December 31, 2011, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $384 million. We also have approximately $273 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Once we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $3 billion at December 31, 2011. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancelable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. On average, our high inventory turnover means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 10, 11, and 12 for 2011, 2010, and 2009. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including category expansion and changes in our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. We believe that current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further 23 Table of Contents strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our chief executive reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales Net sales include product and services sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record. Services sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, digital content subscriptions, and non-retail activities. Net sales information is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Net Sales: North America $ 26,705 $ 18,707 $ 12,828 International 21,372 15,497 11,681 Consolidated $ 48,077 $ 34,204 $ 24,509 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 43 % 46 % 25 % International 38 33 31 Consolidated 41 40 28 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 43 % 46 % 26 % International 31 34 33 Consolidated 37 40 29 Net Sales Mix: North America 56 % 55 % 52 % International 44 45 48 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales increased 41%, 40%, and 28% in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected net sales by $1.1 billion, $(86) million, and $(182) million for 2011, 2010, and 2009. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. The North America sales growth rate was 43%, 46%, and 25% in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, North America sales growth reflects increased AWS activity. 24 Table of Contents The International sales growth rate was 38%, 33%, and 31% in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by a larger base of sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates positively (negatively) affected International net sales by $1.1 billion, $(107) million, and $(174) million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2) $ 1,552 $ 1,193 $ 924 Outbound shipping costs (3,989 ) (2,579 ) (1,773 ) Net shipping cost $ (2,437 ) $ (1,386 ) $ (849 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 30 % 29 % 11 % Outbound shipping costs 55 45 21 Net shipping cost 76 63 35 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.2 % 3.5 % 3.8 % Outbound shipping costs (8.3 ) (7.5 ) (7.2 ) Net shipping cost (5.1 )% (4.0 )% (3.4 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships. We expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate; to the extent our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category; to the extent we reduce shipping rates; to the extent we use more expensive shipping methods; and to the extent we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. 25 Table of Contents Net sales by similar products and services were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Net Sales: North America Media $ 7,959 $ 6,881 $ 5,964 Electronics and other general merchandise 17,315 10,998 6,314 Other (1) 1,431 828 550 Total North America $ 26,705 $ 18,707 $ 12,828 International Media $ 9,820 $ 8,007 $ 6,810 Electronics and other general merchandise 11,397 7,365 4,768 Other (1) 155 125 103 Total International $ 21,372 $ 15,497 $ 11,681 Consolidated Media $ 17,779 $ 14,888 $ 12,774 Electronics and other general merchandise 28,712 18,363 11,082 Other (1) 1,586 953 653 Total consolidated $ 48,077 $ 34,204 $ 24,509 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 16 % 15 % 11 % Electronics and other general merchandise 57 74 43 Other 73 50 23 Total North America 43 46 25 International Media 23 % 18 % 19 % Electronics and other general merchandise 55 54 53 Other 24 22 9 Total International 38 33 31 Consolidated Media 19 % 17 % 15 % Electronics and other general merchandise 56 66 47 Other 66 46 20 Total consolidated 41 40 28 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 16 % 18 % 20 % Electronics and other general merchandise 47 57 56 Other 18 24 19 Total International 31 34 33 Consolidated Media 16 % 16 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 53 67 48 Other 66 46 22 Total consolidated 37 40 29 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 37 % 43 % 52 % Electronics and other general merchandise 60 54 45 Other 3 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes non-retail activities, such as AWS, miscellaneous marketing and promotional activities, other seller sites, and our co-branded credit card agreements. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Cost of sales $ 37,288 $ — $ 37,288 $ 26,561 $ — $ 26,561 $ 18,978 $ — $ 18,978 Fulfillment 4,576 (133 ) 4,443 2,898 (90 ) 2,808 2,052 (79 ) 1,973 Marketing 1,630 (39 ) 1,591 1,029 (27 ) 1,002 680 (20 ) 660 Technology and content 2,909 (292 ) 2,617 1,734 (223 ) 1,511 1,240 (182 ) 1,058 General and administrative 658 (93 ) 565 470 (84 ) 386 328 (60 ) 268 Other operating expense (income), net 154 — 154 106 — 106 102 — 102 Total operating expenses $ 47,215 $ (557 ) $ 46,658 $ 32,798 $ (424 ) $ 32,374 $ 23,380 $ (341 ) $ 23,039 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 58 % 58 % 41 % 42 % 24 % 24 % Marketing 58 59 51 52 41 41 Technology and content 68 73 40 43 20 20 General and administrative 40 46 44 45 17 17 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 9.5 % 9.2 % 8.5 % 8.2 % 8.4 % 8.1 % Marketing 3.4 3.3 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 Technology and content 6.1 5.4 5.1 4.4 5.1 4.3 General and administrative 1.4 1.2 1.4 1.1 1.3 1.1 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record, inbound and outbound shipping charges, and packaging supplies. Shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2011, 2010, and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product, digital content, including Prime Instant Video, and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Gross profit (in millions) $ 10,789 $ 7,643 $ 5,531 Gross margin 22.4 % 22.3 % 22.6 % Gross margin for 2011 remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. 27 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2011, 2010, and 2009, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with physical and digital product and services sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2011, 2010, and 2009, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as sponsored search programs and our Associates program, payroll and related expenses, and in 2011 and 2010 television and print advertising. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms, digital initiatives, AWS and expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, as well as technology infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2011, 2010, and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure and increases in payroll and related expenses. Spending in technology and content significantly increased in 2011, and we expect this trend to continue over time as we invest in these areas by adding technology infrastructure and increasing payroll and related expenses. See “Overview” for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation. For 2011, 2010, and 2009, we capitalized $307 million (including $51 million of stock-based compensation), $213 million (including $38 million of stock-based compensation), and $187 million (including $35 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of 28 Table of Contents previously capitalized amounts was $236 million, $184 million, and $172 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure and other technology costs used to support AWS are included in technology and content. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2011, 2010, and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $557 million, $424 million, and $341 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009. The increase in 2011, 2010, and 2009 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in total stock-based compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $154 million, $106 million, and $102 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, the amounts primarily related to amortization of intangible assets and additionally, in 2009, a $51 million legal settlement. Income from Operations For the reasons discussed above, income from operations decreased 39% in 2011 and increased 25% and 34% in 2010 and 2009. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $61 million, $51 million, and $37 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. The primary component of our interest expense is related to our capital and financing leases and our long-term debt. Interest expense was $65 million, $39 million, and $34 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Our long-term liabilities were $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Liabilities.” Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $76 million, $79 million, and $29 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009. The primary component of other income (expense), net, is related to foreign-currency gains on intercompany balances. Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $291 million, $352 million, and $253 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The effective tax rate in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in 29 Table of Contents the U.S. Earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. primarily relate to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. The favorable effective tax rate impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions is offset by other items, principally losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we may not able to realize a related tax benefit. Depending upon the jurisdictional mix and amount of our income in 2012, the losses for which we may not receive a tax benefit in 2012 could result in an effective tax rate that is higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our taxable income, the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions and investments, foreign exchange rates, and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2011, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $384 million. We also have approximately $273 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Once we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. As a result of U.S. legislation enacted in December 2010, we accelerated our depreciation deductions for qualifying property acquired in 2010 and 2011. Equity–Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity–method investment gains (losses), net of tax, were $(12) million, $7 million, and $(6) million in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The increase in equity-method investment activity in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to $175 million of equity-method losses, partially offset by gains of $163 million as a result of reductions in our equity ownership, through dilution, and a recovery on the sale of an equity position. The increase in equity-method investment activity in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the recognition of a non-cash gain on a previously held equity position in a company that was acquired in 2010. Effect of Exchange Rates The effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 Year EndedDecember 31, 2010 Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported At PriorYearRates (1) ExchangeRateEffect (2) AsReported Net sales $ 46,985 $ 1,092 $ 48,077 $ 34,290 $ (86 ) $ 34,204 $ 24,691 $ (182 ) $ 24,509 Operating expenses 46,176 1,039 47,215 32,856 (58 ) 32,798 23,522 (142 ) 23,380 Income from operations 809 53 862 1,434 (28 ) 1,406 1,170 (41 ) 1,129 (1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of “Free cash flow,” operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statement of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. 30 Table of Contents Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by operating activities” for 2011, 2010, and 2009 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,903 $ 3,495 $ 3,293 Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development (1,811 ) (979 ) (373 ) Free cash flow $ 2,092 $ 2,516 $ 2,920 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,930 ) $ (3,360 ) $ (2,337 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (482 ) $ 181 $ (280 ) Operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. Guidance We provided guidance on January 31, 2012 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 31, 2012. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below. First Quarter 2012 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $12.0 billion and $13.4 billion, or to grow between 22% and 36% compared with first quarter 2011. 31 Table of Contents • Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(200) million and $100 million, or between 162% decline and 69% decline compared with first quarter 2011. • This guidance includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. These projections are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2011 (in millions, except percentages): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2011 Money market funds $ 3,651 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,651 $ 3,651 Weighted average interest rate 0.06 % — — — — — 0.06 % Corporate debt securities 140 280 124 1 — — 545 563 Weighted average interest rate 1.46 % 1.88 % 2.01 % 1.66 % — — 1.80 % U.S .

Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2011, International segment revenues increased $1.1 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2011 of $4.1 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $205 million, $405 million, and $815 million. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2011, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $55 million, $110 million, and $220 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Effect of Exchange Rates,” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2011, our recorded basis in equity investments was $266 million. These investments primarily relate to equity-method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 33 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:40.990586
1018724,AMZN,AMAZON COM INC,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell Kindle devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers as services sales. We also offer other services such as AWS, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 470 million and 468 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. 1 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 2 Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 18 Table of Contents We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites, our Kindle devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts available to us from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 9, 10, and 11 for 2012, 2011, and 2010. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 76, 74, and 72 for 2012, 2011, and 2010. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories and offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and devices. We are also investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which 3 The operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 4 Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing-twelve-month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter-ends. 5 Accounts payable days, calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales, multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter. 19 Table of Contents may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method, and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance at December 31, 2012 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $60 million. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10% decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of December 31, 2012 would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill. 20 Table of Contents Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our December 31, 2012, closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee class, economic environment, and historical experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. A 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $22 million impact on our 2012 operating income. Our estimated forfeiture rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011, were 27% and 28%. We utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, by acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, with a number of countries actively considering changes in this regard. In addition, we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,180 $ 3,903 $ 3,495 Investing activities (3,595 ) (1,930 ) (3,360 ) Financing activities 2,259 (482 ) 181 Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $395 million for 2012, compared to $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for 2011 and 2010. See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in free cash flow in 2012 and 2011, compared to the comparable prior year periods, was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by higher operating cash flows. Operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures, and our net income. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $11.4 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.8 billion, at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.1 billion, $4.1 billion, and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. Cash provided by operating activities was $4.2 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our consumer, seller, and enterprise customers, and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2012, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to increases in non-cash expenses partially offset by the decrease in net income; additions to unearned revenue; and changes in working capital; partially offset by increased tax benefits on excess stock-based compensation deductions. The increase in operating cash flow in 2011, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to additions to unearned revenue; increases in sales of gift certificates to our customers; decreased tax benefits on excess stock-based compensation deductions; and the increase in net income, excluding depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation; partially offset by changes in working capital. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $(3.6) billion, $(1.9) billion, and $(3.4) billion in 2012, 2011, and 2010, with the variability caused primarily by changes in capital expenditures and changes in cash paid for acquisitions, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities and other investments. Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion, $1.8 billion, and $979 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, with the increases primarily reflecting the purchase of property in 2012, and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment 22 Table of Contents operations during all three periods. We expect this trend to continue over time. The purchase of property in 2012 included the acquisition of 11 buildings comprising 1.8 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in Seattle, Washington for $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures included $381 million, $256 million, and $176 million for internal-use software and website development during 2012, 2011, and 2010. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $745 million, $705 million, and $352 million. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $2.3 billion, $(482) million, and $181 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Cash outflows from financing activities result from repurchases of common stock, payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, and repayments of long-term debt. Payments on obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements and repayments of long-term debt, were $588 million, $444 million, and $221 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. We repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $960 million in 2012 and 1.5 million shares of common stock for $277 million in 2011 under the $2.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2010. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $3.4 billion, $177 million, and $143 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. During 2012, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in three tranches: $750 million of 0.65% notes due in 2015; $1.0 billion of 1.20% notes due in 2017; and $1.3 billion of 2.50% notes due in 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt” for additional discussion of the notes. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $429 million, $62 million, and $259 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. In 2012, 2011, and 2010 we recorded net tax provisions of $428 million, $291 million, and $352 million. A majority of this provision is non-cash. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Except as required under U.S. tax law, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings. At December 31, 2012, cash held by foreign subsidiaries was $4.3 billion, which include undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the U.S. of $2.1 billion. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $112 million, $33 million, and $75 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010. As of December 31, 2012, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $89 million. We also have approximately $136 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. As we utilize our federal tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase. We endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged securities. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $3.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancelable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover was 9, 10, and 11 for 2012, 2011, and 2010. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time as it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. 23 Table of Contents We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Results of Operations We have organized our operations into two principal segments: North America and International. We present our segment information along the same lines that our Chief Executive Officer reviews our operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. Net Sales Net sales include product and services sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital content where we are the seller of record. Services sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, digital content subscriptions, and non-retail activities. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net Sales: North America $ 34,813 $ 26,705 $ 18,707 International 26,280 21,372 15,497 Consolidated $ 61,093 $ 48,077 $ 34,204 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 30 % 43 % 46 % International 23 38 33 Consolidated 27 41 40 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding effect of exchange rates: North America 30 % 43 % 46 % International 27 31 34 Consolidated 29 37 40 Net Sales Mix: North America 57 % 56 % 55 % International 43 44 45 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales increased 27%, 41%, and 40% in 2012, 2011, and 2010, compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(854) million, $1.1 billion, and $(86) million for 2012, 2011, and 2010. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of exchange rates, see “Effect of Exchange Rates” below. 24 Table of Contents North America sales grew 30%, 43%, and 46% in 2012, 2011, and 2010, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by a higher percentage of sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. International sales grew 23%, 38%, and 33% in 2012, 2011, and 2010, compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, partially offset by a higher percentage of sales by marketplace sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise, by increased in-stock inventory availability, and by increased selection of product offerings. Additionally, changes in currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(853) million, $1.1 billion, and $(107) million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. We expect that, over time, our International segment will represent 50% or more of our consolidated net sales. Supplemental Information Supplemental information about shipping results is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Shipping Activity: Shipping revenue (1)(2)(3) $ 2,280 $ 1,552 $ 1,193 Outbound shipping costs (5,134 ) (3,989 ) (2,579 ) Net shipping cost $ (2,854 ) $ (2,437 ) $ (1,386 ) Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Shipping revenue 47 % 30 % 29 % Outbound shipping costs 29 55 45 Net shipping cost 17 76 63 Percent of Net Sales: Shipping revenue 3.7 % 3.2 % 3.5 % Outbound shipping costs (8.4 ) (8.3 ) (7.5 ) Net shipping cost (4.7 )% (5.1 )% (4.0 )% (1) Excludes amounts earned on shipping activities by third-party sellers where we do not provide the fulfillment service. (2) Includes a portion of amounts earned from Amazon Prime memberships. (3) Shipping revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012, includes amounts earned from Fulfillment by Amazon programs related to shipping services. We expect our net cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing placement of fulfillment centers, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. 25 Table of Contents Net sales by similar products and services were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net Sales: North America Media $ 9,189 $ 7,959 $ 6,881 Electronics and other general merchandise 23,273 17,315 10,998 Other (1) 2,351 1,431 828 Total North America $ 34,813 $ 26,705 $ 18,707 International Media $ 10,753 $ 9,820 $ 8,007 Electronics and other general merchandise 15,355 11,397 7,365 Other (1) 172 155 125 Total International $ 26,280 $ 21,372 $ 15,497 Consolidated Media $ 19,942 $ 17,779 $ 14,888 Electronics and other general merchandise 38,628 28,712 18,363 Other (1) 2,523 1,586 953 Total consolidated $ 61,093 $ 48,077 $ 34,204 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America Media 15 % 16 % 15 % Electronics and other general merchandise 34 57 74 Other 64 73 50 Total North America 30 43 46 International Media 9 % 23 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 35 55 54 Other 11 24 22 Total International 23 38 33 Consolidated Media 12 % 19 % 17 % Electronics and other general merchandise 35 56 66 Other 59 66 46 Total consolidated 27 41 40 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Excluding the effect of exchange rates International Media 12 % 16 % 18 % Electronics and other general merchandise 40 47 57 Other 15 18 24 Total International 27 31 34 Consolidated Media 14 % 16 % 16 % Electronics and other general merchandise 36 53 67 Other 59 66 46 Total consolidated 29 37 40 Consolidated Net Sales Mix: Media 33 % 37 % 43 % Electronics and other general merchandise 63 60 54 Other 4 3 3 Total consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Includes sales from non-retail activities, such as AWS in the North America segment, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements in both segments. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2010 AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net AsReported Stock-BasedCompensation Net Operating Expenses: Cost of sales $ 45,971 $ — $ 45,971 $ 37,288 $ — $ 37,288 $ 26,561 $ — $ 26,561 Fulfillment 6,419 (212 ) 6,207 4,576 (133 ) 4,443 2,898 (90 ) 2,808 Marketing 2,408 (61 ) 2,347 1,630 (39 ) 1,591 1,029 (27 ) 1,002 Technology and content 4,564 (434 ) 4,130 2,909 (292 ) 2,617 1,734 (223 ) 1,511 General and administrative 896 (126 ) 770 658 (93 ) 565 470 (84 ) 386 Other operating expense (income), net 159 — 159 154 — 154 106 — 106 Total operating expenses $ 60,417 $ (833 ) $ 59,584 $ 47,215 $ (557 ) $ 46,658 $ 32,798 $ (424 ) $ 32,374 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Fulfillment 40 % 40 % 58 % 58 % 41 % 42 % Marketing 48 47 58 59 51 52 Technology and content 57 58 68 73 40 43 General and administrative 36 36 40 46 44 45 Percent of Net Sales: Fulfillment 10.5 % 10.2 % 9.5 % 9.2 % 8.5 % 8.2 % Marketing 3.9 3.8 3.4 3.3 3.0 2.9 Technology and content 7.5 6.8 6.1 5.4 5.1 4.4 General and administrative 1.5 1.3 1.4 1.2 1.4 1.1 Operating expenses without stock-based compensation are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Item 8 of Part I, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Stock-Based Compensation.” Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products and digital content where we are the seller of record, including Prime Instant Video, inbound and outbound shipping charges, and packaging supplies. Shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2012, 2011, and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product, digital content, and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, as well as from expansion of digital offerings. Consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Gross profit (in millions) $ 15,122 $ 10,789 $ 7,643 Gross margin 24.8 % 22.4 % 22.3 % Gross margin increased in 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. 27 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2012, 2011, and 2010, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We evaluate our facility requirements as necessary. Marketing We direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search, portal advertising, email marketing campaigns, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2012, 2011, and 2010, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels, such as sponsored search programs and our Associates program, payroll and related expenses, and television advertising. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure, including AWS, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories and offerings, so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2012, 2011, and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses, including those associated with our digital initiatives, and increased spending on technology infrastructure, including AWS. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure. For 2012, 2011, and 2010, we capitalized $454 million (including $74 million of stock-based compensation), $307 million (including $51 million of stock-based compensation), and $213 million (including 28 Table of Contents $38 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $327 million, $236 million, and $184 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010. A majority of our technology costs are incurred in the U.S., most of which are allocated to our North America segment. Infrastructure, other technology, and operating costs incurred to support AWS are included in technology and content. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2012, 2011, and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation was $833 million, $557 million, and $424 million during 2012, 2011, and 2010. The increase in 2012, 2011, and 2010 compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in total stock-based compensation value granted to our employees and to a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $159 million, $154 million, and $106 million during 2012, 2011, and 2010. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, the amounts primarily related to amortization of intangible assets. Income from Operations For the reasons discussed above, income from operations decreased 22% in 2012, decreased 39% in 2011, and increased 25% in 2010. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $40 million, $61 million, and $51 million during 2012, 2011, and 2010. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. The primary component of our interest expense is related to our long-term debt and capital and financing lease arrangements. Interest expense was $92 million, $65 million, and $39 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our long-term debt was $3.1 billion and $255 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our other long-term liabilities were $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Long-Term Debt and Note 7—Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(80) million, $76 million, and $79 million during 2012, 2011, and 2010. The primary component of other income (expense), net, is related to foreign-currency gains (losses) on intercompany balances. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $428 million, $291 million, and $352 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our effective tax rate in 2012, 2011, and 2010 is significantly affected by two factors: the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit. Income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg. Losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily generated by subsidiaries located outside of Europe, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets. In 2012, the adverse impact of such foreign jurisdiction losses was partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Additionally, our effective tax rate in 2012 was more volatile as compared to prior years due to the lower level of pre-tax income generated during the year, relative to our tax expense. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also adversely impacted by acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit developments, nondeductible expenses, and changes in tax law such as the expiration of the U.S. federal research and development credit at the end of 2011. These items collectively caused our annual effective tax rate to be higher than both the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010. These items may also cause our effective tax rate in 2013 to be higher than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2011 and 2010, the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions offset the adverse impact of foreign jurisdiction losses and, as a result, the effective tax rate in both years was lower than the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2012, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $89 million. We also have approximately $136 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. In January 2013, legislation was enacted to extend the federal research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits through December 31, 2013. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit for the research and development credit and other favorable tax benefits that were extended retroactively to January 1, 2012. 30 Table of Contents Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(155) million, $(12) million, and $7 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010.

(2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of “Free cash flow,” operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation, and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow, which we reconcile to “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website 31 Table of Contents development.” We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt, obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements, or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,180 $ 3,903 $ 3,495 Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development (3,785 ) (1,811 ) (979 ) Free cash flow $ 395 $ 2,092 $ 2,516 Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,595 ) $ (1,930 ) $ (3,360 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 2,259 $ (482 ) $ 181 Operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” line items would be higher. Information regarding the effect of exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. Guidance We provided guidance on January 29, 2013 in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 29, 2013, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2013 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $15.0 billion and $16.6 billion, or to grow between 14% and 26% compared with first quarter 2012. 32 Table of Contents • Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(285) million and $65 million, compared to $192 million in the prior year period. • This guidance includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and it assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions or investments are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our current and long-term cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2012 (in millions, except percentages): 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total EstimatedFair Value atDecember 31,2012 Money market funds $ 5,561 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 5,561 $ 5,561 Weighted average interest rate 0.12 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.12 % Corporate debt securities 223 243 204 27 — — 697 725 Weighted average interest rate 0.45 % 0.62 % 0.84 % 1.25 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.65 % U.S. Government and Agency Securities 771 561 433 20 5 — 1,790 1,810 Weighted average interest rate 0.30 % 0.43 % 0.65 % 1.12 % 1.00 % 0.00 % 0.43 % Asset backed securities 26 16 7 — — — 49 49 Weighted average interest rate 0.48 % 0.69 % 0.67 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.58 % Foreign government and agency securities 141 228 340 30 — — 739 772 Weighted average interest rate 0.18 % 0.10 % 0.12 % 0.06 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.12 % Other securities 8 9 10 5 — — 32 33 Weighted average interest rate 0.88 % 0.68 % 0.80 % 1.08 % 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.83 % $ 6,730 $ 1,057 $ 994 $ 82 $ 5 $ — $ 8,868 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed-income securities $ 8,950 33 Table of Contents At December 31, 2012, we had $3.7 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in three tranches: $750 million of 0.65% notes due in 2015; $1.0 billion of 1.20% notes due in 2017; and $1.3 billion of 2.50% notes due in 2022. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our debt was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2012. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2012, net sales from our International segment accounted for 43% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our international websites, as well as those relating to www.amazon.ca (which is included in our North America segment), are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these websites is the same as the corresponding local currency. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates during 2012, International segment revenues decreased $853 million in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds at December 31, 2012 of $5.1 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% negative currency movement would result in fair value declines of $255 million, $515 million, and $1.0 billion. All investments are classified as “available for sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances at December 31, 2012, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $10 million, $20 million, and $40 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Effect of Exchange Rates,” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in exchange rates. Investment Risk As of December 31, 2012, our recorded basis in equity investments was $140 million. These investments primarily relate to equity and cost method investments in private companies. We review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more difficult due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 34 Table of Contents",2023-12-31 03:11:43.692849
