1059556,MCO,MOODYS CORP /DE/,2003,"Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, commencing at page 26 of this annual report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this Item 3 by reference. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below and in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contingencies”. Moody’s Matters L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this 10 Table of Contents suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions “Common Stock Information” and “Dividends” in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Company’s selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of such data in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moody’s expenses included allocations of costs from Old D&B for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moody’s based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moody’s revenue in proportion to Old D&B’s total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million, $17.2 million, and $16.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moody’s in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity. 11 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, amounts in millions, except per share data 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Results of operations(1) (4) Revenue $ 1,023.3 $ 796.7 $ 602.3 $ 564.2 $ 513.9 Expenses(2) 485.2 398.2 313.8 293.8 288.4 Operating income 538.1 398.5 288.5 270.4 225.5 Non-operating (expense) income, net(3) (20.7 ) (16.6 ) (4.5 ) 8.5 12.4 Income before provision for income taxes 517.4 381.9 284.0 278.9 237.9 Provision for income taxes 228.5 169.7 125.5 123.3 95.9 Net income $ 288.9 $ 212.2 $ 158.5 $ 155.6 $ 142.0 Earnings per share (1) Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.35 $ 0.98 $ 0.96 $ 0.84 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.95 $ 0.83 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 153.9 157.6 161.7 162.3 169.5 Diluted 157.5 160.2 163.0 164.3 171.7 Dividends declared per share $ 0.180 $ 0.180 $ 0.045 $ — $ — As of December 31, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Balance sheet data Total assets $ 630.8 $ 505.4 $ 398.3 $ 274.8 $ 296.2 Long-term debt $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 — — Shareholders’ equity $ (327.0 ) $ (304.1 ) $ (282.5 ) $ (223.1 ) $ (192.6 ) (1) The 1998 data above includes revenue of $18.4 million and operating income of $4.2 million related to the Financial Information Services (“FIS”) business that was sold in July 1998.

These amounts were partially offset by interest income on invested cash of $2.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest expense and income was immaterial in 1999 and 1998. (4) The 2002 results of operations include revenue of $42.1 million, expenses of $42.8 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor-oriented credit research, including in-depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moody’s KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (“KMV”), acquired in April 2002, and Moody’s Risk Management Services. Moody’s KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Factors Affecting Comparability The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies — Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 Distribution”. In general, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement entered into at the Distribution Date, all assets and liabilities of the D&B Business were allocated to New D&B and all assets and liabilities of the Moody’s Business were allocated to Moody’s. The net indebtedness of Old D&B at the Distribution Date was allocated equally between the parties, before giving effect to certain adjustments. The consolidated financial statements of Moody’s Corporation reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Moody’s as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include allocations of certain Old D&B corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from Old D&B at the Distribution Date, as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits, centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by Old D&B for periods prior to the Distribution Date (see Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, for additional information). The expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moody’s revenue in proportion to Old D&B’s total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 13 Table of Contents reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, contingencies, valuation of investments in affiliates, long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future. These judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. Moody’s monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities. In cases where the Company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, deferred revenue included approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively, related to estimated deferred monitoring fees. In addition, Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable included approximately $22 million and $18 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate. In 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Deferred Tax Assets and Undistributed Earnings of Non-U.S. Subsidiaries In assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances, Moody’s considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on these assessments, Moody’s has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets, which totaled $38.6 million at December 31, 2002. However, if Moody’s profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely, the Company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future. In such case, a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made. In addition, the Company has approximately $13 million of undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes have been provided. It is currently management’s intention to permanently re-invest those earnings in the subsidiaries. If management’s approach to re-investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the U.S., incremental expense of approximately $1.2 million for U.S. federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 14 Table of Contents Investments in Affiliates, Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Moody’s assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. These evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the Company’s conduct of its operations, and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results. If actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the Company’s judgments, impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets. Based on its assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $3.4 million (pre-tax) to write-down a portion of its equity investment in two Argentine rating agencies. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Moody’s employee pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, health care cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. Following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the Company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefits. • Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long-term bonds. • Salary growth assumptions are based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook. • Health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. • Long-term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments), over a long-term horizon. In 2003, for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense, the Company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately 8.5%, which reflects return assumptions of approximately 9.5% for equity investments and approximately 5.1% for fixed-income investments. The 2003 return assumption was reduced from 9.75% in 2002, principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness. This change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2003. Stock-Based Compensation In 2002 and prior years, the Company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options, and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements. The stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. However, circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123”. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 will be expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. In addition, shares issued to participants in the Company’s employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the Company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance. Using what the Company believes are reasonable assumptions and the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the estimated impact of this change will be approximately $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. In future years, as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle (currently four years), the Company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater. The Company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises, which will be an important use of its cash flow over time. During 2002, approximately $38 million was spent on such repurchases (after option 15 Table of Contents proceeds and related tax benefits), which was approximately 13% of the Company’s after-tax cash flow before dividends, share repurchases and the KMV acquisition. The Company’s 2001 spending was approximately $24 million, which was approximately 9% of after-tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases. Operating Segments The Company has historically operated in one reportable business segment – Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Company’s total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV, Moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moody’s KMV segment is referred to as Moody’s Risk Management Services (“MRMS”), the predecessor business. The Moody’s Investors Service business consists of four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed-income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moody’s KMV segment. The Moody’s KMV business consists of KMV, acquired in April 2002, and Moody’s Risk Management Services. Moody’s KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. Excluding post-acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, Moody’s achieved revenue growth of 23.2% over the prior year. The Company’s revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business with global structured finance the largest growth driver, as well as strong double-digit growth in the global research business. Revenue in the United States was $680.3 million in 2002, an increase of $119.6 million or 21.3% from $560.7 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $19.0 million, U.S. revenue increased 17.9% to $661.3 million. Strong growth in U.S. ratings revenue reflected higher issuance volumes in several market sectors, particularly structured finance and municipal bonds. Moody’s international revenue was $343.0 million in 2002, an increase of 45.3% from $236.0 million in 2001. Excluding KMV revenue of $23.1 million, international revenue increased 35.6% to $319.9 million. This increase was primarily driven by strong growth in revenue from structured finance ratings in Europe and Japan, and global financial institutions. International research revenue grew 36% over 2001, and the consolidation of Korea Investors Service commencing in January 2002 also contributed to 2002 revenue growth. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 34% of total Moody’s revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. Excluding $12.2 million related to KMV, operating expenses would have been $273.1 million in 2002, a 14.0% year-over-year increase. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. Included in 2002 expenses are the following charges relating to Moody’s KMV: $2.9 million of acquisition related charges, primarily for write-offs of software and in-process research and development; $1.6 million related to management transition; and $1.5 million related to the settlement of a patent licensing matter. 2002 and 2001 expense each included approximately $6.0 million of charitable contributions, mainly to The Moody’s Foundation. Excluding these items and excluding all other expenses of KMV (totaling $19.7 16 Table of Contents million), SG&A expenses increased 5.9% to $143.6 million in 2002, from $135.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, higher professional fees primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems, and higher legal fees due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. In addition, occupancy and travel related costs increased as a result of business expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The 2002 expense reflected $7.5 million of KMV-related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Excluding these items, depreciation and amortization increased by $2.2 million or 14.8% year-to-year. Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moody’s operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Company’s high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non-operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amounts primarily reflected interest expense of $22.8 million in each year, related to Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt and interest income of $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. The Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease in the future as a greater portion of Moody’s business migrates to lower tax jurisdictions. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Moody’s Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $381.2 million in 2002, an increase of $107.4 million or 39.2% from $273.8 million in 2001. Strong growth was achieved in several U.S. market sectors, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, credit derivatives and asset-backed securities. International structured finance revenue grew close to 60% versus 2001, reflecting strength in Europe, especially in credit derivatives and Japan, principally in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $228.4 million in 2002, up 1.2% from $225.7 million in 2001. The number of issues in the U.S. corporate market declined about 17% in 2002 compared with the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. The effect of this decline on overall corporate finance revenue was tempered, however, by growth in bank loan ratings and relationship-based revenue. European corporate finance generated double-digit revenue growth versus the prior year despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship-based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service also contributed to revenue growth over the prior year. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $157.4 million in 2002, an increase of $26.7 million or 20.4% from $130.7 million in 2001. This reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in the U.S. in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short-term debt to long-term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Growth in issuer ratings and other relationship-based revenue also contributed to the year-over-year growth. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year-to-year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance was strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay-as-you-go financing by municipal borrowers. 17 Table of Contents Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moody’s information to third-party distributors contributed to the growth. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses were, $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million, or 9.3% over 2001. This increase was principally due to higher compensation and related costs to support business expansion, primarily in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other operating expense increases included consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products, due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Included in 2001expenses was a $3.4 million write-down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. Excluding post-acquisition revenue from KMV of $42.1 million, revenue for the prior Moody’s Risk Management Services business grew 27.9% to $39.4 million in 2002. The revenue growth principally reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc™ credit assessment products as more country-specific models have been introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moody’s KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $6.0 million of acquisition related, management transition and patent licensing charges described in “Total Company Results” above, and excluding all other KMV expenses of $31.9 million, expenses would have been $37.0 million in 2002, a 30.7% year-over-year increase. This increase primarily reflected higher compensation and benefit costs to support business expansion and increased consulting costs related to new product development. Moody’s KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year-to-year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets partially offset by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill from a prior acquisition pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Moody’s KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million of expenses, and $6.3 million of amortization expense related to the KMV acquisition, the Moody’s KMV segment would have reported operating income of $7.0 million. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Total Company Results Total Moody’s revenue was $796.7 million in 2001, an increase of $194.4 million or 32.3% from $602.3 million in 2000. The Company’s 2001 revenue performance reflected strong growth in revenue across all ratings groups as well as in global research and Moody’s Risk Management Services. Revenue in the United States was $560.7 million in 2001, an increase of $131.8 million or 30.7% from $428.9 million in 2000. This increase reflected strong growth in ratings revenue, principally due to higher issuance volumes in most market sectors, including investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. Moody’s international revenue was $236.0 million in 2001, an increase of 36.1% over $173.4 million in 2000. European structured finance revenue almost doubled for the year. International corporate finance revenue grew more than 20% and financial institutions revenue showed solid double-digit growth. International revenue at Moody’s Risk Management Services rose 46.1% and non-U.S. research revenue grew 23.7%. 18 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $239.6 million in 2001 grew 26.4% from $189.6 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in the worldwide structured finance business, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Company’s very strong 2001 results. Also included in operating expense was a $3.4 million charge to write-down investments in two Argentine rating agencies, due to the currency devaluation and unstable economic and political situation. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.6 million in 2001 were up 31.6% compared to $107.6 million in 2000. This increase principally reflected higher incentive compensation costs due to the Company’s very strong 2001 results; costs of approximately $5.0 million for severance, legal fees and other expenses related to the Company’s legal settlement with the Department of Justice in April 2001; and $6.0 million related to charitable contributions and initial funding for the newly-formed Moody’s Foundation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $16.6 million in 2000 to $17.0 million in 2001. Operating income of $398.5 million in 2001 was up 38.1% from $288.5 million in 2000. Moody’s operating margin for 2001 was 50.0%, up from 47.9% in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Interest and other non-operating expense was $16.6 million in 2001 compared with $4.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2001was principally the result of a full year of interest expense related to the Company’s $300 million private debt placement that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2000, offset in part by interest income on invested cash. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.4% in 2001 compared to 44.2% in 2000. Net income was $212.2 million in 2001 compared with $158.5 million in 2000. Earnings per share were $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001, compared with $0.98 basic and $0.97 diluted in 2000. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Moody’s Investors Service revenue was $765.9 million in 2001, up 32.2% from $579.3 million in 2000. Strong double-digit growth in global structured finance, European and U.S. corporate finance, public finance and global research drove much of the increase. Structured finance ratings revenue of $273.8 million in 2001 grew 37.4% over 2000 revenue of $199.2 million. The increase was due to strong growth in the U.S. across several market sectors including credit derivatives, asset-backed securities and both commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed issuance volume was up 29%, residential mortgage volume rose 130% and commercial mortgage volume was up 50%. European structured finance growth was very strong primarily due to credit derivatives, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Revenue from corporate finance ratings was $225.7 million in 2001 compared with $162.7 million in 2000, an increase of 38.7%. Lower interest rates in the U.S. resulted in strong issuance growth in both investment grade and high yield bonds, with robust refinancing activity. The number of investment grade corporate issues was up more than 48% over 2000. Also contributing to revenue growth was Moody’s Rating Assessment Service, which was introduced in the second half of 2000. In addition, new monitoring fees for infrequent issuers were initiated in 2001, which produced approximately $9.0 million of revenue growth over 2000. Revenue from financial institutions and sovereign risk ratings was $130.7 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1% over $111.6 million in 2000. Lower interest rates in the U.S. drove increased investment grade issuance for banks and other financial institutions. In addition, revenue in Europe grew at a double-digit pace due to lower borrowing costs. Public finance ratings revenue grew 39.3% to $64.2 million in 2001, up from $46.1 million in 2000. This was primarily due to a 43% increase in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bonds issued in 2001 compared to 2000. Refinancing activity was especially strong due to the favorable interest rate environment, and represented 31% of total issuance dollar volume in 2001 versus 17% in 2000. Research revenue increased 19.8%, to $71.5 million, reflecting continued international expansion, new product introductions and growth in demand for products delivered via the Internet. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $352.9 million in 2001, an increase of $80.5 million, or 29.6% from $272.4 million in 2000. Of this increase, $14.4 million was due to the Argentine investment write-down, the Company’s legal settlement with the Department of Justice, and charitable expenses, all as described above. The remaining increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of analysts, particularly in Europe and in 19 Table of Contents global structured finance, as well as higher incentive compensation costs due to the Company’s very strong 2001 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $11.5 million in 2001 versus $11.4 million in 2000. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $401.5 million in 2001 was up 35.9% from $295.5 million in 2000 due to the unexpected strength in revenue throughout the year. Moody’s Risk Management Services Revenue for the Moody’s Risk Management Services business was $30.8 million in 2001, an increase of 33.9% over 2000. This increase was driven by continued strong sales of its credit risk assessment software and subscription products. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Moody’s Risk Management Services were $28.3 million in 2001 compared with $24.8 million in 2000. The increase reflected higher compensation and related expenses and increased professional fees to support product development. Depreciation and amortization expense was $5.5 million in 2001 versus $5.2 million in 2000. Moody’s Risk Management Services reported an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $7.0 million in 2000. Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 18 countries outside the United States and over 85% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was billed in U.S. dollars. Approximately 30% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $39.9 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $33.1 million was located outside the United States (with $18.0 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short-term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short-term certificates of deposit or issuers of high-grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $334.8 million, $321.4 million, and $70.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase of $13.4 million in 2002 versus 2001 reflected growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Partially offsetting these factors were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million) and an increased investment in accounts receivable reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2002 billings. It is anticipated that the majority of these receivables will be collected in the first quarter of 2003. The strength in 2002 ratings and research business volumes, as well as the acquisition of KMV, also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue over the prior year. The increase in other liabilities in 2002 reflected increased accruals for pension and other post-retirement benefits, and tax exposures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 increased substantially compared with 2000 reflecting, among other things, a $174.6 million payment made to Old D&B in 2000 in connection with the filing of an amended tax return for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods (as further described in Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Contingencies) and year-to-year growth in net 20 Table of Contents income of $53.7 million in 2001. In addition, the 2001 increase reflected the deferral of approximately $50 million of income tax payments noted above. Moody’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2001 were $101.6 million higher than the prior year-end. In addition to the impact of the income tax deferral, the increase reflected higher accruals for incentive compensation, which were paid in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, accounts receivable at year-end 2001 were $47.6 million higher than the prior year-end, reflecting the high level of fourth quarter 2001 billings. Net cash used in investing activities was $223.6 million, $30.0 million and $33.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002, $15.2 million for investments in international rating agencies in 2001 and $17.4 million for the acquisition of a financial software products company in 2000. Capital expenditures, which principally included investments in developing and upgrading computer hardware and software and purchases of office furnishings and equipment, were $18.1 million in 2002, $14.8 million in 2001 and $14.4 million in 2000. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($236.6) million, ($248.1) million and $79.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Share repurchases, employee stock option exercises, dividend payments and debt proceeds and repayments were the principal activities reflected in these amounts. Spending for share repurchases totaled $369.9 million in 2002, $267.6 million in 2001 and $71.8 million in 2000. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $54.0 million in 2002, $47.8 million in 2001 and $10.1 million in 2000. In addition, dividends paid were $27.8 million, $28.3 million and $7.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net proceeds from borrowings totaled $107.1 million in 2002 (as described below) and $104.5 million in 2000 representing net proceeds from the $300 million long-term financing that was put in place at the time of the Company’s spin-off from Old D&B, as described below. In addition, cash flow from financing activities in 2000 reflected cash distributions made to Old D&B through the Distribution Date. During 2002, Moody’s funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. Moody’s has since borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short-term borrowing costs. Management is considering pursuing long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2002, Moody’s had $107.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities, in addition to the $300 million of long-term financing. Indebtedness In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moody’s was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moody’s funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the “Notes”) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi-annually. In the event that Moody’s pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the “prepaid principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) consists of an $80 million 5-year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364-day facility that expires in September 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $76.1 million under the 5-year facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.64% per annum, and $31.0 million under the 364-day facility, bearing interest at approximately 1.73% per annum. Interest on borrowings under the 5-year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2002, such premium was 22 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364-day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5-year facility can range from 7 basis points to 12.5 basis points depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2002. The annual fees for the 364-day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility. In April 2002, Moody’s used the Facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the KMV acquisition; amounts outstanding under the Facility were repaid in the second quarter of 2002. Since that time, Moody’s has borrowed under the Facility to fund share repurchases 21 Table of Contents as noted above. Interest incurred under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $0.3 million, $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moody’s completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which Moody’s expects to complete by mid-2004. The program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moody’s common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Company’s employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Moody’s repurchased 8.2 million shares at a total cost of $369.9 million, including 2.7 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2002, Moody’s has repurchased 19.5 million shares at a total cost of $709.3 million, including 6.1 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 Total Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years Over 5 Years (in millions) Borrowings under credit facilities $ 107.1 $ 107.1 $ — $ — $ — Notes payable 300.0 — 300.0 — — Operating lease obligations 53.2 13.5 23.1 15.1 1.5 Capital lease obligations 3.7 1.2 2.5 — — Purchase obligations (1) 11.4 6.4 3.8 1.2 — Total $ 475.4 $ 128.2 $ 329.4 $ 16.3 $ 1.5 (1) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back-up facilities, and professional services. 22 Table of Contents Outlook Certain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 31 and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results” following this section. Results of Operations Moody’s results in 2002 and 2001, including growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, have exceeded the Company’s long-term financial targets, which are for low-teens percent growth in Moody’s Investors Service revenue and operating income, with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid-teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share. The Company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets. For the Moody’s KMV business, the Company expects revenue to grow to $200 million by 2005, with an operating margin (before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles) of greater than or equal to 20%. Moody’s is providing its outlook for 2003 at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment, and the timing of such changes, creates important potential variance in the outlook. In Moody’s Investors Service, moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in 2003 is anticipated despite the Company’s expectation of a significant decline in the U.S. housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings, and lower growth in U.S. consumer spending affecting asset-backed issuance. In global corporate finance, the Company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in 2003 despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the U.S. In the U.S. public finance sector, issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak. Nevertheless, because of an expected decline in refinancing activity, the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in 2003. Moody’s also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business. Finally, healthy growth in the Moody’s KMV business is expected. Moody’s expenses for 2003 will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices, technology initiatives, product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. Moody’s expects a slight decline in the operating margin in 2003 compared to the very high margin level in 2002, before the impact of expensing stock options (which is discussed elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis). Overall for 2003, Moody’s expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid-to-high single digits. With the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits, before the approximate $0.04 per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate $0.05 per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy (which is discussed in Note 17 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Event). The Company’s 2003 outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the United States, including the recently-published SEC report on rating agencies pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is discussed elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Based on management’s current assessment, Moody’s does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the Company’s 2003 outlook. However, changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry, possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies, could have an effect in the future. Cash Flow Moody’s believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow, as well as after-tax free cash flow, for fiscal year 2003. The Company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company’s approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends. Should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax-efficient, the Company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies. In addition, as described above, the Company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during 2002 to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the KMV acquisition and share repurchase, and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. 23 Table of Contents In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2003, to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis under “Contingencies”. These potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 83% of Moody’s revenue in 2002 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit-sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moody’s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2002 that was substantially greater than its historical averages, principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain U.S. sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers’ ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which Moody’s provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moody’s business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share through Competition The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moody’s faces increasing competition from S&P, Fitch, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, Ltd. (“DBRS”) are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets, the SEC has indicated that it is exploring whether (i) there are viable alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations and (ii) whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition. The recognition of DBRS as a NRSRO occurred in February 2003, after the release of the SEC’s report. Elimination of the NRSRO concept or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share for Moody’s. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 24 Table of Contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost-effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions Moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government-Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected. Government-mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued a report that recommended changes in SEC regulation of rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considers a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC-initiated review of credit rating agencies. In the report, the SEC stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early 2003 to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the SEC’s ongoing review. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commission’s Market Abuse Directive are applicable to many participants in the European capital markets, including credit rating agencies. Depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted, such implementation guidelines may increase Moody’s cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 25 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: • changes in legal and regulatory requirements • possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions • restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars • currency fluctuations • export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers • difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel • longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables • political and economic instability • potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old D&B, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (“Legacy Contingencies”) and those that relate to Moody’s business and operations (“Moody’s Matters”). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moody’s and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”) and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”) (the “1996 Distribution”). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (“Donnelley”) (the “1998 Distribution”). During 1998, Cognizant through a 26 Table of Contents spin-off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). In September 2000, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s, as further described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws, including purported violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (“SRG”). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRI’s complaint alleges damages in excess of $350 million, which amount IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. Discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, Cognizant, ACNielsen and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement”) pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities (“IRI Liabilities”) that may arise out of or in connection with the IRI action and (ii) to conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities, if any, become payable (the “ACN Maximum Amount”), and that The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to (i) any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims-paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firm’s ability to deliver a viability opinion (but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval), and (ii) payment of related fees and expenses. For these purposes, financial viability means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such plan, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such plan, for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen merged with VNU N.V. Pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount, and VNU assumed ACNielsen’s liabilities under that agreement. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B and Donnelley entered into an agreement (the “1998 Distribution Agreement”) whereby Old D&B assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In 1999, NMR was acquired by VNU N.V. and VNU assumed NMR’s liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New D&B undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. However, as between themselves, each of New D&B and Moody’s will be responsible for 50% of any payments to be made with respect to the IRI action pursuant to the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related thereto. Management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the IRI action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect Moody’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. 27 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and New D&B and Moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as “Amortization Expense Deductions” for which New D&B and Moody’s are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New D&B and/or Moody’s pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “Utilization of Capital Losses”. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2002, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Notice, the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the IRS. In addition, the IRS recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notice (and including penalties), and were to prevail in its position, then New D&B would be required to pay the assessment. If New D&B were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. The Company estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $55 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, New D&B has received a Preliminary Summary Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for 1996. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Report and were to prevail in this matter, then New D&B would be required to pay the assessment. If New D&B were to challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court rather than in U.S. Tax Court, then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Moody’s estimates that its share of the exposure to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $46 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph. Amortization Expense Deductions The IRS has requested from New D&B documentation with respect to a transaction executed in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. It is possible that the IRS could ultimately challenge these deductions and that New D&B could make payments to the IRS related to previously claimed deductions. In that event, Moody’s would be required to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&B’s payments to the IRS. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moody’s at the Distribution Date. Management estimates that the Company’s current potential exposure related to this matter is $89 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take with respect to assessments and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old D&B 28 Table of Contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moody’s and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old D&B that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New D&B is contesting the IRS’ assessment. New D&B has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moody’s does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moody’s estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the “IMS/NMR Agreement”). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old D&B in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old D&B. Neither Old D&B nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. A decision from the arbitration panel is expected in 2003. If NMR should prevail in the arbitration against IMS Health and, in turn, IMS Health should prevail against Old D&B, then the Company believes that the additional liability of Old D&B would be approximately $15 million, net of tax benefits. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moody’s and New D&B would each be responsible for one-half of such amount, or approximately $7.5 million. The Company believes that the claim asserted against Old D&B by IMS Health is without merit. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements. Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters. However, it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, which could result in material charges to Moody’s future reported results. In addition, the cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $202 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moody’s Matters L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2002) plus legal costs. Moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. Dividends Since the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company has paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in 2002 and 2001, and 4.5 cents in 2000. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2000, when Moody’s was a subsidiary of Old D&B, the Company did not pay dividends directly to Old D&B shareholders. 29 Table of Contents In December 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2003 dividend of 4.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2003. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moody’s going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moody’s Board of Directors. Common Stock Information As described above in “Item 1—Business—Background”, the 2000 Distribution was completed on September 30, 2000. As of October 3, 2000 the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MCO”. The table below indicates the high and low sales price of the Company’s common stock and the dividends paid for the periods shown. The number of registered shareholders of record at January 31, 2003 was 5,073. Price Per Share Dividends Paid High Low Per Share From October 3, 2000 through December 31, 2000 $ 28.88 $ 22.63 $ 0.045 2001: First quarter $ 29.11 $ 25.49 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 34.85 $ 26.17 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 37.00 $ 30.60 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 41.10 $ 31.46 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 41.10 $ 25.49 $ 0.180 2002: First quarter $ 42.00 $ 35.80 $ 0.045 Second quarter $ 51.74 $ 39.94 $ 0.045 Third quarter $ 52.40 $ 41.00 $ 0.045 Fourth quarter $ 50.48 $ 39.80 $ 0.045 Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 52.40 $ 35.80 $ 0.180 Fees of Independent Accountants Audit Fees The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and for the review of the financial statements included in the Company’s Reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, and for statutory audits of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $0.9 million (including $0.3 million incurred but not billed in 2002) and $0.6 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Audit-Related Fees The aggregate fees billed for audit-related services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Such services included acquisition due diligence reviews and related audits, employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. Tax Fees The aggregate fees billed for tax services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.6 million and $2.4 million (including $0.2 million incurred but not billed in 2001), respectively. Tax services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP principally related to expatriate tax services and tax consulting and compliance. Fees for tax consulting and compliance in 2001 principally were in connection with Moody’s transition to an independent company after its spin-off from Old D&B. All Other Fees The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such fees principally related to data 30 Table of Contents entry services provided to the Company’s ratings business. The Company does not anticipate that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will provide any future services in this area. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for Moody’s business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Those statements appear in the section entitled “Outlook” under Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” commencing at page 13 of this annual report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in the context of statements containing the words “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates” and other words relating to Moody’s views on future events, trends and contingencies. The forward-looking statements and other information are made as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. Those factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets; changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets; possible loss of market share through competition; introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressures from competitors and/or customers; the potential emergence of government-sponsored credit rating agencies; proposed U.S., foreign, state and local legislation and regulations, including those relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; the possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures; the outcome of any review by controlling tax authorities of the Company’s global tax planning initiatives; the outcome of those tax and legal contingencies that relate to Old D&B, its predecessors and their affiliated companies for which the Company has assumed portions of the financial responsibility; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate the KMV and MRMS businesses; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions. These factors and other risks and uncertainties that could cause Moody’s actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results” and in other reports of the Company filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information in response to this Item is set forth under the caption “Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K.",2023-12-30 20:56:49.467550
1059556,MCO,MOODYS CORP /DE/,2004,"Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, commencing at page 30 of this annual report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this Item 3 by reference. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below and in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contingencies”. L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS Information in response to this Item is set forth under the captions “Common Stock Information” and “Dividends” in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 12 Table of Contents ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The Company’s selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented as if the Company were a separate entity for all periods presented. Through September 30, 2000, the Distribution Date, Moody’s expenses included allocations of costs from Old D&B for employee benefits, centralized services and other corporate overhead. Expenses related to these services were allocated to Moody’s based on utilization of specific services or, where such an estimate could not be determined, based on Moody’s revenue in proportion to Old D&B’s total revenue. Although management believes these expense allocations are reasonable, they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity. The allocations included in expenses in the consolidated statements of operations were $13.3 million in 2000 and $17.2 million in 1999. There were no such allocations subsequent to the Distribution Date. The financial data included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position of Moody’s in the future or what they would have been had it been a separate entity.

Interest expense was immaterial in 1999. The 2003 amount also includes a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Certain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 37 and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results” on page 27. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs, as well as rating opinions on issuers of credit obligations. It also publishes investor-oriented credit research, including in-depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moody’s KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (“KMV”), acquired in April 2002, and Moody’s Risk Management Services. Moody’s KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies — Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 Distribution”. Critical Accounting Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such 14 Table of Contents cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, deferred revenue included approximately $26 million and $20 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included approximately $26 million and $22 million, respectively, of accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above-noted factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moody’s estimates. In each of 2003 and 2002, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this management’s discussion and analysis, requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected an increase of $16.2 million in reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under “Legacy Tax Matters” below. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. Goodwill Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Moody’s goodwill balance is material ($126.4 million at December 31, 2003), and the evaluation of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from 15 Table of Contents the Company’s judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moody’s reports for pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: • Future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook. • Discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long-term bonds. • Long-term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments). In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point increase in each of these assumptions would have had on Moody’s pre-tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Pre- Assumption Used for tax Expense in 2003 2003 (decrease)/increase Discount Rate 6.75 % ($ 2.5 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 3.91 % $ 1.0 Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.10 % ($ 1.0 ) Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123”. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. 16 Table of Contents An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on pre-tax expense in 2003 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for Amount of Increase in Pre-tax Expense in 2003 2003 Assumption (decrease)/increase Expected Dividend Yield 0.41 % 0.10 % ($ 0.1 ) Expected Share Price Volatility 30 % 5 % $ 1.2 Expected Option Holding Period 5.0 years 1.0 year $ 1.1 Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long-lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moody’s. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment – Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Company’s total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moody’s Risk Management Services to form Moody’s KMV, Moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In discussing periods prior to 2002, the Moody’s KMV segment is referred to as Moody’s Risk Management Services (“MRMS”), the predecessor business. In order to provide additional information relating to Moody’s operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moody’s Investors Service business consists of four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed-income instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moody’s KMV segment. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moody’s pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year-to-year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. Moody’s strong revenue growth was achieved despite expectations early in the year that the Company would encounter a difficult macroeconomic and capital markets environment. The Company benefited from better-than-expected revenue in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage-backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moody’s research business produced very strong results and Moody’s KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 200 basis points of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year-to-year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moody’s Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moody’s international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year-to-year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moody’s total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. Overall, Moody’s expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately two-thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moody’s increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2003 compared with year-end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moody’s KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year-to-year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moody’s enhanced analysis initiative, and MKMV. The year-to-year operating expense increase also reflected $8 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SG&A expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year-to-year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year-to-year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million and higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. 18 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year-to-year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 150 basis points of reported operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moody’s Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moody’s KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moody’s Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.5 million related to stock-based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non-operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters, below). This item accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately 225 basis points of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid-teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Refinancing activity has slowed significantly in recent months, and Moody’s expects a decline in this sector in 2004 as discussed below. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year-to-year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year-to-year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year-to-year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year-to-year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year-to-year although dollar issuance 19 Table of Contents declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship-based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year-to-year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% due primarily to refinancing activity, as spreads tightened and new issuers accessed the market. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year-to-year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year-to-year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year period. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short-term notes declined year-to-year. Refinancings represented 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Moody’s expects that public finance issuance and revenue will decline in 2004, as discussed below. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by growth in licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moody’s enhanced analysis initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year-to-year due to lower growth in the Company’s operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year-to-year expense increases included: $9 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation (mainly for options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year-to-year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moody’s KMV The following table shows Moody’s KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the “reported comparisons”), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the “pro forma comparisons”), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 20 Table of Contents MKMV’s pro forma year-to-year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit decisioning software grew $2 million year-to-year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year to year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003 whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year-to-year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2001 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2002 was $1,023.3 million, an increase of $226.6 million or 28.4% from $796.7 million in the prior year. The Company’s revenue performance reflected strong gains in a number of sectors of the ratings business, with global structured finance contributing nearly half of the year-to-year growth. MKMV accounted for $50.7 million of year-to-year growth, including $42.1 million of revenue from the April 2002 acquisition of KMV. Revenue in the United States was $680.8 million in 2002, an increase of $120.1 million or 21.4% from $560.7 million in 2001. The 2002 increase reflected $85 million of growth in ratings revenue, with higher issuance volumes in several market sectors due to the favorable interest rate environment. Structured finance contributed $66 million of the U.S. ratings revenue growth, with the residential mortgage sector increasing approximately $29 million and other sectors contributing to growth as well. MKMV contributed $23 million of growth, including $19 million of post-acquisition revenue from KMV. Moody’s international revenue was $342.5 million in 2002, an increase of 45.1% from $236.0 million in 2001. International growth was primarily driven by structured finance, with European structured finance growing by over $30 million. MKMV contributed $28 million of growth, including $23 million of post-acquisition revenue from KMV. In 2002, international revenue accounted for 33% of total Moody’s revenue, up from 30% in 2001. Operating expenses of $285.3 million in 2002 grew $45.7 million or 19.1% from $239.6 million in 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $26 million year-to-year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. In addition, the April 2002 acquisition of KMV resulted in an increase in operating expenses of $12.2 million compared with the prior year. Operating expense increases also included consulting costs to support new product development, and higher occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $175.3 million in 2002 were up $33.7 million or 23.8% versus $141.6 million in 2001. This increase was principally due to $23.1 million of expenses related to KMV, which was acquired in April 2002. Other increases included higher compensation and benefits of $3 million to support business expansion; higher professional fees of $4 million primarily for technology infrastructure and financial systems; and higher legal fees of $3 million primarily due to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $24.6 million in 2002 from $17.0 million in 2001. The increase was principally due to $7.5 million of KMV-related expenses, including $6.3 million for amortization of acquired software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $2.1 million for amortization of goodwill, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. 21 Table of Contents Operating income of $538.1 million in 2002 was up 35.0% from $398.5 million in 2001. Moody’s operating margin for 2002 was 52.6%, up from 50.0% in 2001. The strong operating income growth in 2002 principally reflected the Company’s high revenue growth without a proportional increase in expenses. Interest and other non-operating expense was $20.7 million in 2002 compared with $16.6 million in 2001. The amount in each year included interest expense of $22.8 million related to Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $2.3 million in 2002 compared with $6.5 million in 2001. The lower interest income in 2002 was principally due to lower interest rates, and the use of cash on hand to fund the KMV acquisition and greater share repurchases. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.2% in 2002 compared to 44.4% in 2001. Net income was $288.9 million in 2002 compared with $212.2 million in 2001. Earnings per share were $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002, compared with $1.35 basic and $1.32 diluted in 2001. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Moody’s Investors Service revenue was $941.8 million in 2002, up 23.0% from $765.9 million in 2001. The increase was principally driven by strong growth in global structured finance, financial institutions and research revenue, as well as in U.S. public finance. Structured finance revenue was $384.3 million in 2002, an increase of $110.5 million or 40.4% from $273.8 million in 2001. The U.S. structured finance business accounted for $66 million of this growth, with nearly $29 million of growth in the residential mortgage sector and over $10 million of growth in revenue from credit derivatives. The largest component of international structured finance revenue growth was Europe, with a year-to-year increase of over $30 million. The credit derivatives sector was the largest growth driver in Europe. Structured finance revenue in Japan grew approximately $7 million year-to-year, principally in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Corporate finance revenue was $227.7 million in 2002, up 0.9% from $225.7 million in 2001. U.S. corporate finance revenue declined $9 million year-to-year. This reflected a year-to-year decline of 17% in the number of issues, with weakness in corporate investment spending, lower merger and acquisition activity and slower refinancing activity. Price increases and growth in relationship-based revenue partially offset the impact of this decline. European corporate finance contributed approximately $4 million of revenue growth in 2002 despite lower issuance volumes, primarily due to new rating customers and growth in relationship-based revenue. The consolidation of Korea Investors Service starting in January 2002 added approximately $5 million of year-to-year revenue growth. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk sector was $155.0 million in 2002, an increase of $24.3 million or 18.6% from $130.7 million in 2001. In the U.S., growth of $11 million reflected a 6% increase in the number of financial institutions issues in 2002 compared to 2001, due to refinancing of short-term debt to long-term debt and increased investor demand for issues in this sector. In Europe, revenue increased $8 million as the number of transactions in this sector was up 17% from the prior year. Public finance revenue increased 26.5% to $81.2 million in 2002, from $64.2 million in 2001. Year-to-year growth of 25% in the dollar volume of U.S. municipal bond issuance was the main driver of this performance. Issuance volumes were strong for both new issues and refinancings, reflecting the favorable interest rate environment as well as less pay-as-you-go financing by municipal borrowers. Research revenue grew 30.9% to $93.6 million in 2002, up from $71.5 million in 2001. Revenue in the United States grew $12 million year-to-year, and international revenue increased $10 million, mainly in Europe. Increased investor focus on credit risk helped to drive higher sales of products to current customers and the addition of new customers. In addition, increased revenue from licensing Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution contributed to the growth. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $385.7 million in 2002, an increase of $32.8 million or 9.3% over 2001. The largest driver of the increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew by $24 million year-to-year. This reflected compensation increases, higher benefits expenses, and increases in staffing. Staffing increases principally occurred to support business expansion in Europe and the global structured finance business. Other 22 Table of Contents expense increases included $4 million for consulting costs related to investments in technology infrastructure and financial systems, $3 million for legal fees related to U.S. and European regulatory inquiries and higher rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Included in 2001 expenses was a $3.4 million write-down of investments in two Argentine rating agencies due to the currency devaluation and the unstable economic and political situation. The expense increases were partially offset by lower costs for production and delivery of research products due to the continued shift to Internet delivery. Depreciation and amortization expense was $12.7 million in 2002 versus $11.5 million in 2001. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $543.4 million in 2002 was up 35.3% from $401.5 million in 2001. Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV reported revenue of $81.5 million in 2002 compared to $30.8 million in 2001. The April 2002 acquisition of KMV accounted for $42.1 million of the year-to-year revenue growth. The remaining $8.6 million of revenue growth reflected increased subscriptions for RiskCalc™ credit assessment products as additional country-specific models were introduced, and license fees for new sales and upgrades of credit decisioning software. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of Moody’s KMV were $74.9 million in 2002 compared with $28.3 million in 2001, an increase of $46.6 million. Post-acquisition operating expenses of KMV accounted for $35.3 million of the year-to-year expense growth. The remaining increase principally reflected growth of $5 million in compensation and benefit costs to support growth in the legacy MRMS business, and higher consulting costs related to new product development. Moody’s KMV depreciation and amortization expense was $11.9 million in 2002 versus $5.5 million in 2001; the year-to-year increase primarily reflected $6.3 million of amortization expense related to acquired KMV software and intangible assets. The 2001 amount included $1.5 million of goodwill amortization, which was discontinued in 2002 with the implementation of SFAS No. 142. Moody’s KMV reported an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $3.0 million in 2001. Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2003, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 10% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $269.1 million at December 31, 2003, approximately $56.8 million was located outside the United States (with $35.5 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short-term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short-term certificates of deposit or issuers of high-grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Overview Cash and cash equivalents increased $229.2 million during 2003, to $269.1 million. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, and proceeds from stock plans were $79.0 million. Significant uses of this cash flow were $171.7 million for share repurchases, $107.1 million for the repayment of short-term bank debt outstanding at year-end 2002, dividend payments of $26.8 million and capital expenditures of $17.9 million. Cash Flow Analysis The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $468.4 million, $334.8 million and $321.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year-to-year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year-over-year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. In addition, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, increases in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year-to-year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moody’s investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year-to-year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year-to-year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 increased by $13.4 million compared with 2001, in part reflecting growth in net income of $76.7 million and increased tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of $12.4 million. Partially offsetting these impacts were the payment of approximately $50 million of U.S. federal income taxes related to 2001 that were deferred into 2002 as a result of the September 11th tragedy, and higher payments for prior year incentive compensation (approximately $38 million). The increase in other liabilities in 2002 included increased reserves related to pension and other post-retirement benefits. Net cash used in investing activities was $17.1 million, $223.6 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments in affiliates. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Company’s ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002 and $9.6 million for Korea Investors Service during 2001. The Company made investments in international rating agencies totaling $5.6 million in 2001. Cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and the capitalization of internally developed software costs totaled $17.9 million, $18.1 million and $14.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $227.7 million, $236.6 million and $248.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the Company’s bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $171.7 million in 2003, $369.9 million in 2002 and $267.6 million in 2001. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from stock plans of $79.0 million in 2003, $54.0 million in 2002 and $47.8 million in 2001. In addition, dividends paid were $26.8 million, $27.8 million and $28.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Moody’s funded the acquisition of KMV with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings from its bank credit facilities, which were subsequently repaid. During 2002, Moody’s also borrowed under its bank credit facilities to fund share repurchases, and the Company has benefited from favorable short-term borrowing costs. Management may consider pursuing long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would 24 Table of Contents result in higher financing costs. At December 31, 2003, Moody’s had no outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facilities and $300 million of long-term financing payable in October 2005. Future Cash Requirements Moody’s currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2004. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use the majority of its cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. The Company also currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. The continued payment of dividends at this rate is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. As described above, the Company has borrowed from time to time under its bank revolving credit facility and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2004, to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies and to satisfy any adverse judgment rendered in the action in France that, in each instance, are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis under “Contingencies”. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding long-term financing of $300 million and a bank revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $107.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The $300 million of long-term financing was secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moody’s was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moody’s funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000, the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the “Notes”) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi-annually. In the event that Moody’s pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity, (the “prepaid principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. The revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) consists of an $80 million 5-year facility that expires in September 2005 and an $80 million 364-day facility that expires in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the 5-year facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a premium that can range from 18 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Earnings Coverage Ratio”), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2003, such premium was 18 basis points. Interest on borrowings under the 364-day facility is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium of 30.5 basis points. The Company also pays annual facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The annual fees for the 5-year facility can range from 7 basis points of the facility amount to 12.5 basis points, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 7 basis points at December 31, 2003. The annual fees for the 364-day facility are 7 basis points. Under each facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds 33% of the facility amount. 25 Table of Contents The Company initially borrowed under the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2002 to fund a portion of the acquisition price for KMV, and subsequently repaid those borrowings. During 2002, Moody’s also borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases, and has benefited from favorable short-term borrowing costs. Interest paid under the Facility for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Management may consider pursuing long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens. The Notes and the Facility also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not less than 3 to 1, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Agreements, of not more than 4 to 1. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. If an event of default were to occur (as defined in the Agreements) and was not remedied by the Company within the stipulated timeframe, an acceleration of the Notes and restrictions on the use of the Facility could occur. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Share Repurchases During October 2002, Moody’s completed the $300 million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2001. On October 22, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $450 million share repurchase program, which includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of Moody’s common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the Company’s employee stock plans. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Moody’s repurchased 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $171.7 million, including 3.2 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Since becoming a public company in September 2000 and through the end of 2003, Moody’s has repurchased 23.0 million shares at a total cost of $881.0 million, including 9.3 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable $ 300.0 $ — $ 300.0 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations 54.5 17.2 21.4 10.8 5.1 Capital lease obligations 2.5 1.2 1.3 — — Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (1) 4.0 — 4.0 — — Purchase obligations (2) 11.3 5.4 4.8 1.1 — Total $ 372.3 $ 23.8 $ 331.5 $ 11.9 $ 5.1 26 Table of Contents (1) This amount reflects Moody’s current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three-year period ending December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back-up facilities, and professional services. Outlook Moody’s outlook for 2004 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, consumer spending, corporate profitability and business investment spending, and capital markets issuance activity. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ significantly from the outlook presented below. The Company expects interest rates in the United States to rise during 2004, with reduced refinancings of debt and continued weak demand for financing to support business investment. As a result, Moody’s expects to see lower issuance in the U.S. corporate bond market, both in the investment grade sector and in the high yield sector, which posted record issuance in 2003. Despite the issuance declines, revenue from new products and growth in relationship-based revenue should produce modest growth in both the U.S. corporate finance and financial institutions sectors. The Company is continuing to introduce the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, consisting of financial reporting, off-balance sheet risk transference and corporate governance assessment reports, and Moody’s plans to cover approximately 350 corporations and financial institutions in North America by the end of 2004. Moody’s also expects good growth in consumer spending in 2004. As a result, the Company expects that growth in revenue from rating asset-backed securitizations, together with moderate growth in the commercial mortgage securitization and credit derivatives segments of the business, will substantially offset an important decline in revenue from rating residential mortgage-backed securities as the very strong refinancing activity of the past two years declines. In the public finance ratings business Moody’s expects a revenue decline of approximately 20% in 2004, reflecting projected slowing of issuance related to both refinancings and “new money” borrowings. The Company expects continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moody’s expects to see double-digit revenue growth in the corporate and financial institutions ratings businesses. The Company is also projecting strong year-over-year growth for structured finance ratings revenue and in the research business, all producing approximately 20% international revenue growth in ratings and research, including the effects of currency translation. Finally, Moody’s expects high teens percent revenue growth globally at Moody’s KMV. Moody’s expenses for 2004 will likely reflect continued investment spending on improving and increasing the transparency of ratings practices, technology initiatives and product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business. The Company will continue investment in the Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Moody’s expects its operating margin to decline about 100 basis points in 2004 from the level achieved in 2003 due to investments being made and the faster growth of the lower margin MKMV business. An additional 100 basis point decline in operating margin is expected due to higher expense for stock-based compensation. Since the Company adopted expensing of stock-based compensation prospectively effective January 1, 2003, the higher expense is due in part to the phasing in of expense over the current four-year option vesting period. Overall for 2004, Moody’s expects that year-over-year revenue growth will be in the mid- to high single digit percent range. With the impact of a slightly lower effective tax rate and share repurchases, the Company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the mid- to high single digit percent range on a reported basis. Reported earnings per share in 2003 included the impacts of the insurance gain, the legacy tax reserve increase and the expensing of stock-based compensation discussed above. The impact of expensing stock-based compensation will also be included in reported earnings per share in 2004, and is expected to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share in 2004 compared with $0.04 per share in 2003. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently 27 Table of Contents known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moody’s revenue in 2003 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit-sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moody’s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in 2003 that was greater than its historical averages, principally due to strong growth in global structured finance and corporate finance issuance volumes, the U.S. components of which were driven by a highly favorable interest rate environment. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moody’s provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on Moody’s business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moody’s faces increasing competition from S&P, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and DBRS are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moody’s, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost-effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality 28 Table of Contents products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions Moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government-Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government-mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Proposed U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the U.S. and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve. Recently there has been discussion in the U.S. regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies. In January 2003, the SEC released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets. The report considered a number of issues that the SEC was required to examine under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other issues arising from a SEC-initiated review of credit rating agencies. In June 2003 the SEC released a Concept Release which posed questions about the continued use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes in federal securities laws, the process for determining rating agencies whose ratings could be so used, and the appropriate level of oversight of such rating agencies. In February 2004, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling on the European Commission to conduct an analysis for registration of rating agencies in Europe and possible registration criteria. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Implementation guidelines proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators under the European Commission’s Market Abuse Directive are applicable to all participants in the European capital markets. Credit rating agencies are excluded from control under the guidelines. However, depending on the form in which the implementation guidelines are ultimately adopted by national regulators or lawmakers, such guidelines could include controls over credit rating agencies in some European Union countries. If so, the guidelines could, among other things, alter rating agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, and increase Moody’s cost of doing business in Europe and the legal risk associated with such business. 29 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: • changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moody’s operations or its customers’ use of ratings • possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions • restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars • currency fluctuations • export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers • difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel • longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables • political and economic instability • potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to Old D&B, its predecessors and their affiliated companies (“Legacy Contingencies”) and those that relate to Moody’s business and operations (“Moody’s Matters”). Legacy Contingencies To understand the Company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moody’s and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”) and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”) (the “1996 Distribution”). 30 Table of Contents In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (“Donnelley”) (the “1998 Distribution”). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). In September 2000, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s, as further described in Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation. Information Resources, Inc. In July 1996, Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (“SRG”). IRI alleges SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRI’s antitrust claims allege that the defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRI’s ability to compete within the U.S. and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti-competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRI’s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRI’s efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI’s complaint originally alleged damages in excess of $350 million, which IRI asked to be trebled under antitrust laws. IRI has since revised its allegation of damages to exceed $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount. In April 2003, the court denied a motion for partial summary judgment by the defendants that sought to dismiss certain of IRI’s claims and granted in part a motion by IRI seeking reconsideration of certain summary judgment rulings the Court had previously made in favor of the defendants. In December of 2003, IRI was acquired by the Gingko Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Symphony Technology II – A. L. P. and certain other parties. As part of that transaction, a statutory trust called the Information Resources, Inc. Litigation Contingent Payment Rights Trust (the “Trust”) was formed. The Trust was created, in part, to issue contingent value rights certificates (“CVRs”), which represent an interest in the IRI lawsuit. The CVRs are governed by a Contingent Value Rights Agreement among IRI and the acquirers, and are a tradeable security listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. As part of the purchase consideration, each IRI stockholder received one CVR for each share of IRI common stock owned, entitling the selling stockholders to a pro rata portion of the proceeds from the IRI lawsuit, if any, allocated to the Trust. The Trust will be entitled to receive an amount equal to 68% of any proceeds from the IRI lawsuit to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than $200 million and 75% of any such proceeds in excess of $200 million. The remaining proceeds, if any, will be the property of IRI. A body consisting of five rights agents was appointed to direct and supervise the IRI Litigation on behalf of IRI and CVR holders. Gingko Corporation named two of the rights agents, IRI named two of the rights agents and these four rights agents selected the fifth “independent” rights agent. Under the Contingent Value Rights Agreement, a majority of the rights agents (other than the independent rights agent) must approve any settlement of the IRI lawsuit. The information contained in this paragraph is solely based on the tender offer statement filed by Gingko Acquisition Corporation and other persons and the registration statement filed by the Trust in connection with the acquisition of IRI. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “Indemnity and Joint Defense 31 Table of Contents Agreement”), pursuant to which they agreed to: • allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (“IRI Liabilities”); and • conduct a joint defense of such action. In particular, the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that: • ACNielsen will assume exclusive liability for IRI Liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable as a result of a final non-appealable judgment or any settlement permitted under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “ACN Maximum Amount”); and • Donnelley and NMR will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. As noted above, ACNielsen is responsible for the IRI Liabilities up to the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that ACNielsen initially is to determine the amount that it will pay at the time of settlement or a final judgment, if any, in IRI’s favor (the “ACN Payment”). The ACN Payment could be less than the ACN Maximum Amount. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides for each of Donnelley and NMR to pay IRI 50% of the difference between the settlement or judgment amount and the ACN Payment, and for ACNielsen to issue a secured note (the “ACN Note”), subject to certain limits, to each of Donnelley and NMR for the amount of their payment. The principal amount of each ACN Note issued to Donnelley and NMR, however, is limited to 50% of the difference between the ACN Maximum Amount and the ACN Payment, and is subject to a further limitation that it cannot exceed 50% of the amount of any proceeds from any recapitalization plan designed to maximize ACNielsen’s claims paying ability. The ACN Notes would become payable upon the completion of any such recapitalization plan. The Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement also provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then NMR and Donnelley shall obtain the bond required for the appeal, and each shall pay 50% of the costs of such bond, if any, which cost will be added to IRI Liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, Moody’s would be responsible for 25% of the total costs of any bond. The ACN Maximum Amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that ACNielsen is able to pay after giving effect to: • any recapitalization plan submitted by such investment bank that is designated to maximize the claims-paying ability of ACNielsen without impairing the investment banking firm’s ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring shareholder approval; and • payment of interest on the ACN Notes and related fees and expenses. For these purposes, “viability” means the ability of ACNielsen, after giving effect to such recapitalization plan, the payment of interest on the ACN Notes, the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the ACN Maximum Amount, to: • pay its debts as they become due; and • finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business, as reconstituted by such recapitalization plan, for two years from the date any such recapitalization plan is expected to be implemented. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V. VNU N.V. assumed ACNielsen’s liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and pursuant to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, VNU N.V. is to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the ACN Maximum Amount. In connection with the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B and Donnelley (then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an agreement (the “1998 Distribution Agreement”) whereby Old D&B assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New D&B undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including any liabilities arising under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New D&B and Moody’s, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New D&B and Moody’s will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution Agreement, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. 32 Table of Contents As a result, the Company will be responsible for the payment of 25% of the portion of any judgment or settlement in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount (as adjusted to include VNU N.V.). New D&B will be responsible for the payment of an additional 25% (together constituting Donnelley’s liability under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement for 50% of such amount) and NMR will be responsible for payment of the remaining 50% of liability in excess of the ACN Maximum Amount. In addition, each of the above parties, in accordance with the foregoing percentages, may be required to advance a portion of the amount, if any, by which the ACN Maximum Amount exceeds the amount of the ACN Payment. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because many of the rights and obligations relating to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of a party to the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to fulfill its obligations could result in the other parties bearing a greater share of the IRI Liabilities. As a result of their 1998 separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement, IMS Health and NMR are each jointly and severally liable for all Cognizant liabilities under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Discovery in the lawsuit is ongoing, and although the court earlier set a trial date for September 2004, the court rescinded that date in January 2004 and there is currently no trial date set. Moody’s is unable to predict at this time the outcome of the IRI action or the financial condition of ACNielsen and VNU N.V. at the time of any such outcome (and hence the Company cannot estimate the amount of the ACN Payment, the ACN Maximum Amount and the portion of any judgment to be paid by VNU N.V. and ACNielsen under the Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement). Therefore, Moody’s is unable to predict at this time whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action or if Moody’s is required to pay or advance a significant portion of any settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and New D&B and Moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters (excluding the matter described below as “Amortization Expense Deductions” for which New D&B and Moody’s are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities after New D&B and/or Moody’s pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “Utilization of Capital Losses”. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS in its Report. During the third quarter of 2003, New D&B filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New D&B could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. 33 Table of Contents Moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $57 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. In a related matter, during the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996. During the third quarter of 2003, the partnership filed a protest with the Appeals Office of the IRS to contest the Examination Report. If the IRS Appeals Office were to uphold the Examination Report, then New D&B could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. Moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS for this matter could be up to approximately $50 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph, and Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, New D&B participated in meetings with the IRS Appeals Office on the two matters described above. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received an Examination Report relating to Old D&B’s participation in the partnership structure for the first quarter of 1997. In this Report the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax return for the 1997 tax year. New D&B also received an Examination Report issued to the partnership with respect to its 1997 tax year. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1997. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS in its Reports and will pursue the same remedies with the same possible consequences described above. Moody’s estimates that its share of the required payment to the IRS in relation to the two Examination Reports could be up to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s believes that the IRS’s proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions During the fourth quarter of 2003, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 that could result in amortization expense deductions from 1997 through 2012. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Notices of Proposed Adjustment. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New D&B could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moody’s at the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that the Company’s current potential exposure related to this matter is $92 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS with respect to the partnership transaction entered into in 1997. In this Notice the IRS proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. In addition, the IRS proposed to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate 34 Table of Contents to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS. If the IRS were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the Notices for 1997 and 1998 or for future years, then New D&B could either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S Court of Federal Claims, where payment of the assessment would be required in connection with such challenge. Should any such payments be made by New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&B’s payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that its share of the potential payment to the IRS could be up to approximately $125 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. Moody’s believes that the IRS’s proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and Old D&B responded by filing a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court on September 21, 2000, after the payments described below were made. The case is expected to go to trial in 2005. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed for the 1989 and 1990 tax periods, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moody’s and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old D&B that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and New D&B is contesting the IRS’ assessment. New D&B has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts, if any, in excess of the amounts paid. With the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence, Moody’s does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to IRS assessments for this matter. If the IRS were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter, Moody’s estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes, penalties and interest (net of tax benefits) on this matter would be approximately $5 million. Subsequent to making its May 2000 payment to the IRS, IMS Health sought partial reimbursement from NMR under their 1998 distribution agreement (the “IMS/NMR Agreement”). NMR paid IMS Health less than the amount sought by IMS Health under the IMS/NMR Agreement and, in 2001, IMS Health filed an arbitration proceeding against NMR to recover the difference. IMS Health sought to include Old D&B in this arbitration, arguing that if NMR should prevail in its interpretation of the IMS/NMR Agreement, then IMS Health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against Old D&B. Neither Old D&B nor any of its predecessors was a party to the IMS/NMR Agreement. On April 29, 2003, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of IMS Health in the arbitration proceeding, awarding IMS Health its full claim plus interest in a decision binding on all parties. As a result, IMS Health’s contingent claim against Old D&B (and consequently Moody’s and New D&B) in connection with this matter has been rendered moot. As no amount with respect to this matter had been accrued by Moody’s, the arbitration panel ruling is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2003, Moody’s had reserves of approximately $126 million with respect to such matters, which reflected an increase of approximately $16 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 relating to the Amortization Expense Deductions matter. Although the matter had previously been under audit, the Company felt that an increase in the related reserve was appropriate since the Notices of Proposed Adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected a formalization by the IRS of its position on the matter. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash 35 Table of Contents flows. Although Moody’s does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential cash outlays resulting from these matters, which the Company currently estimates could be as much as $331 million, could be material and could increase with time as described above. Such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in May 2000 concerning Utilization of Capital Losses. Moody’s Matters L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes On June 20, 2001 a summons was served in an action brought by L’Association Francaise des Porteurs d’ Emprunts Russes (“AFPER”) against Moody’s France SA (a subsidiary of the Company) and filed in the Court of First Instance of Paris, France. In this suit, AFPER, a group of holders of bonds issued by the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, makes claims against Moody’s France SA and Standard & Poor’s SA for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of Russia and Russian debt since 1996. AFPER alleges that, by failing to take into account the post-Revolutionary repudiation of pre-Revolutionary Czarist debt by the Soviet government in rating Russia and new issues of Russian debt beginning in 1996, the rating agencies enabled the Russian Federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the Czarist government. Alleging joint and several liability, AFPER seeks damages of Euro 2.8 billion (approximately U.S. $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2003) plus legal costs. Moody’s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. As such, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the Company. However, if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail, then the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The case has been fully briefed, oral argument was heard before the Court on January 20, 2004, and the Court announced that judgment would be rendered on April 6, 2004. Dividends During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 18.0 cents in each year. In December 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2004 dividend of 7.5 cents per share, payable on March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20, 2004. The payment and level of cash dividends by Moody’s going forward will be subject to the discretion of Moody’s Board of Directors. Common Stock Information The Company’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MCO”.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 41 and “Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results” on page 30 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of credit ratings, research and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets and a provider of quantitative credit assessment services, credit training services and credit process software to banks and other financial institutions. Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor-oriented credit research, including in-depth research on major issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moody’s KMV business consists of the combined businesses of KMV LLC and KMV Corporation (“KMV”), acquired in April 2002, and Moody’s Risk Management Services. Moody’s KMV develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies — Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 Distribution”. Critical Accounting Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 15 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is determined based on annual monitoring fees charged for similar securities or issuers and the level of monitoring effort required for a type of security or issuer. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the frequency of issuance by the issuers and the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from three to ten years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred revenue included approximately $30 million and $26 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding, and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included approximately $29 million and $26 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable balance as a whole, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above-noted factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moody’s estimates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company reduced its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. 16 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes reflected charges of $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, to increase the Company’s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under “Legacy Tax Matters” below. Goodwill Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Moody’s goodwill balance is material ($131.7 million at December 31, 2004), and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Company’s judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moody’s reports for pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: • future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook • discount rates, based on current yields on high grade corporate long-term bonds • long-term return on pension plan assets, based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments) In determining such assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2005 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2005 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post-retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Estimated Impact on Assumption Used for 2005 Operating Income 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate 5.90 % $ (3.9 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 1.2 Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.0 ) 17 Table of Contents Based on our current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post-retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2005 compared with $8 million in 2004. The expected expense increase in 2005 reflects the effects of normal growth in plan liabilities, as well as amortization of actuarial losses due to differences between past actuarial assumptions and actual plan experience, and assumption changes adopted as of December 31, 2004. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123”. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the option vesting period, based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense to be recognized over the option vesting period. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2004 (dollars in millions): Estimated Impact on Amount of Increase in Operating Income in 2004 Assumption Used Assumption (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $0.2 2004 grants 0.46% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% ($2.5) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year ($2.3) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries, realizability of long-lived and intangible assets and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moody’s. Operating Segments Prior to 2002, the Company operated in one reportable business segment – Ratings, which accounted for approximately 90% of the Company’s total revenue. With the April 2002 acquisition of KMV and its combination with Moody’s Risk Management Services to form Moody’s KMV, Moody’s now operates in two reportable business segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, the 18 Table of Contents Company restated its segment information for prior periods to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide additional information relating to Moody’s operating results, the discussion below includes information analyzing operating results as if the acquisition of KMV had been consummated as of January 1, 2002. This information is presented in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, and is described in more detail in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The Moody’s Investors Service business consists of four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed-income obligors and instruments in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are they allocated to the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moody’s KMV segment. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment products and services for banks and investors in credit-sensitive assets, credit training services and credit process software. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year over year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $52 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, over $26 million of Moody’s U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moody’s United States growth . Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year-to-year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moody’s international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Reported ratings revenue grew approximately $45 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $8 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moody’s expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately two-thirds of 19 Table of Contents total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moody’s increased its overall staffing by over 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2004 compared with year-end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,350 709 2,059 1,258 655 1,913 Moody’s KMV 343 75 418 318 69 387 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $ 375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and higher stock-based compensation expense. Moody’s global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moody’s U.S. and international ratings businesses, and at Moody’s KMV. Stock-based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year-to-year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year-to-year increase in expense principally reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year-to-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, and $4.7 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion, and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better-than-expected revenue growth. Moody’s reported $15.1 million of interest and other non-operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in October 2000 (see Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $2.86 and $2.79, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $2.44 and $2.39, respectively, for 2003. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Moody’s Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,310.7 million, up $176.0 million or 15.5% from $1,134.7 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the Euro. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $538.6 million for 2004, an increase of $78.0 million or 16.9% from $460.6 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market, and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year-to-year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $311.5 million in 2004, up $32.7 million or 11.7% from $278.8 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $26 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative-grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year-to-year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one-half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year-to-year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year-to-year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector, and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector, and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $169.5 million for 2004 was $42.6 million or 33.6% higher than the $126.9 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $513.7 million in 2004, an increase of $51.5 million or 11.1% from $462.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $37 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing 21 Table of Contents growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year-to-year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.9 million in 2004 versus $15.4 million in 2003. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $780.1 million in 2004 was up $123.0 million or 18.7% from $657.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year-to-year growth in operating income. Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV revenue of $127.6 million for 2004 was up $15.7 million or 14.0% from $111.9 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $4 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMV’s global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, including CreditEdge™, RiskCalc™ and Portfolio Manager™, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMV’s credit processing software and training products accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMV’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $104.1 million for 2004, an increase of $15.4 million or 17.4% from $88.7 million for 2003. The year-to-year increase primarily reflected growth of $11 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.2 million in both 2004 and 2003. MKMV operating income was $6.3 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year-to-year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2003 was $1,246.6 million, an increase of $223.3 million or 21.8% from $1,023.3 million in the prior year. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, Moody’s pro forma 2002 revenue would have been $1,038.4 million and year-to-year pro forma growth in 2003 would have been 20.1%. The Company benefited from strong growth in a number of U.S. ratings sectors, including residential mortgage-backed securities, home equity loan securitizations and the high yield segment of the corporate bond market, and from strong corporate issuance in Europe in the second half of the year. Moody’s research business produced very strong results and Moody’s KMV also generated good growth. In addition, foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Revenue in the United States was $795.3 million for 2003, an increase of $114.5 million or 16.8% from $680.8 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma United States revenue for 2002 would have been $688.4 million and year-to-year pro forma growth would have been 15.5%. Strong growth was achieved within Moody’s Investors Service, led by structured finance, corporate finance and research. Moody’s international revenue was $451.3 million in 2003, an increase of $108.8 million or 31.8% over $342.5 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002, pro forma international revenue for 2002 would have been $350.0 million and year-to-year pro forma growth would have been 28.9%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe and several other regions, with foreign currency translation accounting for approximately 650 basis points of reported revenue growth. International revenue accounted for 36% of Moody’s total revenue in 2003, compared with 33% in the prior year. 22 Table of Contents Overall, Moody’s expenses of $550.9 million in 2003 were $90.3 million or 19.6% greater than $460.6 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits continues to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately two-thirds of total expenses in 2003 and 2002. Moody’s increased its overall staffing by almost 200 people, or 9%, during 2003 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2003 compared with year-end 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,258 655 1,913 1,171 606 1,777 Moody’s KMV 318 69 387 276 57 333 Total 1,576 724 2,300 1,447 663 2,110 Operating expenses were $347.3 million in 2003, an increase of $62.0 million or 21.7% from $285.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma operating expenses would have been $290.1 million in 2002, and year-to-year growth would have been $57.2 million or 19.7%. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $48 million. This reflected compensation increases as well as increased staffing in Europe, the global structured finance business, the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative, and MKMV. The year-to-year operating expense increase also reflected $8.0 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $203.6 million in 2003, an increase of $28.3 million or 16.1% from $175.3 million in 2002. Assuming that Moody’s had owned KMV for all of 2002, pro forma SG&A expenses would have been $183.1 million in 2002, and year-to-year growth would have been $20.5 million or 11.2%. Year-to-year expense increases included higher professional fees of $4 million, mainly for legal costs, increased compensation and benefits of approximately $4 million, higher rent and occupancy costs to support business expansion, and $2.8 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for stock options granted in February 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32.6 million in 2003 from $24.6 million in 2002. Amortization of acquired software and intangible assets related to the KMV acquisition was $8.8 million in 2003 compared with $6.3 million in 2002. If the acquisition of KMV had been completed as of January 1, 2002, pro forma depreciation and amortization would have been $27.7 million in 2002 and the pro forma year-to-year increase would have been $4.9 million. This increase was principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Operating income of $663.1 million in 2003 rose $125.0 million or 23.2% from $538.1 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of the revenue growth mentioned above. The strength of foreign currencies, especially the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $8 million of reported operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2003 was 53.2% compared to 52.6% in 2002. The increase reflected the strong growth in revenue in the Moody’s Investors Service business without a proportional increase in expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were: (1) growth in Moody’s KMV revenue at a lower incremental margin than the Moody’s Investors Service business; and (2) 2003 expense of $10.8 million related to stock-based compensation with no counterpart in 2002. Interest and other non-operating expense, net was $6.7 million in 2003 compared with $20.7 million in 2002. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million on an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $1.7 million in 2003, down from $2.3 million in 2002 despite higher invested cash, due to lower U.S. interest rates in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign exchange gains were $2.2 million in 2003 and $0.3 million in 2002. 23 Table of Contents Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.6% in 2003 compared to 44.2% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate included the impact of a $16.2 million increase in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in October, 2000 (see Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters, below). This charge accounted for a 250 basis point increase in the effective rate in 2003. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impacts of continued operating growth in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than New York and tax benefits from the establishment of a New York captive insurance company during 2002. Net income was $363.9 million in 2003, an increase of $75.0 million or 26.0% from $288.9 million in 2002. Earnings per share were $2.44 basic and $2.39 diluted in 2003, compared with $1.88 basic and $1.83 diluted in 2002. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service for 2003 was $1,134.7 million, up $192.9 million or 20.5% from $941.8 million in 2002. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $22 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $460.6 million for 2003, an increase of $76.3 million or 19.9% from $384.3 million in 2002. Approximately $48 million of this increase was in United States revenue, which grew in the mid-teens percent range, and $28 million was in international, which grew in the low twenty percent range. In the United States, the residential mortgage and home equity loan sector contributed $15 million of revenue growth, as low interest rates drove strong refinancing activity. Good growth was also achieved in revenue from ratings of asset backed securities, reflecting year-to-year growth of about 10% in issuance volumes, particularly student loans, and higher average prices due to more complex transactions. Revenue from ratings of credit derivatives also grew year-to-year. Outside the United States, European structured finance was the main growth driver, contributing $24 million of year-to-year revenue growth. This principally reflected growth in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities. Foreign currency translation and price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global structured finance revenue. Corporate finance revenue was $278.8 million in 2003, up $51.1 million or 22.4% from $227.7 million in 2002. Revenue grew by $27 million in the United States, where the number of speculative grade issues rose significantly year-to-year due to refinancings and new issuers. In addition, the number of investment grade issuance transactions increased nearly 10% year-to-year, although dollar issuance declined. U.S. revenue growth was also derived from areas not related to public debt issuance such as syndicated bank loan ratings and relationship-based fees. In Europe, revenue grew by $19 million year-to-year. The dollar volume of issuance was up nearly 40% primarily due to refinancing activity (as spreads tightened) and new issuers accessing the market. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $181.2 million for 2003, an increase of $26.2 million or 16.9% from $155.0 million for 2002. The year-to-year growth was almost wholly due to Europe, where revenue growth exceeded 40%. This reflected a substantial year-to-year increase in issuance and the addition of new issuers. In the U.S., revenue was flat versus strong prior year comparisons. Price increases also contributed to global financial institutions revenue growth over the prior year. Public finance revenue of $87.2 million for 2003 was up $6.0 million or 7.4% from $81.2 million in 2002. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market grew 5% versus 2002, but issuance of short-term notes declined year-to-year. Refinancings represented approximately 34% of total dollar issuance in 2003 versus 33% in 2002. Research revenue increased $33.3 million or 35.6% to $126.9 million for 2003, compared with $93.6 million for 2002. Revenue grew by $18 million in the U.S. and $13 million in Europe. The strong performance was driven by 24 Table of Contents growth in licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $462.2 million in 2003, an increase of $76.5 million or 19.8% from $385.7 million in 2002. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $52 million of the total expense growth. This reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in Europe and the global structured finance business as well as the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Despite the increase in staffing, incentive compensation decreased slightly year-to-year due to lower growth in the Company’s operating results in 2003 compared with 2002. Other year-to-year expense increases included: $9.6 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation (mainly related to stock options granted in February 2003); $7 million for increased professional fees, mainly for legal fees and technology consulting costs; and $4 million related to rent, occupancy and travel related costs in connection with business expansion. Foreign currency translation also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million in 2003 versus $12.7 million in 2002. The year-to-year increase of $2.7 million principally related to computer hardware and software placed into service during 2003. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $657.1 million in 2003 was up $113.7 million or 20.9% from $543.4 million in 2002. Moody’s KMV The following table shows Moody’s KMV reported results for 2003 compared with the reported results for 2002 (the “reported comparisons”), and compared with 2002 on a pro forma basis presented as if Moody’s had acquired KMV on January 1, 2002 (the “pro forma comparisons”), in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 141 and as further described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The discussion of MKMV results of operations that follows is based on the pro forma comparisons. Reported Comparisons Pro Forma Comparisons 2003 Variance to 2002 2003 Variance to 2002 (dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % 2002 $ % Revenue $ 111.9 $ 81.5 $ 30.4 37.3 % $ 96.6 $ 15.3 15.8 % Operating expenses 88.7 74.9 13.8 18.4 % 87.5 1.2 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 17.2 11.9 5.3 44.5 % 15.0 2.2 14.7 % Operating income (loss) $ 6.0 ($5.3 ) $ 11.3 ($5.9 ) $ 11.9 MKMV’s pro forma year-to-year revenue increase in 2003 principally reflected $12 million of growth in subscription revenue from credit risk assessment products, including Credit EdgeTM, RiskCalcTM, and Portfolio ManagerTM. Revenue from license fees and maintenance related to credit processing software grew $2 million year-to-year. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased slightly compared to pro forma 2002 expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was flat year-to-year. The impacts of compensation increases and higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business were offset by lower expenses for incentive compensation due to below target operating performance in 2003, whereas performance was above target in 2002. Commission expense for third party distributors declined due to lower sales from this source in 2003. Expenses in 2003 included $1.2 million related to the Company’s change in accounting for stock-based compensation, mainly for options granted in February 2003. Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense reflected $8.8 million of amortization of acquired KMV software and intangible assets in each period. The pro forma year-to-year increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs. 25 Table of Contents Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 19 countries outside the United States. Approximately 25% of the Company’s revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro. Approximately 30% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2004, principally the Euro and the British Pound. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 18% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $606.1 million at December 31, 2004, approximately $102 million was located outside the United States (with $83 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality short-term securities within and outside the United States. By policy, the Company limits the amount it can invest with any one issuer and allocates its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds, short-term certificates of deposit or issuers of high-grade commercial paper. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $519.7 million, $468.4 million, and $334.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $51.3 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non-cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock-based compensation, and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Company’s separation from Dun & Bradstreet, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased by $133.6 million compared with 2002. The two largest factors affecting the year-to-year increase were growth in net income of $75.0 million, and a year-over-year decrease of $16.0 million in income tax payments despite an increase of $64.0 million in the income tax provision. Income tax payments totaled $210.6 million in 2003 compared to $226.6 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included $50 million of tax payments that were deferred from 2001 to 2002 due to the September 11th tragedy. Also, the 2003 amount was favorably affected by timing of tax payments. In addition to the two factors noted above, growth in deferred revenue accounted for $21.9 million of the year-to-year increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003, and higher non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation accounted for an additional $18.8 million of favorable variance. Partially offsetting these impacts, Moody’s investment in accounts receivable increased by $75.2 million year-to-year. This increase reflected continued growth in the business, significant year-to-year growth in billings in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an increase in days billings outstanding during 2003. 26 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $24.8 million, $17.1 million and $223.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities in each year principally consisted of capital expenditures, investments in affiliates and acquisitions (most notably the 2002 acquisition of KMV). The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Company’s ownership of Argentine rating agencies, as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Cash used for acquisitions included $205.4 million (net of cash acquired) for KMV in 2002. Spending for property and equipment and for the capitalization of development costs for MKMV’s software products totaled $21.3 million, $17.9 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $162.3 million, $227.7 million and $236.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Spending for share repurchases totaled $221.3 million in 2004, $171.7 million in 2003 and $369.9 million in 2002. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.0 million in 2004, $79.0 million in 2003 and $54.0 million in 2002. Dividends paid were $44.7 million, $26.8 million and $27.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share in 2004 versus $0.045 per share in 2003 and 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moody’s currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2005. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay a quarterly dividend, which the Board of Directors raised from $0.045 per share to $0.075 per share in December 2003. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to a proposed two-for-one stock split, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, as discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Dividends”, then on a post-split basis, the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company currently also intends to use the majority of its remaining cash flow provided by operating activities to continue its share repurchase program. However, the Company exercises discretion as to when and at what price to repurchase shares. Accordingly, share repurchase activity may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and there may be periods in which the Company does not repurchase shares. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays, including during 2005, to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Contingencies”. In addition, management is currently evaluating refinancing alternatives for its $300 million of notes payable outstanding, which mature in September 2005. It is possible that the Company may not immediately refinance these notes when they mature, in which case their repayment would substantially reduce the Company’s cash balance. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 27 Table of Contents Indebtedness At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $300 million of notes payable. The Company also had in place a $160 million bank revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2004. The $300 million of notes payable were secured in connection with the 2000 Distribution, as that term is defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution, Moody’s was allocated $195.5 million of debt at September 30, 2000. Moody’s funded this debt with borrowings under a $160 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility and a bank bridge line of credit. On October 3, 2000 the Company issued $300 million of notes payable (the “Notes”) in a private placement. The cash proceeds from the Notes were used in part to repay the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility and to repay the bridge line of credit. The Notes have a five-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 7.61%, payable semi-annually. In the event that Moody’s pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the “prepaid principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. Management is in the process of evaluating refinancing alternatives for the Notes when they mature in September 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Notes have been classified as a current liability. On September 1, 2004, Moody’s entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million 5-year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364-day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points, depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Earnings Coverage Ratio”), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2004, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2004. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Agreements also contain financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreements, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts due becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited 28 Table of Contents purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 (in millions) Total Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 322.8 $ 322.8 $ — $ — $ — Operating lease obligations 65.0 15.7 22.1 15.3 11.9 Capital lease obligations 1.3 1.3 — — — Contingent payment related to acquisition of Korea Investors Service (2) 3.7 3.7 — — — Purchase obligations (3) 5.9 2.7 2.8 0.4 — Total $ 398.7 $ 346.2 $ 24.9 $ 15.7 $ 11.9 (1) Includes $5.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2004 and $17.1 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, when the notes mature. (2) This amount reflects Moody’s current estimate of the contingent payment related to the acquisition of Korea Investors Service, which will be determined based on the net income of Korea Investors Service for the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for telecommunications, data processing services and back-up facilities, and professional services. 2005 Outlook Moody’s outlook for the full year 2005 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ from the outlook presented below. In the U.S., the Company expects mid-single-digit percent revenue growth for the ratings and research business for the full year 2005. In the U.S. structured finance market, Moody’s expects that revenue from rating residential mortgage and home equity securities will decline by approximately twenty percent or more in 2005 from the record level of 2004. The Company expects good year-over-year growth in several other sectors of U.S. structured finance, including asset-backed securities and credit derivatives, and flat to modest growth in asset-backed commercial paper and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, for the full year Moody’s expects a modest decline in U.S. structured finance revenue. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects that modest growth in investment-grade issuance and bank loan ratings, and revenue from our Enhanced Analysis Initiative, will offset relative weakness in speculative-grade bond activity, resulting in high single-digit percent growth in revenue. Flat issuance volume in the financial institutions sector in the U.S. is expected to be offset by revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new rating relationships, allowing low double-digit percent growth in this business in the U.S. in 2005. Moody’s expects a second consecutive year of modest year-to-year revenue decline in U.S. public finance. The Company is also forecasting continued strong growth in the U.S. research business. Outside the U.S. Moody’s expects growth in ratings and research revenue in the range of 20%, with double-digit percent growth in all major business lines in almost all regions assisted by favorable foreign currency impacts. The Company’s projection assumes improved corporate issuance in Europe after a relatively weak 2004, modest 29 Table of Contents issuance growth in the financial institutions sector and growth in several sectors of structured finance in Europe and Japan. In addition, Moody’s expects continued strong growth in international research revenue. Finally, the Company continues to expect global revenue to rise in the mid-teens percent range at Moody’s KMV, reflecting good growth in both credit risk assessment subscription products and credit processing software products. For Moody’s overall, the Company expects high single-digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2005 including the positive impact of currency translation. Moody’s expects the operating margin including the impact of expensing stock-based compensation to be down approximately 200 basis points in 2005 compared with 2004. This reflects slower revenue growth in 2005 than in 2004 and continued investments in expanding geographically, improving analytic processes, and pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives in the Moody’s Investors Service business, introducing new products and improving technology. For 2005 the Company expects that year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share will be in the mid-teens percent range. This expected growth includes the impacts of the legacy tax provisions in 2004 and the expensing of stock-based compensation in 2004 and 2005. The impact of expensing stock-based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.18 — $0.20 per diluted share in 2005, compared to $0.11 per diluted share in 2004. The estimated 2005 impact excludes any effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”, which will be effective as of July 1, 2005, and is more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets Approximately 80% of Moody’s revenue in 2004 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit-sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moody’s revenue growth from these sources in 2004 was lower than its growth in 2001 through 2003 as strong growth in global structured finance and financial institutions issuance, and ratings of U.S. high-yield issues and bank credit facilities, was partially offset by the impacts of declines in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moody’s provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business and financial results. Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive. Moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, price, 30 Table of Contents geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. Moody’s faces increasing competition from S&P, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company in the insurance industry). Since Moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions. Currently, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. On June 4, 2003, the SEC issued a Concept Release regarding the credit ratings industry, wherein it posed and requested public comment on a series of questions categorized into three broad areas: 1) should credit ratings continue to be used for regulatory purposes under the federal securities laws; 2) if so, what should be the process for determining whose credit ratings to use; and, 3) if credit ratings continue to be used in federal securities laws, what is the appropriate level of oversight for the agencies whose ratings are used? Numerous market participants, including Moody’s, responded to the call for comment. Moody’s response can be found on the Company’s website at www.moodys.com. At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SEC’s ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moody’s, or higher costs of operations. Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s. Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. Moody’s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets. However, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share. Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moody’s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions Moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not 31 Table of Contents have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Potential Emergence of Government-Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government-mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company. Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and/or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled “Regulation” in Item 1, “Business”, of this Form 10-K. At present, Moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business. 32 Table of Contents Multinational Operations Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. Operations in several different countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as: • changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moody’s operations or its customers’ use of ratings • possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions • restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars • currency fluctuations • export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers • difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel • longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables • political and economic instability • potentially adverse tax consequences Although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, any of these factors could have such an effect in the future. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters, based upon the latest information available. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability, if any. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material 33 Table of Contents adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies To understand the Company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moody’s and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”) and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”) (the “1996 Distribution”). Under the terms of the distribution agreement relating to the 1996 Distribution (the “1996 Distribution Agreement”), each party thereto is prohibited from distributing to its stockholders any business that had been allocated to it in connection with the 1996 Distribution, unless the distributed business delivers an undertaking agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 Distribution Agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 Distribution Agreement. In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation (“Donnelley”) (the “1998 Distribution”). During 1998, Cognizant through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). In September 2000, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Information Resources, Inc. The following is a description of an antitrust lawsuit filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”). As more fully described below, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”), AC Nielsen (US), Inc. (“ACN (US)”), and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”) (collectively, the “VNU Parties”), have assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moody’s does not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties default on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moody’s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would require the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. Moreover, as described below, on February 1, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against IRI dismissing IRI’s claims with prejudice and on the merits. In July 1996, IRI filed a complaint, subsequently amended in 1997, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants the corporation then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (now known as R.H. Donnelly), A.C. Nielsen Company (a subsidiary of ACNielsen) and IMS International, Inc. (a subsidiary of the company then known as Cognizant). At the time of the filing of the complaint, each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the company then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The amended complaint alleges various violations of United States antitrust laws under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The amended complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship. These claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of Survey Research Group Limited (“SRG”). IRI alleged SRG violated an alleged agreement with IRI when it agreed to be acquired by defendants and that defendants induced SRG to breach that agreement. IRI’s antitrust claims allege that defendants developed and implemented a plan to undermine IRI’s ability to compete within the United States and foreign markets in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe and 34 Table of Contents Australia/New Zealand through a series of anti-competitive practices, including: unlawfully tying/bundling services in the markets in which defendants allegedly had monopoly power with services in markets in which ACNielsen competed with IRI; entering into exclusionary contracts with retailers in certain countries to deny IRI’s access to sales data necessary to provide retail tracking services or to artificially raise the cost of that data; predatory pricing; acquiring foreign market competitors with the intent of impeding IRI’s efforts to expand; disparaging IRI to financial analysts and clients; and denying IRI access to capital necessary for it to compete. IRI is seeking in excess of $650 million, which IRI also asked to be trebled. IRI has filed with the Court the report of its expert who has opined that IRI suffered damages of between $582 million and $652 million from the defendants’ alleged practices. IRI also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. On June 21, 2004, pursuant to a stipulation between IRI and defendants, the Court ordered that certain of IRI’s claims be dismissed with prejudice from the lawsuit, including the claims that defendants tortiously interfered with the SRG acquisition. The Company believes that the dismissal of the tortious interference claims also precludes any claim for punitive damages. On December 3, 2004, the Court entered In limine Order No. 1, which bars IRI from “arguing that Nielsen’s pricing practices or discounts were illegal or anti-competitive unless it can prove they involved prices below short-run average variable cost, calculated without the inclusion of Nielsen’s ‘Fixed Operations’ costs”. On December 17, 2004, IRI issued a press release, which said in relevant part, “Without this evidence, IRI believes that little would be left of IRI’s case to take to trial”. IRI asked the Court to enter a final judgment against it, so that it could take an immediate appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Defendants did not object to this request. On February 1, 2005 the Court entered a final judgment dismissing IRI’s claims with prejudice and on February 2, 2005, the Court entered IRI’s notice of appeal to the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered that the appeal be argued no earlier than the week of June 13, 2005. In connection with the 1996 Distribution, NMR (then known as Cognizant Corporation), ACNielsen and Donnelley (then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation) entered into an Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement”), pursuant to which they agreed to: • allocate potential liabilities that may relate to, arise out of or result from the IRI lawsuit (“IRI Liabilities”); and • conduct a joint defense of such action. In 2001, ACNielsen was acquired by VNU N.V., which assumed ACNielsen’s obligations under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. Under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, Old D&B assumed all potential liabilities of Donnelley (then known as The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation) arising from the IRI action and agreed to indemnify Donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities. Under the terms of the 2000 Distribution, New D&B undertook to be jointly and severally liable with Moody’s for Old D&B’s obligations to Donnelley under the 1998 Distribution, including for any liabilities arising under the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement and arising from the IRI action itself. However, as between New D&B and Moody’s, it was agreed that under the 2000 Distribution, each of New D&B and Moody’s will be responsible for 50% of any payments required to be made to or on behalf of Donnelley with respect to the IRI action under the terms of the 1998 Distribution, including legal fees or expenses related to the IRI action. On July 30, 2004, the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B and IMS Health entered into an Amended and Restated Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement (the “Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, any and all IRI Liabilities incurred by Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B or IMS Health relating to a judgment (even if not final) or any settlement being entered into in the IRI action will be jointly and severally assumed, and fully discharged, exclusively by the VNU Parties. Under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the VNU Parties have agreed to, jointly 35 Table of Contents and severally, indemnify Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B and IMS Health from and against all IRI Liabilities to which they become subject. As a result, the cap on ACNielsen’s liability for the IRI Liabilities, which was provided for in the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, no longer exists and all such liabilities are the responsibility of the VNU Parties pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement provides that if it becomes necessary to post any bond pending an appeal of an adverse judgment, then the VNU Parties shall obtain the bond required for the appeal and shall pay the full cost of such bond. In connection with entering into the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B and IMS Health agreed to amend certain covenants of the Original Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement to provide operational flexibility for ACNielsen going forward. In addition, the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement includes certain amendments to the covenants of ACNielsen (which, under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, are now also applicable to ACN (US), which the Company understand holds ACNielsen’s operating assets), which are designed to preserve such parties’ claims-paying ability and protect Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B and IMS Health. Among other covenants, ACNielsen and ACN (US) agreed that neither they nor any of their respective subsidiaries will incur any indebtedness to any affiliated person, except indebtedness which its payment will, after a payment obligation under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement comes due, be conditioned on, and subordinated to, the payment and performance of the obligations of such parties under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. VNU N.V. has agreed to having a process agent in New York to receive on its behalf service of any process concerning the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As described above, the VNU Parties have assumed exclusive responsibility for the payment of all IRI Liabilities. However, because liability for violations of the antitrust laws is joint and several and because the rights and obligations relating to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement are based on contractual relationships, the failure of the VNU Parties to fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement could result in the other parties bearing all or a portion of the IRI Liabilities. Joint and several liability for the IRI action means that even where more than one defendant is determined to have been responsible for an alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiff can collect all or part of the judgment from just one of the defendants. This is true regardless of whatever contractual allocation of responsibility the defendants and any other indemnifying parties may have made, including the allocations described above between the VNU Parties, Donnelley, Moody’s, New D&B and IMS Health. Accordingly, and as a result of the allocations of liability described above, in the event the VNU Parties default on their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, each of Moody’s and New D&B will be responsible for the payment of 50% of the portion of any judgment or settlement ultimately paid by Donnelley (which is a defendant in the IRI action), which can be as high as all the IRI Liabilities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the IRI action (including the appeal), or the financial condition of any of the VNU parties or the other defendants at the time of any such outcome and hence the Company cannot estimate their ability to pay the IRI Liabilities pursuant to the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement or the amount of the judgment or settlement in the IRI action. However, provided that the VNU Parties fulfill their obligations under the Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement, the Company believes that the resolution of this matter, irrespective of the outcome of the IRI action, should not materially affect Moody’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If, however, IRI were to prevail in whole or in part in this action and if Moody’s is required to pay, notwithstanding such contractual obligations, a portion of any significant settlement or judgment, the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and New D&B and Moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as “Amortization Expense Deductions” for which New D&B and Moody’s are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and/or Moody’s pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “Utilization of Capital Losses”. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the “Royalty Report”). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the “Second Royalty Report”) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS’ intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the “Reallocation Report”). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the “Second Reallocation Report”) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996 (the “Preliminary Settlement”). The Preliminary Settlement was subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement. In addition, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS for 1993 and 1994 and plans to file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office. If the protest is unsuccessful New D&B can either: (1) abandon its tax refund claims; or (2) challenge the IRS claim in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Moody’s estimates that its exposure for the write-off of deferred tax assets related to these tax refund claims could be up to $9 million. As of June 30, 2004, Moody’s had adjusted its reserves for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter to reflect the Company’s estimates of probable exposure for the Preliminary Settlement and the other matters discussed in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, New D&B was required to obtain the consent of Moody’s, IMS Health and NMR as a condition to executing the formal settlement agreement, but New D&B was unable to obtain consent from IMS Health and NMR. Accordingly, New D&B and the IRS were unable to agree on the terms of a formal settlement agreement by the November 1st deadline imposed by the IRS. As a result, the IRS withdrew the Preliminary Settlement. 37 Table of Contents The Company believes that in accordance with the 1996 Distribution Agreement, IMS Health and NMR, by withholding their consent to the formal settlement agreement, would be contractually responsible to pay any excess amounts above the Preliminary Settlement that may ultimately be owing with respect to tax years 1995 and 1996. IMS Health has alleged various breaches of New D&B’s obligations under the 1996 Distribution Agreement related to New D&B’s management and attempted settlement of this matter. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moody’s understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Based on our current understanding of the positions of New D&B and IMS Health, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of New D&B’s preliminary settlement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moody’s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s has reassessed its exposure for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter taking into consideration: (1) the original Examination Reports discussed above (for which the Company’s share of the required payments to the IRS could be up to $103 million, including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits); and (2) the potential write-off of deferred tax assets (for which the Company’s exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Based on this assessment, in 2004, the Company increased its reserve for this matter by $16.4 million to reflect the current estimate of probable exposure. Moody’s believes that the positions taken by the IRS in the Royalty Reports and the Reallocation Reports discussed above are inconsistent with each other. While it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions noted above, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the “April Examination Reports”) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports, in which case New D&B would also have the aforementioned three courses of action. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moody’s from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moody’s at the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that the Company’s current potential exposure could be up to $95 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the preceding paragraph. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 could result in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the subsequent years. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&B’s payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moody’s 38 Table of Contents estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS could be up to $129 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. Moody’s believes that the IRS’s proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses The IRS has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. On June 26, 2000, the IRS, as part of its audit process, issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses. On May 12, 2000, an amended tax return was filed by Old D&B for the 1989 and 1990 tax years, which reflected $561.6 million of tax and interest due. Old D&B paid the IRS approximately $349.3 million of this amount on May 12, 2000; 50% of such payment was allocated to Moody’s and had previously been accrued by the Company. IMS Health informed Old D&B that it paid to the IRS approximately $212.3 million on May 17, 2000. The payments were made to the IRS to stop further interest from accruing, and on September 20, 2000, Old D&B filed a petition for a refund in the U.S. District Court. In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to this matter and in December 2004 executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received the first of three final assessments on February 15, 2005 and expects to receive the other two in the second quarter of 2005. Payment of the first assessment was made in the first quarter of 2005 and payment of the two other assessments is expected to be made in the second quarter of 2005. Moody’s estimates its share of these assessments to be approximately $15 million, reflecting cash payments of approximately $6 million and the write-off of deferred tax assets of approximately $9 million. In addition, IMS Health and NMR have notified New D&B that they disagree with various aspects of New D&B’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If the parties fail to resolve their dispute, Moody’s understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR. Moody’s believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but we cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In 2004, Moody’s increased its reserves for this matter by $14 million to reflect its current estimate of the probable exposure. Should IMS Health and NMR prevail in their position described in the prior paragraph, then Moody’s estimates that its exposure for this matter could increase by up to approximately $3 million. Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. During 2004 , the Company recorded charges of approximately $30 million to increase its reserves for the three legacy tax matters reflecting its current estimates of the probable exposures on these matters. The Company also recorded approximately $3 million of interest expense related to these reserves. As a result, at December 31, 2004, Moody’s total net legacy tax reserves were $136 million (consisting of $161 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $25 million of deferred tax assets). The $136 million of expected cash payments consists of $50 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty 39 Table of Contents Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $86 million of non-current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moody’s does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $354 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moody’s believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of 30 cents during the year. During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of 4.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock resulting in dividends paid per share of 18 cents in each year. On December 14, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2005. On February 15, 2005, the board voted to increase the quarterly dividend per share to $0.11, before giving effect to the proposed two-for-one stock split discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, payable on June 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2005. If the stock split is effected, then on a post-split basis the dividend will be increased to 5.5 cents per share from the 3.75 cents per share that otherwise would have been paid absent the dividend increase. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock outstanding and treasury shares. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock held on that date. Such additional shares will be distributed on May 18, 2005. The Board of Directors’ declaration of a special stock dividend distribution is subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Company’s authorized common shares. Moody’s stockholders will vote on the charter amendment at the Company’s Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2005. The proposal to amend the Company’s charter to increase the number of authorized shares will be more fully described in the Company’s annual meeting proxy statement. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Information The Company’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MCO”.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 39 and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” commencing on page 13 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor-oriented credit research, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies — Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 Distribution”. Critical Accounting Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 19 Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $35 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on factors such as the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring period is 26 years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage-backed securities was approximately $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above-noted factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts, could result in allowances that are greater or less than Moody’s estimates. In each of 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial 20 statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $8.8 million and charges of $30.0 million due to changes in the Company’s reserves, respectively, for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under “Legacy Tax Matters” below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Moody’s also reviewed the MKMV trade secret for impairment which was reclassified as a finite-lived asset beginning in December 2005. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Company’s judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and the MKMV trade secret, which charge could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moody’s reports for pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: • future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook • long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments) • future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near-term outlooks and assessments of likely long-term trends • discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2005 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. 21 Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise which are amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants. Total unrecognized actuarial losses for pension plans as of December 31, 2005 were $52.8 million and the Company expects to recognize approximately $3.3 million of such losses in the Company’s 2006 net periodic pension expense. Differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. The Company recognizes these differences over five years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has unrecognized plan asset gains of $0.4 million and the recognition of such gains is not expected to have a material impact on future net periodic pension expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2006 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2006 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post-retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2006 Estimated Impact on 2006 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.60% / 5.45% $ (4.4 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.6 Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.0 ) * Discount rates of 5.60% and 5.45% are used for pension plans and other post-retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have affected 2006 operating income. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post-retirement plans will be approximately $14.7 million in 2006 compared with $12.3 million (excluding a $3.2 million settlement loss) in 2005. The expected expense increase in 2006 reflects the effects of lower discount rates, normal growth in plan liabilities, the amendment to the Company’s healthcare plan to increase Moody’s share of future costs, higher compensation for the Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan participants, as well as amortization of actuarial losses. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123”. Therefore, employee stock options granted on and after January 1, 2003 are being expensed by the Company over the current four-year option vesting period (or sooner if employees are at or near retirement eligibility), based on the estimated fair value of the option award on the date of grant. The estimated fair value is calculated based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. 22 An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2005 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Amount of Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2005 (Decrease)/Increase Expected Dividend Yield 2003 grants 0.41% 0.10% $ 0.4 2004 grants 0.46% 2005 grants 0.52% Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 and 2004 grants 30% 5% $ (4.5) 2005 grants 23% Expected Option Holding Period 2003 and 2004 grants 5.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.1) 2005 grants 6.0 years Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moody’s. Operating Segments Moody’s Investors Service consists of four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed-income obligations in the debt markets, and research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit research, principally produced by the rating groups. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moody’s KMV segment. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moody’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Company’s authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Company’s Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moody’s stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock held on that date (the “Stock Split”). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 23 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year-to-year growth as well. Moody’s international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. Moody’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moody’s increased its overall staffing by approximately 390 people or about 16% during 2005. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2005 compared with year-end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,617 867 2,484 1,364 716 2,080 Moody’s KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,920 941 2,861 1,693 784 2,477 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock-based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moody’s global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock-based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year-to-year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year-to-year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year-to-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions 24 and $8.3 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moody’s reported $4.9 million of interest and other non-operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moody’s effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included an $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters”, below). Additionally, Moody’s recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service for 2005 was $1,598.9 million, up $281.4 million or 21.4% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $239.8 million of growth with approximately 81% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low-adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage-backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year-to-year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $321.8 million for 2005, up $22.2 million or 7.4% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many 25 issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part related to Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative, also contributed to year-to-year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer-term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short-term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moody’s information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock-based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $934.9 million in 2005 was up $152.7 million or 19.5% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year-to-year growth in operating income. Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV revenue of $132.7 million for 2005 was $11.9 million or 9.9% more than the same period in 2004. MKMV’s revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. 26 MKMV’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write-off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $4.7 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year-to-year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2003 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2004 was $1,438.3 million, an increase of $191.7 million or 15.4% from $1,246.6 million for 2003. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth in a number of business sectors. U.S. structured finance was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, primarily due to residential mortgage-backed and home equity loan securities. Research experienced robust growth in all geographies. U.S. corporate finance growth was primarily due to revenue related to the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield issues. Global financial institutions contributed to growth as well, most notably in the U.S. insurance and real estate sectors and the U.S. and European banking sectors. Revenue in the United States was $911.2 million for 2004, an increase of $115.9 million or 14.6% from $795.3 million for 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was due to growth in structured finance. The U.S. residential mortgage-backed and home equity sector was the largest contributor, driven by the favorable interest rate environment and a strong housing market. In addition, approximately $27 million of Moody’s U.S. revenue growth was contributed by corporate finance, primarily reflecting strong activity in the ratings of bank credit facilities and high yield bonds. The U.S. research business unit contributed about $20 million of growth. The financial institutions and MKMV businesses contributed approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, to Moody’s United States growth. Public finance revenue in the U.S. declined by approximately $5 million year-to-year, mainly due to a 6% decline in dollar issuance in the municipal bond market. Moody’s international revenue was $527.1 million in 2004, an increase of $75.8 million or 16.8% from $451.3 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $21 million of reported international revenue growth. Ratings revenue grew approximately $46 million, with about $27 million of that growth coming from structured finance. Europe contributed approximately 80% of the growth in international structured finance. Financial institutions and corporate finance contributed approximately $13 million and $6 million, respectively, to revenue growth. Research revenue growth of approximately $23 million was primarily in Europe. MKMV contributed approximately $6 million of revenue growth outside the U.S. Moody’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $617.8 million in 2004 were $66.9 million or 12.1% greater than $550.9 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits continued to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2004 and 2003. Moody’s increased its overall staffing by more than 175 people, or 8%, during 2004 to support continued growth in the business. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2004 compared with year-end 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,364 716 2,080 1,272 662 1,934 Moody’s KMV 329 68 397 304 62 366 Total 1,693 784 2,477 1,576 724 2,300 Operating expenses were $375.4 million in 2004, an increase of $28.1 million or 8% from $347.3 million in 2003. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $25 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock-based compensation expense. Moody’s 27 global staffing reflected hiring in the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative, in several of Moody’s U.S. and international ratings businesses and at Moody’s KMV. Stock-based compensation expense increased $12.3 million year-to-year. As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year-to-year increase in expense principally reflected the phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, as well as the effect of a higher share price on the value of the 2004 equity grants. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $242.4 million in 2004, an increase of $38.8 million or 19% from $203.6 million in 2003. Year-to-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $24 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and $4.7 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additional increases were due to higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $4 million to support business expansion and higher professional services costs, including spending of approximately $5 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Operating income of $786.4 million in 2004 rose $123.3 million or 18.6% from $663.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2004 was 54.7% compared to 53.2% in 2003. The increase in margin principally reflected better-than-expected revenue growth. Moody’s reported $15.1 million of interest and other non-operating expense, net in 2004 compared with $6.7 million in 2003. The 2003 amount included a gain of $13.6 million from an insurance recovery related to the September 11th tragedy, as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest expense was $23.0 million in 2004 and $23.5 million in 2003. The amounts in both periods included $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of private placement debt. Interest income was $6.8 million in 2004 compared to $1.7 million in 2003. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange gains were $1.9 million and $2.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Moody’s effective tax rate was 44.9% in 2004 compared to 44.6% in 2003. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates included charges aggregating approximately $30.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, for increases in reserves related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters”, below). Net income was $425.1 million in 2004, an increase of $61.2 million or 16.8% from $363.9 million in 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for 2003. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Moody’s Investors Service revenue for 2004 was $1,317.5 million, up $177.3 million or 15.5% from $1,140.2 million in 2003. Good growth was achieved in a number of ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $21 million to reported revenue growth, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, mainly versus the euro. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $553.1 million for 2004, an increase of $78.4 million or 16.5% from $474.7 million in the same period of 2003. Approximately $51 million of this increase was in the United States, with the residential mortgage and home equity sector contributing nearly $34 million of this amount. In this sector, growth was driven by increases in mortgage lending and home equity loans due to low interest rates, a strong housing market and gains in market coverage. Good growth was also achieved in U.S. revenue from ratings of 28 collateralized debt obligations (where the count of issues was up approximately 27% versus the prior year) and ratings of commercial mortgage-backed securities (driven by record market issuance). International structured finance revenue grew approximately $27 million; about 80% of the growth was attributable to Europe, with growth in all asset classes. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $9 million to year-to-year growth in global structured finance revenue. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth. Corporate finance revenue was $299.6 million in 2004, up $32.9 million or 12.3% from $266.7 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $27 million in the United States, reflecting strong growth in ratings of speculative-grade bonds as well as syndicated bank loans and other areas not related to public debt issuance. Price increases also contributed to revenue growth in this sector. These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of a year-to-year decline in issuance of investment grade securities in the U.S. markets. International corporate finance revenue grew approximately $6 million, with roughly one-half of the growth attributed to foreign currency translation. Underlying revenue growth primarily reflected higher issuance volumes in Asia outside of Japan and Australia. Issuance in Europe was weak compared to 2003. Speculative grade issuance was strong, but investment grade issuance declined year-to-year as improved corporate profitability reduced borrowing needs and mergers and acquisitions remained weak. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $208.9 million for 2004, an increase of $27.7 million or 15.3% from $181.2 million in 2003. In the U.S., revenue grew $15 million year-to-year, principally reflecting refinancings in the real estate sector, new relationships in the insurance sector and strong banking issuance as interest rate spreads tightened. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew approximately $13 million over the prior year, primarily in Europe. European growth reflected modest increases in issuance volumes, primarily in the banking sector and good growth from new rating relationships. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $3 million to revenue growth. Public finance revenue was $82.2 million for 2004, a decrease of $5.0 million or 5.7% from $87.2 million in 2003. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market declined 6% versus the same period in 2003, reflecting higher borrowing costs, a reduced pool of debt that was refunded and reduced borrowing needs due to strengthened tax receipts. Research revenue of $173.7 million for 2004 was $43.3 million or 33.2% higher than the $130.4 million reported in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $20 million in the U.S. and $16 million in Europe. The strong performance reflected growth in licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution, sales of new products to existing clients and new clients. Foreign currency translation also contributed approximately $6 million to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $518.0 million in 2004, an increase of $51.8 million or 11.1% from $466.2 million in 2003. Compensation and benefits expense accounted for $36 million of the expense growth. This increase included $15.0 million related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. The growth also reflected compensation increases and staffing growth in many areas, including the specialist teams that support Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative. Additionally, rent and occupancy costs increased approximately $5 million due to business expansion. Year-to-year expense growth also includes higher professional services costs. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $14 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense was $17.3 million in 2004 versus $15.9 million in 2003. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $782.2 million in 2004 was up $124.1 million or 18.9% from $658.1 million in 2003. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $7 million to the year-to-year growth in operating income. 29 Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV revenue of $120.8 million for 2004 was up $14.4 million or 13.5% from $106.4 million in 2003. Revenue grew by approximately $8 million in the U.S. and approximately $3 million in Europe. About $14 million of MKMV’s global revenue growth was related to subscriptions for its credit risk assessment products, representing high teens percent revenue growth. Sales of MKMV’s credit processing software accounted for approximately $2 million of revenue growth. MKMV’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million for 2004, an increase of $15.1 million or 17.8% from $84.7 million for 2003. The year-to-year increase primarily reflected growth of $13 million in compensation and related expenses. This reflected higher staffing to support the continued growth of the business as well as a $2.0 million increase related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.8 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MKMV operating income was $4.2 million for 2004 compared with $5.0 million for 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced MKMV reported year-to-year growth in operating income by approximately $2 million. Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 22 countries outside the United States. Approximately 26% of the Company’s revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 30% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2005, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 18% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $486.0 million at December 31, 2005, approximately $119 million was located outside the United States (with $84 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moody’s aggregate short-term investments of $94.5 million, approximately $18 million was located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions nor does the Company have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. However, the Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates and may enter into such transactions in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $707.9 million, $526.2 million and $467.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. 30 In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year-to-year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year-over-year non-cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in “Contingencies — Legacy Tax Matters”. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased by $59.2 million compared with 2003. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $61.2 million, which included increases in non-cash expenses of $17.0 million related to stock-based compensation and $13.8 million related to legacy tax provisions for which cash payments have not yet been made. In addition, cash tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in 2004 exceeded the prior year by $22.6 million. Partially offsetting these sources of cash in 2004 were negative effects due to timing of income tax payments. In 2004, the Company made approximately $47 million of income tax payments related to 2003 tax liabilities. This includes approximately $11 million related to the change in treatment of tax benefits for stock options outstanding prior to the Company’s separation from Old D&B, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used in investing activities was $150.4 million, $31.3 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for property and equipment, internal use software and for development costs for MKMV’s software products totaled $31.3 million, $21.3 million and $17.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net investments in marketable securities totaled $88.9 million, $6.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 spending on investments in affiliates included approximately $25 million related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and the $3.9 million contingent payment made in the second quarter related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount included approximately $3.5 million related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The 2003 amount included $1.1 million of cash acquired in connection with an increase in the Company’s ownership of Argentine rating agencies. Net cash used in financing activities was $666.5 million, $162.3 million and $227.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $691.7 million in 2005, $221.3 million in 2004 and $171.7 million in 2003. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $89.1 million in 2005, $105.0 million in 2004 and $79.0 million in 2003. Dividends paid were $60.3 million, $44.7 million and $26.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus $0.0375 per share in 2004 and $0.0225 per share in 2003. During 2003, the Company repaid $107.1 million of borrowings that had been outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Future Cash Requirements Moody’s currently expects to fund expenditures as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend among other things on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends, of which the Board of Directors declared a quarterly amount of $0.07 per share on December 13, 2005 payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow after dividends to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program. Systematic share repurchases may constitute the majority of the 31 Company’s potential repurchase activity. Moody’s will also be prepared to act opportunistically when conditions warrant. On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The Company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moody’s long-term interests. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Contingencies”. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes (“Notes”). The Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (“Old Notes”) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the “prepaid principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the prepaid principal. On September 1, 2004, Moody’s entered into a five-year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five-year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364-day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Earnings Coverage Ratio”), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2005, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2005. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with 32 such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 449.4 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 374.7 Operating lease obligations 63.9 16.7 24.0 12.5 10.7 Purchase obligations (2) 6.5 4.3 2.2 — — Total $ 519.8 $ 35.9 $ 56.1 $ 42.4 $ 385.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 and $145.7 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Purchase obligations include contracts for data processing services, data back-up facilities and professional services. 2006 Outlook Moody’s outlook for 2006 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moody’s overall, the Company projects revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit percent range for the full year 2006, including a small negative impact from foreign currency translation. Moody’s expects the operating margin after the impact of expensing stock-based compensation to decline by up to 150 basis points in 2006 compared with 2005. This reflects investments the Company is continuing to make to expand internationally, improve analytical processes, pursue ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introduce new products and improve technology infrastructure. For 2006, Moody’s projects year-over-year growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the high single-digit to double-digit percent range. This expected growth includes the impact of reserve adjustments related to legacy tax matters in 2005, and the expensing of stock-based compensation in both 2005 and 2006. 2006 represents the final 33 year of “phasing” for stock-based compensation, which began in 2003. The impact of expensing stock-based compensation is expected to be in the range of $0.12 - $0.14 per diluted share in 2006, compared to $0.10 per diluted share in 2005. In the U.S., the Company is forecasting mid-single-digit percent revenue growth for the Moody’s Investors Service ratings and research business unit for the full year 2006. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moody’s expects revenue for the year to rise modestly from the record level of 2005. The Company is projecting a high-teens percent decline from 2005 to 2006 in revenue from residential mortgage-backed securities, including home equity securitization, and notes a divergence in market views about the 2006 outlook for this business. Offsetting this expected decline, Moody’s looks for double-digit year-over-year growth in asset-backed securities, credit derivatives, and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company believes that modest growth in investment grade issuance, gains in rated share of the syndicated bank loan market, and incremental revenue from the Enhanced Analysis Initiative and new products will more than offset expected flat issuance in the speculative grade bond sector. Overall, Moody’s expects revenue in the U.S. corporate finance business to grow in the low double-digit percent range for the year. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects issuance by banks to increase slightly in 2006 compared with 2005 and issuance by insurers and other financial institutions to be flat or down. However, fee increases partly related to the Enhanced Analysis Initiative, as well as expected new ratings mandates, should produce revenue growth for the year in the low double-digit percent range. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moody’s believes that rising interest rates will slow refinancing activity and result in lower issuance in 2006 than 2005. The Company forecasts revenue for 2006 declining in the mid-single-digit percent range from the prior year. Moody’s forecasts strong growth in the U.S. research business unit at about twenty percent. Outside the U.S., the Company expects ratings revenue to grow in the low-teens percent range with high single-digit to mid-teens percent growth in all major business lines. This forecast assumes that foreign currency translation rates will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth for the year. In addition, the outlook assumes low- and mid-teens percentage growth in corporate revenue in Europe and Asia, respectively. For the financial institutions business Moody’s expects to see high single-digit revenue growth in Europe, after a year of very strong issuance in 2005, and low double-digit percent growth in Asia. The Company looks for low teens percentage growth in international structured finance and about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moody’s KMV globally, the Company expects moderate growth in net sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software, and professional services. This should result in mid- to high-single-digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moody’s business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these reserves as appropriate. In other instances, because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. 34 Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moody’s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moody’s as “Legacy Contingencies”. Information Resources, Inc. An antitrust lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”). A detailed description of this lawsuit was contained in reports previously filed by the Company with the SEC. As previously disclosed, VNU N.V., a publicly traded Dutch company, and its U.S. subsidiaries, VNU, Inc., ACNielsen Corporation, AC Nielsen (US), Inc., and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”) (collectively, the “VNU Parties”), had assumed exclusive joint and several liability for any judgment or settlement of this antitrust lawsuit under the terms of the July 30, 2004 Amended Indemnity and Joint Defense Agreement. As a result of the indemnity obligation, Moody’s did not have any exposure to a judgment or settlement of this lawsuit unless the VNU Parties defaulted on their obligations. However, in the event of such a default, contractual commitments undertaken by Moody’s in connection with various corporate reorganizations since 1996 would have required the Company to bear a portion of any amount not paid by the VNU Parties. On February 16, 2006, the parties to this action signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the action will be dismissed with prejudice and releases from liability will be exchanged among the parties. Such releases will also include the Company, although not a defendant in the litigation, as a releasee. Any amounts payable to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement will be paid by the VNU Parties, and the Company will not be required to contribute any amounts to the settlement payment. The dismissal of the lawsuit is subject to court approval and the releases are being held in escrow pending such approval. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and New D&B and Moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as “Amortization Expense Deductions” for which New D&B and Moody’s are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements, after New D&B and/or Moody’s pays the first $137 million, which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as “Utilization of Capital Losses”. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have, between themselves, agreed to each be financially responsible for 50% of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B received an Examination Report from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1993. In this Examination Report, the IRS stated its intention to disallow 35 certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 (the “Royalty Report”). In the first quarter of 2004, New D&B received a similar Examination Report (the “Second Royalty Report”) relating to the first quarter of 1997. During the second quarter of 2003, New D&B also received an Examination Report that had been issued by the IRS to the partnership, stating the IRS’ intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established in 1993 in connection with the above transaction, and to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax return for 1996 (the “Reallocation Report”). New D&B also received a similar Examination Report (the “Second Reallocation Report”) issued to the partnership with respect to the first quarter of 1997. In June 2004, New D&B and the IRS conducted a mediation of these issues, at which they reached a basis for settlement with regard to the Royalty Report for 1995 and 1996, the Reallocation Report, and certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1995 and 1996. The IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. The settlement was withdrawn by the IRS in November 2004. As a result of these events, the Company increased its reserves for this matter by $30 million in 2004. In 2005, New D&B, Moody’s, IMS Health and NMR executed a closing agreement with the IRS reflecting terms originally agreed to in June 2004. After executing the closing agreement, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&B’s calculation of each party’s share of the tax liability set forth in the agreement. As a result, New D&B and Moody’s each increased its share of the assessment by $7.3 million to $35.5 million and Moody’s paid approximately $34 million of this amount in October of 2005. These events resulted in a net reduction of tax expense of $11.5 million. New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the incremental amounts New D&B and Moody’s were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions which New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B should prevail, but Moody’s cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In addition, the Second Royalty Report and the Second Reallocation Report, which were not part of the closing agreement with the IRS, have not been resolved. Moody’s estimates that its share of the potential required payment to the IRS for this matter is $0.1 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS’ denial of certain tax refunds owing Old D&B for 1993 and 1994. Moody’s estimates that its remaining share of the potential liability for the Royalty Expense Deductions matter could be up to $16 million after payment pursuant to the closing agreement, which takes into consideration: (1) the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the federal closing agreement and (2) the potential write-off of receivables (for which the Company’s exposure could be up to $9 million as discussed above). Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the “April Examination Reports”) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction. This transaction was entered into in 1997 and has resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. New D&B disagrees with the position taken by the IRS and can either: (1) accept and pay the IRS assessment; (2) challenge the assessment in U.S. Tax Court; or (3) challenge the assessment in U.S. District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where in either case payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar 36 Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years, described below, in which case New D&B has the aforementioned three courses of action. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moody’s from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns, Moody’s would be required to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its 50% share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moody’s at the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that the Company’s current potential exposure could be up to $101 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). This exposure could increase by approximately $3 million to $6 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with the positions taken by the IRS and can take any of the three courses of action described in the first paragraph of this “Amortization Expense Deductions” section. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years described below. Similar Examination Reports could result for years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its 50% share of New D&B’s payments to the IRS for the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that its share of the potential exposure to the IRS for the potential disallowance of royalty expense deductions could be up to $135 million (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits). Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B had filed protests with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the April Examination Reports. In September 2004, the IRS Appeals Office remanded the case to the IRS examination office for further development of the issues. New D&B has reopened discussion of the issues with the examination office. On May 6, 2005, New D&B received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“Notice”) from the IRS for the 1999-2002 tax years which (1) disallows amortization expense deductions allocated from the partnership to Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and to New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns and (2) disallows certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns. On August 4, 2005, New D&B received an Examination Report (the “August Examination Report”) from the IRS disallowing certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1999 and 2000 tax returns and by New D&B on its 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax returns consistent with the Notice and in addition assessing a twenty percent penalty. New D&B has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office regarding the August Examination Report. Currently, the Company does not expect that the Notice or the Examination Report will have a material impact on the legacy tax reserves and the potential future outlays related to legacy tax matters that are discussed below in “Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters”. Moody’s believes that the IRS’ proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. 37 Utilization of Capital Losses In July 2004, New D&B and the IRS reached a basis for settlement of all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005, and is awaiting receipt of the third and final assessment. Moody’s paid its allocated share of the first two assessments consisting of cash payments of $12.8 million ($8.1 million net of expected tax benefits) and the utilization of a tax receivable of approximately $9 million. Moody’s remaining liability at December 31, 2005 was approximately $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moody’s included its share of approximately $4 million that Moody’s and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&B’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments. If New D&B fails to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, Moody’s understands that New D&B anticipates commencing arbitration proceedings against them. Moody’s believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moody’s had increased its reserves by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Three Legacy Tax Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and establishes reserves that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an $8.8 million net reversal of reserves of which $2.7 million related to an increase for the Utilization of Capital Losses matter and $11.5 million related to the reversal for the Royalty Expense Deductions described above. The Company has recorded $5.8 million of interest expense related to its legacy tax reserves. Moody’s total net legacy tax reserves were $97 million (consisting of $106 million of tax liabilities, partially offset by the expected utilization of $9 million of tax receivables). The $97 million of expected cash payments consists of $8 million of current liabilities (reflecting the estimated cash payments related to the Royalty Expense Deductions and Utilization of Capital Losses matters that are expected to be made over the next twelve months) and $89 million of non-current liabilities. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the amounts reserved by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Although Moody’s does not believe it is likely that the Company will ultimately be required to pay the full amounts presently being sought by the IRS, potential future outlays resulting from these matters could be as much as $252 million and could increase with time as described above. In matters where Moody’s believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 and $0.0225 per share, respectively, of Moody’s common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15 and $0.09, respectively. On December 13, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2006. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 38 Common Stock Information The Company’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MCO”.

(2) As of the last day of each of the months. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Moody’s repurchased 2.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $149.6 million and issued 1.1 million shares of stock under employee stock-based compensation plans. Since becoming a public company in October 2000 and through December 31, 2006, Moody’s has repurchased 84.4 million shares at a total cost of $2.9 billion, including 38.6 million shares to offset issuances under employee stock-based compensation plans. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the Company to the performance of Standard & Poor’s Stock 500 Index (the “S&P 500”) and an index of performance peer group companies (the “Performance Peer Group”). The Company does not believe there are any publicly traded companies that represent strict peers. However, each of the companies in the Performance Peer Group offers business information products in one or more segments of its business. The Performance Peer Group consists of Dow Jones & Company, Inc., The McGraw-Hill Companies, Pearson PLC, Reuters Group PLC, Thomson Corporation and Wolters Kluwer nv. The comparison assumes that $100.00 was invested in the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) and in each of the foregoing indices on December 31, 2001. The comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The total return for the Common Stock was 254% during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 35% for the S&P 500 and 27% for the Performance Peer Group.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 31 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, research and analysis covering fixed-income securities, other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets, and credit training services, and (ii) quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. Moody’s operates in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor-oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. The Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”) until September 30, 2000 (the “Distribution Date”), when Old D&B separated into two publicly traded companies — Moody’s Corporation and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). At that time, Old D&B distributed to its shareholders shares of New D&B stock. New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. The method by which Old D&B distributed to its shareholders its shares of New D&B stock is hereinafter referred to as the “2000 Distribution”. Critical Accounting Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue included approximately $47 million, $36 million and $30 million, respectively, related to such deferred monitoring fees. 15 Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities. Currently, the monitoring periods range from five to 46 years. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage-backed securities was approximately $62 million, $50 million and $37 million, respectively. Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included approximately $34 million, $31 million and $29 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances, as considered appropriate. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above-noted factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moody’s estimates. In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, commencing on page 28 is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust the provisions made in respect thereof. Since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material, and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the Company has reserved, their resolution could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. In addition, potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $2.4 million, $8.8 million and charges of $30 million, respectively, due to changes in the Company’s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are discussed under “Legacy Tax Matters” below. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Company’s judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 16 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moody’s reports for pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: • future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook • long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments) • future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near-term outlooks and assessments of likely long-term trends • discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank Pension Discount Curve. The cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (“SFAS No. 87”), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moody’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2006 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $ 41.0 million and Moody’s expects to recognize $2.2 million of actuarial losses in 2007 annual net periodic benefit expense. For Moody’s funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $7.8 million, of which $3.3 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in 2008 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2007 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2007 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post-retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for 2007 Estimated Impact on 2007 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 5.90% / 5.80% $ (5.3 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00% $ 1.8 Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35% $ (1.1 ) * Discount rates of 5.90% and 5.80% are used for pension plans and other post-retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2007 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post-retirement plans will be approximately 17 $14.4 million in 2007 compared with $14.9 million in 2006. The expected expense decrease in 2007 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses, which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (Revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2006 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase in Assumption Estimated Impact on Operating Income in 2006 Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2002 -2006 grants 0.41% -0.52% 0.10% $ 0.6 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2002 -2006 grants 23% -30% 5% $ (4.9 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2002 -2006 grants 4.5 –6.0 years 1.0 year $ (4.2 ) Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact Moody’s. Operating Segments Moody’s Investors Service consists of four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of (i) credit ratings on issuers and issues of fixed-income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit information, and research, principally produced by the rating groups, and economic commentary. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the Moody’s KMV segment. The Moody’s KMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks, corporations and investors in credit-sensitive assets. In February 2005, Moody’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected as a special stock distribution of one share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock outstanding, subject to stockholder approval of a charter amendment to increase the Company’s authorized common shares from 400 million shares to 1 billion shares. At the Company’s Annual Meeting on April 26, 2005, Moody’s stockholders approved the charter amendment. As a result, 18 stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2005 received one additional share of common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock held on that date (the “Stock Split”). Such additional shares were distributed on May 18, 2005. All prior period share and per share information has been restated to reflect the Stock Split. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million or 17.6% from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million or 17.7% from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year-over-year growth as well. Moody’s international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million or 17.5% from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $91 million versus the prior year, with about 84% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage-backed and residential mortgage-backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moody’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million or 18.8% more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moody’s average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2006 compared with year-end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moody’s KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million or 19.1% from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock-based compensation expense. Moody’s global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock-based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year-over-year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million or 18.2% from $303.9 million in 2005. Year-over-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moody’s new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. 19 Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a 160.6 million gain on the sale of Moody’s corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million or 34.0% from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year-over-year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moody’s operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moody’s reported $1.0 million of interest and other non-operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moody’s effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters” below for further information. Additionally, Moody’s recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million or 18.4% from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $250.6 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double-digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year-over-year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $886.7 million in 2006, an increase of $171.3 million or 23.9% from $715.4 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $109 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage-backed sectors contributing about 96% of the U.S. increase. Year-over-year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased “repackaging” of securitized assets such as consumer asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage-backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $62 million year-over-year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage-backed and residential mortgage-backed sectors totaled 92% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $2 million. Corporate finance revenue was $396.2 million in 2006, up $73.0 million or 22.6% from $323.2 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased approximately 22% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $28 million or about 24% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non-issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year-over-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $85.9 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.9 million or 6.4% from $91.8 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. 20 Research revenue of $258.7 million in 2006 was $43.4 million or 20.2% higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $28 million in the U.S. and about $15 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 41% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million or 22.3% from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock-based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moody’s new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moody’s corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year-to-year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moody’s KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMV’s revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision-making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMV’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non-income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write-off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year-to-year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2004 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2005 was $1,731.6 million, an increase of $293.3 million or 20.4% from $1,438.3 million during 2004. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth in several business sectors, including global structured finance, financial institutions and research, international corporate finance and U.S. public finance. Revenue in the United States was $1,085.4 million for 2005, an increase of $174.2 million or 19.1% from $911.2 million in 2004. Approximately 85% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and research, reflecting strong issuance across all structured asset classes and continued demand for core research products. U.S. financial institutions, public finance and corporate finance contributed to year-to-year growth as well. Moody’s international revenue was $646.2 million in 2005, an increase of $119.1 million or 22.6% from $527.1 million in 2004. International ratings revenue grew approximately $86 million versus the prior year, with approximately 77% of the growth related to Europe of which financial institutions contributed approximately $31 million of revenue growth primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings relationships. European structured finance, research and corporate finance contributed to growth as well. Favorable foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported international revenue growth. 21 Moody’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $756.8 million in 2005 were $139.0 million or 22.5% greater than $617.8 million in 2004. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for more than 70% of total expenses in 2005 and 2004. Moody’s average global staffing of approximately 2,700 employees during the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately 12% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes approximately 100 people due to the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2005 compared with year-end 2004. December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,600 919 2,519 1,358 761 2,119 Moody’s KMV 303 74 377 329 68 397 Total 1,903 993 2,896 1,687 829 2,516 Operating expenses were $452.9 million in 2005, an increase of $77.5 million or 20.6% from $375.4 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of $62.7 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing, higher stock-based compensation expense and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Moody’s global staffing reflected the acquisition of Economy.com in November 2005 and hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock-based compensation expense increased $18.7 million year-to-year. As more fully discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the fair value method provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively beginning on January 1, 2003. The year-to-year increase in expense reflects the phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period as annual equity grants are made, the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2005 equity grants versus 2004, and additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Outside service fees increased by approximately $7 million of which approximately $6 million relates to information technology investment spending. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $303.9 million in 2005, an increase of $61.5 million or 25.4% from $242.4 million in 2004. Year-to-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $29.4 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in finance and technology support functions and $8.3 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additionally, as a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $6 million of which approximately $3 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Operating income of $939.6 million in 2005 rose $153.2 million, or 19.5% from $786.4 million in 2004. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to operating income growth. Moody’s operating margin for 2005 was 54.3% compared to 54.7% in 2004. Moody’s reported $4.9 million of interest and other non-operating expense, net in 2005 compared with $15.1 million in 2004. Interest expense was $21.0 million in 2005 and $23.0 million in 2004. The amounts included $20.9 million and $22.8 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of notes payable for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $26.0 million in 2005 compared to $6.8 million in 2004. The increase was due to a higher average investment balance as well as an increase in the weighted average yield. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains were ($8.2) million and $1.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro. Moody’s effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2005 compared to 44.9% in 2004. The effective tax rates included $8.8 million in credits and $30.0 million in charges due to changes in reserves in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000 (see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters”, below). Additionally, Moody’s recognized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net income was $560.8 million in 2005, an increase of $135.7 million or 31.9% from $425.1 million in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.43 and $1.40, respectively, for 2004. 22 Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service for 2005 was $1,600.3 million, up $282.8 million or 21.5% from $1,317.5 million in 2004. Ratings revenue accounted for $241.2 million of growth with approximately 80% of that growth coming from global structured finance and European financial institutions. Good growth was achieved in a number of other ratings sectors as well as in research. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $7 million of reported revenue growth. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in reported revenue. Structured finance revenue was $715.4 million for 2005, an increase of $162.3 million or 29.3% from $553.1 million in 2004. Approximately $129 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the residential mortgage, collateralized debt and commercial mortgage sectors, contributing approximately 88% of this amount. Attractive mortgage products, such as low-adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as rising home prices and continued strength in the new housing market were key drivers in providing assets for residential mortgage securitizations. Demand for collateralized debt obligations increased as an ample supply of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations drove issuance higher. Global commercial mortgage-backed revenue was approximately $119 million, about 47% more than prior year, as record issuance drove revenue growth during the year. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $33 million year-to-year, with Europe contributing about $23 million. Corporate finance revenue was $323.2 million for 2005, up $23.6 million or 7.9% from $299.6 million in 2004. Revenue increased modestly in the U.S., as declines in high yield revenue largely offset higher revenue from bank loan ratings due to issuance related growth, an increase in first time rated issuers and price increases related in part to Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative. High yield bond issuance declined approximately 31% as many issuers shifted to the leveraged loan markets for financing needs. Conversely, investment grade corporate debt issuance increased about 5% compared to 2004, as numerous large deals came to market in the transportation, energy and technology sectors. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $18 million or about 19% due to new ratings mandates in Europe and Asia and increased investment grade corporate bond issuance. Price increases also contributed to year-to-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $254.6 million for 2005, an increase of $45.7 million or 21.9% from $208.9 million in 2004. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in issuance volume in insurance and a number of new rating assignments in the insurance, finance and securities sectors. Internationally, revenue grew approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased issuance and new ratings mandates in Europe. European issuance was particularly strong in the banking and insurance sectors. Price increases, in part, related to Moody’s Enhanced Analysis Initiative, which also contributed to year-to-year growth in global financial institutions revenue. Public finance revenue was $91.8 million for 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 11.7% from $82.2 million for the same period in 2004. Dollar issuance in the municipal bond market was approximately $409 billion or about 14% more than the same period in 2004, as issuers took advantage of low longer-term interest rates and narrow spreads between long and short-term rates, which favored advance refinancings. Refinancings represented approximately 45% of total dollar issuance in 2005 as compared to approximately 36% during 2004. Research revenue of $215.3 million for 2005 was $41.6 million or 23.9% higher than the $173.7 million reported in 2004. Revenue grew by approximately $19 million in the U.S. and about $22 million internationally with Europe accounting for approximately 76% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $26 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on corporate and financial institutions and the structured finance related business. Revenue growth from the licensing of Moody’s information to institutional customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $48 million, an increase of about $13 million, or approximately 37% from the prior year. Research revenue includes the results of Economy.com from November 17, 2005, the acquisition date. Foreign currency translation also contributed about $4 million to growth in international research revenue. Moody’s Investors Service operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses, were $645.4 million in 2005, an increase of $127.4 million or 24.6% from $518.0 million in 2004. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits of $86.8 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses, higher stock-based compensation expense of $25.7 million and $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. As a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005, expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005. Outside service fees increased by approximately $13 million of which approximately $9 million relates to information technology investment spending and about $2 million relates to legal fees. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $1 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. 23 Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $936.3 million in 2005 was up $154.1 million or 19.7% from $782.2 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $6 million to the year-to-year growth in operating income. Moody’s KMV Moody’s KMV revenue of $131.3 million for 2005 was $10.5 million or 8.7% more than the same period in 2004. MKMV’s revenue growth reflected increasing demand from risk products and credit decisioning software and software related consulting. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately $6 million or about 6% compared to prior year, but was adversely affected by higher cancellation rates, due in part to bank consolidations. In 2005, international revenue accounted for approximately 56% of global revenue. MKMV’s operating, selling, general and administrative expenses were $111.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million or 11.6% from $99.8 million for 2004. This increase included $1.3 million related to stock-based compensation, as discussed above. The 2005 expense also included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write-off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $3.3 million for 2005 compared with $4.2 million for 2004. Currency translation did not have a significant year-to-year impact on MKMV results. Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 21 countries outside the United States. Approximately 29% of the Company’s revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 36% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2006, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 30% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $408.1 million at December 31, 2006, approximately $232 million was located outside the United States (with $121 million in the U.K.), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, of Moody’s aggregate short-term investments of $75.4 million, approximately $14 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade auction rate securities within the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into hedging transactions to limit its risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In 2006, the Company entered into two insignificant hedging transactions using purchased put options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks from forecasted billings denominated in euros. Under the Company’s current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges currency risk exclusively for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Company’s cash flows. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact revenue. The Company continues to assess the need to enter into future hedging transactions and the Company does not have any material derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $752.5 million, $707.9 million and $526.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease 24 relating to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Company’s headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moody’s deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre-tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased by $181.7 million compared with 2004. Contributing to this growth was the increase in net income of $135.7 million, higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $27.0 million and higher tax benefits from exercise of stock options of $14.3 million. Improved collection of accounts receivable also benefited cash flow from operations by approximately $40 million. In addition, timing of quarterly federal, state and international income tax payments and growth in the tax provision for 2005 compared with 2004 contributed $56.7 million to year-to-year growth in cash provided by operating activities. Partially offsetting these benefits were the payment of $46.8 million related to the settlement of legacy tax matters as well as a $38.8 million reduction in year-over-year non-cash legacy income tax expense, as discussed below in “Contingencies — Legacy Tax Matters”. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $116.1 million, ($150.4) million and ($31.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for property and equipment and internal use software, totaled $31.1 million, $31.3 million and $21.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in marketable securities totaled $22.5 million, ($88.9) million and ($6.5) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 spending on acquisitions was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The 2004 amount primarily related to investments in rating agencies in Russia, Korea, Egypt and India. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Company’s headquarters building at 99 Church Street, New York, New York in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $965.2 million, $666.5 million and $162.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,093.6 million in 2006, $691.7 million in 2005 and $221.3 million in 2004. Dividends paid were $79.5 million, $60.3 million and $44.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.07 per share in 2006, $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share in 2004. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from exercises of stock options of $105.3 million in 2006, $89.1 million in 2005 and $105.0 million in 2004. The 2006 amount also includes $103.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities under SFAS No. 123R Future Cash Requirements Moody’s currently expects to fund expenditures from internally generated funds. The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2007. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company also currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. There is no established expiration date for this authorization. During 25 August 2006, the Company had completed its previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which had been authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2005. The Company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves Moody’s long-term interests. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the “Lease”) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square feet of an office building located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moody’s new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21-year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. The Company will incur approximately $110 million of costs in 2007 to fit out the new headquarters. The costs will be paid for using the proceeds from the sale of the Company’s current corporate headquarters building. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Contingencies”. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes (“Notes”). The Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to refinance $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes (“Old Notes”) which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all or part of the Notes in advance of their maturity (the “Prepaid Principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty calculated based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, as defined in the agreement, over the Prepaid Principal. On September 1, 2004, Moody’s entered into a five-year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $160 million that expires in September 2009. This Facility replaced the $80 million five-year facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2005 and the $80 million 364-day facility that expired in September 2004. Interest on borrowings under the Facility is payable at rates that are based on the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a premium that can range from 17 basis points to 47.5 basis points depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Earnings Coverage Ratio”), as defined in the related agreement. At December 31, 2006, such premium was 17 basis points. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees can range from 8 basis points of the Facility amount to 15 basis points, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio, and were 8 basis points at December 31, 2006. Under the Facility, the Company also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility exceeds 50% of the Facility. Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. The Notes and the Facility (the “Agreements”) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. The Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not less than 3 to 1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, and an Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, of not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events, significant corporate events or certain other events constituting an event of default under the Agreements, all loans outstanding under the Agreements (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Agreements may be terminated. In addition, certain other events of default under the Agreements would automatically result in amounts outstanding becoming immediately due and payable and all commitments being terminated. In October 2006, Moody’s amended its Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale-leaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building at 99 Church Street from $150 million to $250 million. Additionally, the 26 restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the sale of 99 Church Street was also increased from $150 million to $250 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the credit facility from $80 million to $340 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. This increase gives the Company potential borrowing capacity under the Facility of $500 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over 5 Years Notes payable (1) $ 430.7 $ 14.9 $ 29.9 $ 29.9 $ 356.0 Capital lease obligations 1.0 0.5 0.5 — — Operating lease obligations (2) 639.5 34.5 80.4 62.2 462.4 Purchase obligations (3) 30.4 23.6 6.7 0.1 — Total (4) $ 1,101.6 $ 73.5 $ 117.5 $ 92.2 $ 818.4 (1) Includes $3.7 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2006 and $127.0 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015, when the notes mature. (2) Includes the new operating lease agreement, which commenced on October 20, 2006, between the Company and 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square-feet located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which will serve as Moody’s new corporate headquarters in mid-to late-2007. See “Future Cash Requirements” for further information. (3) Purchase obligations include contracts for professional services, data processing services, telecommunication services and data back-up facilities. (4) In early 2007, the Company entered into contractual obligations of approximately $110 million related to the buildout of its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. These amounts are not included in the table above. 2007 Outlook Moody’s outlook for 2007 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ from the current outlook. For Moody’s overall, the Company projects low double-digit percent revenue growth for the full year 2007. This growth assumes foreign currency translation in 2007 at current exchange rates, which would result in no material full year impact from currency translation. Excluding the gain on sale of the 99 Church Street building, Moody’s expects the operating margin to decline by approximately 150 basis points in 2007, due to investments the Company is continuing to make to sustain business growth, including international expansion, improving analytical processes, pursuing ratings transparency and compliance initiatives, introducing new products, improving technology infrastructure and relocating Moody’s headquarters in New York City. Diluted earnings per share in 2007 are projected to be modestly lower compared to 2006 as a result of the after-tax gain of $94.1 million on the sale of the 99 Church Street headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the U.S., the Company projects low double-digit percent revenue growth for the Moody’s Investors Service ratings and research business for the full year 2007. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moody’s expects revenue for the year to rise 27 in the high-single to double-digit percent range, including strong double-digit year-over-year percent growth in revenue from credit derivatives and commercial mortgage-backed securities ratings, partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from residential mortgage-backed securities ratings, including home equity securitization. In the U.S. corporate finance business, Moody’s expects revenue growth in the low double-digit percent range for the year, including good growth from rated bonds, bank loans and new products. The Company anticipates a stronger first half of 2007 followed by a weaker second half in this sector, due in part to an expected moderation in the pace of leveraged buyout transactions. In the U.S. financial institutions sector, the Company projects revenue in 2007 to grow in the low teens percent range for the year. For the U.S. public finance sector, Moody’s expects revenue for 2007 to grow modestly. The Company forecasts growth in the U.S. research business to be about 20%. Outside the U.S., Moody’s expects ratings revenue to grow in the high-teens percent range with mid- to high-teens percent growth in all major business lines, led by corporate finance revenue growth in Europe and Asia, financial institutions growth in Europe and growth in international structured finance. The Company also projects about twenty percent growth in international research revenue. For Moody’s KMV globally, the Company expects growth in sales and revenue from credit risk assessment subscription products, credit decision processing software and professional services. This should result in low double-digit percent growth in revenue with greater growth in profitability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN No. 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on recognition and derecognition of tax benefits resulting from a subsequent change of judgment, classification of liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. In accordance with FIN No. 48, a company is required to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority, without considering time values. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and accordingly, is required to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company expects a reduction of retained earnings of between $40 million and $45 million with no impact to the statement of operations and cash flows. This is based on a preliminary assessment and could change based on final analysis which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007. After the initial adoption of FIN No. 48, the financial impacts to the statement of operations and cash flows is dependent upon the ultimate resolution of legacy tax matters and other tax matters with the taxing authorities. The Company is unable to predict the final resolution of these matters. See Note 16, “Contingencies” for further discussion of legacy tax matters. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value whereby fair value is based on an exit price that would result from market participants’ behavior, as well as sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share-based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 imposes no requirements for additional fair-value measures in financial statements and is effective for fair-value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impacts that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits 28 in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moody’s business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. In other instances, because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. Based on its review of the latest information available, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Moody’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, subject to the contingencies described below. Legacy Contingencies Moody’s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution. These contingencies are referred to by Moody’s as “Legacy Contingencies”. The principal Legacy Contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters. To understand the Company’s exposure to the potential liabilities described below, it is important to understand the relationship between Moody’s and New D&B, and the relationship among New D&B and its predecessors and other parties who, through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments, have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters. In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”) and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). In September 2000, Old D&B through a spin-off separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Legacy Tax Matters Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Pursuant to a series of agreements, as between themselves, IMS Health and NMR are jointly and severally liable to pay one-half, and New D&B and Moody’s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half, of any payments for taxes, penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements (excluding the matter described below as “Amortization Expense Deductions” for which New D&B and Moody’s are solely responsible) and certain other potential tax liabilities, also as described in such agreements. In connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have, between themselves, agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, three specific tax matters are discussed below. Royalty Expense Deductions This matter related to the IRS’s stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its tax returns for the years 1993 through 1996 as well as the IRS’s intention to reallocate to Old D&B income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for 1996. These matters were settled with the IRS in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of 2005 and accordingly, the Company reduced its reserve for this matter by $11.5 million. However, IMS Health and NMR disagreed with New D&B’s calculation of each party’s share of the liability. New D&B may commence arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect the $7.3 million that New D&B and Moody’s each were obligated to pay to the IRS on their behalf. Based upon the current understanding of the positions that New D&B and IMS Health may take, the Company believes it is likely that New D&B will prevail, but Moody’s cannot predict with certainty the outcome. 29 In the second quarter of 2006, Moody’s paid approximately $9 million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the October 2005 settlement with the IRS and reversed the remaining reserve of $1.5 million. Additionally, the IRS reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by Old D&B related to 1993 and 1994 may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in 1993. In the fourth quarter of 2005, New D&B filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office concerning the IRS’s denial of the tax refunds. In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS Appeals Office rejected New D&B’s protest. New D&B is determining whether to file suit for the refund. Moody’s share is estimated at approximately $9 million. Amortization Expense Deductions In April 2004, New D&B received Examination Reports (the “April Examination Reports”) from the IRS with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in 1997 which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. These deductions could continue through 2012. In the April Examination Reports, the IRS stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns. The IRS also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by Old D&B on its 1997 and 1998 tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction. In addition, the IRS stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to Old D&B certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for 1997 and 1998. New D&B disagrees with these positions taken by the IRS. IRS audits of Old D&B’s or New D&B’s tax returns for years subsequent to 1998 have resulted in the issuance of similar Examination Reports for the 1999 through 2002 tax years. Similar Examination Reports could result for tax years subsequent to 2002. Should any such payments be made by New D&B related to either the April Examination Reports or any potential Examination Reports for future years, including years subsequent to the separation of Moody’s from New D&B, then pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, Moody’s would have to pay to New D&B its share. In addition, should New D&B discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns, Moody’s would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits. New D&B had paid the discounted value of 50% of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to Moody’s at the Distribution Date. Moody’s estimates that the Company’s potential exposures (including penalties and interest, and net of tax benefits) could be up to $120 million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately $6 million to $10 million per year, depending on actions that the IRS may take and on whether New D&B continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns. Additionally, there are potential exposures that could be up to $164 million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to Old D&B. Moody’s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability. New D&B is currently in discussion with the IRS on these issues. On March 3, 2006, New D&B and Moody’s each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. Moody’s believes that the IRS’s proposed assessments of tax against Old D&B and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to Old D&B are inconsistent with each other. Accordingly, while it is possible that the IRS could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions, Moody’s believes that it is unlikely that the IRS will prevail on both. Utilization of Capital Losses In December 2004, New D&B executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by Old D&B during 1989 and 1990. New D&B received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of 2005. The third and final assessment was received in April 2006 of which Moody’s paid $0.3 million. The amounts paid by Moody’s for the first two assessments included its share of approximately $4 million that Moody’s and New D&B believe should have been paid by IMS Health and NMR, but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of New D&B’s calculation of their respective shares of the payments. New D&B was unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR, and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them. Moody’s believes that New D&B should prevail in its position, but the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome. In the first quarter of 2005, Moody’s had increased its liabilities by $2.7 million due to this disagreement. Summary of Moody’s Exposure to Legacy Tax Related Matters The Company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances. In doing so, Moody’s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 30 For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $2.4 million and $8.8 million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by $30.0 million, respectively. The Company also has recorded $3.5 million, $5.8 million and $3.4 million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Moody’s total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of December 31, 2006 were $93 million and are classified as long term. It is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows. In matters where Moody’s believes the IRS has taken inconsistent positions, Moody’s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments. However, Moody’s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the IRS would retain such duplicative payments. Dividends During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. During 2004, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.0375 per share of Moody’s common stock resulting in total dividends paid per share of $0.15. On December 12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

There is no established expiration date for either of these authorizations During the fourth quarter of 2007, Moody’s repurchased 7.7 million shares of its common stock, at an aggregate cost of $311.4 million, and issued 0.8 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. 14 PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the total cumulative shareholder return of the Company to the performance of Standard & Poor’s Stock 500 Index (the “S&P 500”) and an index of performance peer group companies (the “Performance Peer Group”). The Company does not believe there are any publicly traded companies that represent strict peers. However, each of the companies in the Performance Peer Group offers business information products in one or more segments of its business. The Performance Peer Group consists of Dow Jones & Company, Inc., The McGraw-Hill Companies, Pearson PLC, Reuters Group PLC, Thomson Corporation and Wolters Kluwer nv. The comparison assumes that $100.00 was invested in the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) and in each of the foregoing indices on December 31, 2002. The comparison also assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The total return for the Common Stock was 77% during the performance period as compared with a total return during the same period of 83% for the S&P 500 and 106% for the Performance Peer Group.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 41 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page 10 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements. The Company Except where otherwise indicated, the terms “Moody’s” and the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Moody’s is a provider of (i) credit ratings and related research, data and analytical tools, (ii) quantitative credit risk measures, risk scoring software, and credit portfolio management solutions and (iii) beginning in January 2008, fixed income pricing data and valuation models. In 2007 and prior years, Moody’s operated in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s KMV (“MKMV”). Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the business reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the reorganization, the rating agency remains in the Moody’s Investors Service operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other commercial activities, including MKMV and sales of MIS research, are now combined under a new operating company known as Moody’s Analytics. Moody’s Investors Service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. It also publishes investor-oriented credit information, research and economic commentary, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, special comments and credit opinion handbooks. The MKMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services including credit processing software and analytical tools for credit portfolio management. Prior to September 30, 2000, the Company operated as part of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (“Old D&B”). On September 8, 2000, the Board of Directors of Old D&B approved a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies – the Company and The New D&B Corporation (“New D&B”). On September 30, 2000 (“the Distribution Date”), Old D&B distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding shares of New D&B common stock (the “2000 Distribution”). New D&B comprised the business of Old D&B’s Dun & Bradstreet operating company (the “D&B Business”). The remaining business of Old D&B consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services (the “Moody’s Business”) and was renamed “Moody’s Corporation”. New D&B is the accounting successor to Old D&B, which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 8, 1998. Old D&B began operating as an independent publicly-owned corporation on July 1, 1998 as a result of its June 30, 1998 spin-off (the “1998 Distribution”) from the corporation now known as “R.H. Donnelley Corporation” and previously known as “The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation” (“Donnelley”). Old D&B became the accounting successor to Donnelley at the time of the 1998 Distribution. Prior to the 1998 Distribution, Donnelley was the parent holding company for subsidiaries then engaged in the businesses currently conducted by New D&B, Moody’s and Donnelley. Prior to November 1, 1996, it also was the parent holding company of subsidiaries conducting business under the names Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”) and ACNielsen Corporation (“ACNielsen”). On that date Donnelley effected a spin-off of the capital stock of Cognizant and ACNielsen to its stockholders (the “1996 Distribution”). Cognizant subsequently changed its name to Nielsen Media Research, Inc. in connection with its 1998 spin-off of the capital stock of IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”). For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the Company and New D&B after the 2000 Distribution and to provide for an orderly transition, the Company and New D&B entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement, tax allocation agreement, employee benefits agreement, shared transaction services agreement, insurance and risk management services agreement, data services agreement and transition services agreement. Detailed descriptions of the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Distributions are contained in the Company’s 2000 annual report on Form 10-K, filed on March 15, 2001. 17 Critical Accounting Estimates Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenue Recognition In recognizing revenue related to ratings, Moody’s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the Company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer. These judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties, but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods. In such cases, the Company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods. The portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors, including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers. The monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities. Currently, the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue included approximately $54 million, $47 million and $36 million, respectively, related to such monitoring fees. Additionally, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, derivatives, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods, ranging from nine to 46 years, which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $86 million, $72 million and $57 million, respectively. Moody’s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers’ most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, accounts receivable included approximately $38 million, $34 million and $31 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, the Company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Accounts Receivable Allowance Moody’s records, as reductions of revenue, provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions. Such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Adjustments to and write-offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance. Moody’s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts. Moody’s also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its reviews, Moody’s establishes or adjusts allowances as considered appropriate in the circumstance. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody’s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than Moody’s estimates. In each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance. Contingencies Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in the “Contingencies” section of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations”, commencing on page 38 is highly subjective 18 and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities. Based on its review of the latest information available, and subject to the contingencies described in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contingencies”, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Moody’s future reported results and financial position. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the provision for income taxes reflected credits of $27.3 million, $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, due to changes in the Company’s liabilities for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by Moody’s in connection with its separation from Old D&B in October 2000. These tax matters are more fully described under the caption “Legacy Contingencies” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the Company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates. In estimating future operating results and cash flows, Moody’s considers internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, and the effects of external factors and market conditions. If actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the Company’s judgments, or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made, an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which charge could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Restructuring Charge The Company has engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs, contract termination costs and asset impairments. If the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted. For a full description of Moody’s restructuring actions, refer to the “Results of Operations” section below and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The expenses, assets, liabilities and obligations that Moody’s reports for pension and other post-retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions include the following: • future compensation increases, based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook • long-term return on pension plan assets, based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments) • future healthcare cost trends, based on historical market data, near-term outlooks and assessments of likely long-term trends • discount rates, based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds The discount rate selected to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2007 was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares the plans’ projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the Citibank pension discount curve. The cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined. Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. 19 When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. To the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (“SFAS No. 87”), the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For Moody’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the total losses as of December 31, 2007 which have not been recognized in annual expense are $19.0 million and in 2008, Moody’s expects amortization of actuarial losses to be immaterial. For Moody’s funded pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under SFAS No. 87, the Company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has an unrecognized asset gain of $4.1 million, of which $1.7 million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets’ component of 2009 expense. The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2008 operating income (dollars in millions). These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2008 assets, liabilities, obligations and expenses related to pension and other post-retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available. Assumption Used for2008 Estimated Impact on2008 Operating Income (Decrease)/Increase Discount Rate* 6.45% / 6.35 % $ (5.8 ) Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate 4.00 % $ 0.7 Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets 8.35 % $ (1.2 ) * Discount rates of 6.45% and 6.35% are used for pension plans and other post-retirement plans, respectively. A one percentage-point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect 2008 projected expenses. Based on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to pension and post-retirement plans will be approximately $13 million in 2008 compared with $16.2 million in 2007, excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of $10.8 million in 2007. The expected expense decrease in 2008 reflects the effects of higher discount rates, lower amortization of actuarial losses and reduction in workforce due to restructuring, which are partially offset by lower plan asset gains. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company implemented, under the modified prospective application method, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”). Under this pronouncement, companies are required to record compensation expense for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Previously, on January 1, 2003, the Company implemented, on a prospective basis, the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Some of the assumptions and estimates, such as share price volatility and expected option holding period, are based in part on Moody’s experience during the period since becoming a public company, which is limited. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense. An increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in 2007 (dollars in millions): Assumption Used Increase inAssumption Estimated Impact onOperating Income in 2007Increase/(Decrease) Average Expected Dividend Yield 2003 - 2007 grants 0.41% - 0.52% 0.10 % $ 1.2 Average Expected Share Price Volatility 2003 - 2007 grants 23% - 30% 5 % $ (4.6 ) Expected Option Holding Period 2003 - 2007 grants 5.0 - 6.0 years 1.0 year $ (3.9 ) 20 Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter-company transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. Moody’s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy and other tax matters. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its FIN No. 48 tax liabilities. On January 1, 2007, upon the implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses. Prior to the implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense. In accordance with FIN No. 48, prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change. FIN No. 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. Upon the initial implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company recorded a reduction of its January 1, 2007 retained earnings of $43.3 million, which is comprised of $32.9 million of tax and accrued interest of $17.3 million ($10.4 million, net of tax). As the determination of FIN No. 48 liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus, the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s net income or financial condition. Other Estimates In addition, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements, including recoverability of deferred tax assets, anticipated dividend distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s. Operating Segments Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the implementation of the business reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the reorganization, the rating agency remains in the Moody’s Investors Service operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other commercial activities, including MKMV and sales of MIS research, are now combined under a new operating company known as Moody’s Analytics. See “Reorganization and New Segments” section below. In 2007 and prior years, Moody’s operated in two reportable segments: Moody’s Investors Service and MKMV. Moody’s Investors Service consisted of (i) four rating groups — structured finance, corporate finance, financial institutions and sovereign risk, and public finance — that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings to issuers and issues of fixed-income obligations in the debt markets, and (ii) research, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor-oriented credit information research, data and other analytical tools that are produced principally by the rating groups. For presentation purposes, Europe represents Europe, the Middle East and Africa and public finance represents U.S. public finance. Given the dominance of Moody’s Investors Service to Moody’s overall results, the Company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses, nor are such expenses allocated between the Company’s business segments. Accordingly, all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the Moody’s Investors Service segment and none have been allocated to the MKMV segment. The MKMV business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services, including credit processing software and analytical tools for credit portfolio management. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 21 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue for 2007 totaled $2,259.0 million, an increase of $221.9 million, or 10.9%, from $2,037.1 million for the same period in 2006. The main contributors to this growth were the corporate finance and research lines of business, which increased $85.3 million, or 22.4%, and $69.8 million, or 27.4%, respectively. MKMV revenue contributed 5.4% of the Company’s year-over-year growth, driven by the software and risk subscriptions businesses. Revenue in the United States was $1,361.8 million in 2007, an increase of $84.0 million, or 6.6%, from $1,277.8 million in 2006. Corporate finance and research revenue achieved strong growth of $51.7 million and $33.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a $29.4 million decline in structured finance, resulting from the significant slow down in the credit securitization markets. International revenue was $897.2 million in 2007, an increase of $137.9 million, or 18.2%, from $759.3 million in 2006. Revenue from the structured finance, research and corporate finance lines of business contributed approximately $39 million, $36 million and $34 million, respectively, to the increase. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $39 million of international revenue growth. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) in response to the Company’s reorganization and a decline in current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors, as more fully described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. A restructuring charge of $50.0 million was recorded in 2007, which consisted of $45.9 million of expenses relating to severance and other employee benefit costs, and $4.1 million for contract termination costs. Moody’s operating and selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) of $1,035.1 million in 2007 were $136.4 million, or 15.2%, more than $898.7 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately 70% of total operating and SG&A expenses, representing approximately $77 million in growth from prior year. Moody’s average global staffing of approximately 3,500 employees during the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately 13% higher than during 2006. This increase reflects the impact of hiring from late 2006 and the first half of 2007 to support business growth mainly in the U.S., Asian and European ratings businesses offset by a partial completion of the workforce reductions relating to the restructuring actions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007. The table below shows Moody’s global staffing by operating segment and geographic area at December 31, 2007 and 2006. December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,869 1,284 3,153 1,843 1,106 2,949 Moody’s KMV 297 122 419 304 97 401 Total 2,166 1,406 3,572 2,147 1,203 3,350 Operating expenses were $584.0 million in 2007, an increase of $44.6 million, or 8.3%, from $539.4 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits expense comprised approximately 77% of the growth, reflecting normal salary increases coupled with higher staffing levels compared to prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The staffing level increase reflects hiring in the first half of 2007 to support business growth, primarily in the international ratings businesses where headcount increased by approximately 14% over 2006. Non-compensation expenses of $96.8 million increased $10.2 million primarily from professional service costs associated with technology investments. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $451.1 million in 2007, an increase of $91.8 million, or 25.5%, from $359.3 million in 2006. Compensation expense of $238.8 million increased $46.5 million, or 24.2%, from 2006 reflecting increased staffing levels in the corporate compliance and technology support functions coupled with the increase in stock-based compensation. Non-compensation expense of $212.3 million was up $45.3 million, or 27.1%, over 2006 due to higher rent and occupancy costs of $39.3 million, or 88.2%, over 2006 primarily related to the Company’s relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7 World Trade Center (“7WTC”) and an increase in professional service costs of $21.6 million relating to technology investment spending and legal matters. 22 Operating income in 2007 includes a $50.0 million restructuring charge consisting of $45.9 million of expenses relating to severance and other employee benefit costs and $4.1 million for contract termination costs, as further discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating income of $1,131.0 million decreased $128.5 million, or 10.2%, from $1,259.5 million in 2006, which reflects approximately $21 million of foreign currency translation gains. Moody’s operating margin for 2007 was 50.1% compared to 61.8% in 2006. The restructuring charge in 2007 decreased the 2007 margin by approximately 220 basis points while the gain on building sale increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Interest and other non-operating (expense) income, net was $(14.3) million in 2007 compared with $1.0 million in 2006. Interest expense on borrowings was $40.7 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to borrowings under the Company’s credit facilities, the issuance of the $300.0 million Series 2007-1 Notes in September 2007, and issuance under the Company’s commercial paper program which was established in October 2007. Interest expense on FIN No. 48 tax liabilities was $21.5 million in 2007. In 2006, before Fin No. 48 became effective, interest on tax liabilities was reported as part of income tax expense, net of Federal tax benefit. There was also a $17.5 million reduction of accrued interest expense and a $14.4 million increase in other non-operating income both for amounts due to New D&B related to the “Amortization Expense Deductions” legacy tax matter more fully described in Contingencies – Legacy Contingencies, below. Interest income earned on short-term investments and invested cash balances was $19.3 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were immaterial in both 2007 and 2006. Moody’s effective tax rate was 37.2% in 2007 compared to 40.2% in 2006. The 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates included benefits of $27.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters” below for further information. Additionally in 2007, there was a $14.4 million increase in other non-operating income, which was not taxable, related to legacy tax matters. These matters favorably impacted the Company’s 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates by approximately 295 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. Net income was $701.5 million in 2007, a decrease of $52.4 million, or 7.0%, from $753.9 million in 2006. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007 were $2.63 and $2.58, respectively, compared to $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, for 2006. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2007, the gain on building sale in 2006 and legacy tax adjustments in both years, net income increased $21.8 million, or 3.3%, and earnings per share increased $0.25, or 11.1%, to $2.50 per share. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in 2007 was $2,104.2 million, up $209.9 million, or 11.1%, from $1,894.3 million in 2006. Ratings revenue accounted for $140.1 million of the increase, with growth largely driven by global corporate finance, and financial institutions. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $32 million of ratings revenue growth. Global corporate finance revenue totaled $465.4 million in 2007, an increase of $85.3 million, or 22.4%, from $380.1 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $51.7 million, or 21.0%, primarily due to exceptionally strong growth in speculative grade and bank loans in the first half of 2007 offset by revenue declines in the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006. In the second half of 2007, U.S. investment grade revenue increased 57.0% compared to a 7.7% increase in the first half of 2007. International revenue of $167.1 million increased $33.6 million, or 25.2%, largely driven by growth in European investment grade and speculative grade bond issuance as well as a 71.2% increase in bank loan revenue. Global financial institutions revenue was $303.1 million, up $36.3 million, or 13.6%, from $266.8 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $15.1 million, principally due to strong performance within the banking and insurance sectors driven by debt refinancing and funding for share repurchases. International revenue of $165.3 million grew $21.2 million, or 14.7%, from prior year mainly due to increased corporate bond issuance activity and a significant number of new ratings mandates both within the European banking sector. Global structured finance revenue was $890.6 million for 2007, an increase of 1.1%, or $10.0 million, from $880.6 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S., decreased $29.4 million, or 5.0%, in a mixed year where strong growth in the first half, largely from the derivatives and commercial mortgage-backed securities sectors, was offset by significant revenue declines in the second half of 2007 principally in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities as well as derivatives due to the 23 credit market turmoil which began early in the third quarter of 2007. Outside the U.S., revenue of $328.5 million increased $39.4 million, or 13.6%, reflecting strong growth from derivatives and residential mortgage-backed securities of $19.7 million and $12.3 million, mostly in the European region. International growth was 40.4% in the first half of 2007 offset by a significant slowdown in the second half of 2007 due to the credit market turmoil. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $16 million. Public finance revenue was $120.8 million, an increase of $8.5 million, or 7.6%, from $112.3 million in 2006. Revenue growth was driven by a $4.4 million, or 12.4% increase in the housing, health care, higher education, and infrastructure sectors as well as a $3.0 million, or 11.3%, increase in the municipal structured products sector. Global research revenue of $324.3 million was $69.8 million, or 27.4%, higher than the $254.5 million in 2006, as a result of strong sales of core research products and analytic services to new and existing customers. U.S. revenue of $176.0 million increased $33.8 million, or 23.8%, and international revenue increased $36.0 million, or 32.1%, with 77.5% reflecting growth in Europe. Moody’s Investors Service operating, and SG&A expenses, including corporate expenses, were $922.1 million, an increase of $133.0 million, or 16.9%, from $789.1 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits expense comprised the largest portion of the 2007 expense growth, accounting for 50.8% of the increase from 2006, reflecting normal salary increases, higher staffing primarily in the international ratings businesses where headcount grew approximately 16% from 2006, as well as in the corporate compliance and technology support functions. Stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the year-over-year increase primarily due to the higher Black-Scholes value of the 2007 equity grants compared to prior years. Non-compensation expenses in 2007 included increased rent and occupancy costs of $39.8 million related to the Company’s relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and increases in professional service costs of approximately $25 million primarily due to information technology investment spending and legal expenses. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $17 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $1,105.4 million in 2007 was down $137.5 million, or 11.1%, from $1,242.9 million in 2006. Operating income included a $45.6 million restructuring charge in 2007 and a $160.6 million gain on the sale of the former corporate headquarters building in 2006. Excluding the restructuring charge and gain on building sale, operating income increased $68.7 million, or 6.3%, with foreign currency translation contributing approximately $22 million of the growth. Moody’s KMV Revenue at MKMV in 2007 was $154.8 million, up $12.0 million, or 8.4%, from $142.8 million in 2006. Global revenue was driven by growth in annualized risk subscriptions and software license fees of $8.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively. U.S. revenue of $66.8 million increased 6.9% from $62.5 million in 2006. Outside the U.S., revenue increased $7.7 million, or 9.6%, over prior year. MKMV’s operating and SG&A expenses in 2007 including the $4.4 million restructuring charge, were $117.4 million, an increase of $7.8 million, or 7.1%, from $109.6 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits expense increased $9.9 million primarily reflecting normal salary increases coupled with increased staffing as well as an approximate $2 million reduction of certain employee obligations reflected in 2006. MKMV operating income was $25.6 million for 2007, an increase of $9.0 million, or 54.2%, compared with $16.6 million in 2006. Excluding the restructuring charge, MKMV’s 2007 operating income increased $13.4 million, or 80.7%, from 2006. Currency translation did not have a significant year-to-year impact on MKMV results. Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005 Total Company Results Moody’s revenue in 2006 was $2,037.1 million, an increase of $305.5 million, or 17.6%, from $1,731.6 million for the same period of 2005. Moody’s achieved strong revenue growth above the rate of the overall corporation in global structured finance, corporate finance and research, and below the corporate rate in financial institutions and MKMV, with a decline in revenue from public finance. 24 Revenue in the United States was $1,277.8 million in 2006, an increase of $192.4 million, or 17.7%, from $1,085.4 million in 2005. Approximately 80% of the U.S. growth was driven by structured finance and corporate finance, reflecting strong issuance across most structured asset classes as well as corporate bonds and bank loans. Research, financial institutions and MKMV contributed to year-over-year growth as well. Moody’s international revenue was $759.3 million in 2006, an increase of $113.1 million, or 17.5%, from $646.2 million in 2005. International ratings revenue grew approximately $96 million versus the prior year, with about 80% of the growth in Europe where credit derivatives, corporate finance, commercial mortgage-backed and residential mortgage-backed sectors were primary drivers of growth. European research and MKMV contributed to growth as well. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Moody’s operating and SG&A expenses of $898.7 million in 2006 were $141.9 million, or 18.8%, more than $756.8 million in 2005. Compensation and benefits continue to be Moody’s largest expense, accounting for approximately $103 million in growth from prior year. Moody’s average global staffing of more than 3,100 employees during the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 15% higher than during the same prior year period. This increase includes hiring to support business growth mainly in the U.S. and European ratings businesses. The table below shows Moody’s staffing at year-end 2006 compared with year-end 2005. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 United States International Total United States International Total Moody’s Investors Service 1,843 1,106 2,949 1,600 919 2,519 Moody’s KMV 304 97 401 303 74 377 Total 2,147 1,203 3,350 1,903 993 2,896 Operating expenses were $539.4 million in 2006, an increase of $86.5 million, or 19.1%, from $452.9 million in 2005. The largest contributor to this increase was growth in compensation and benefits expense of approximately $76 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing and higher stock-based compensation expense. Moody’s global staffing reflected hiring primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses to support business growth. Stock-based compensation expense increased $16.3 million year-over-year due, in part, to the final year of phasing in of expense over the current four-year equity plan vesting period and the effects of a higher share price on the value of the 2006 equity grants versus 2005, offset by additional expense recorded in the first quarter of 2005 related to the accelerated expensing of equity grants for employees at or near retirement eligibility. Expenses for 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $359.3 million in 2006, an increase of $55.4 million, or 18.2%, from $303.9 million in 2005. Year-over-year expense increases included growth in compensation and benefits of $27 million, reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing in technology support and finance functions and $6.0 million related to stock-based compensation as discussed above. Additional 2006 expenses included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $12 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moody’s new corporate headquarters. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Operating income of $1,259.5 million in 2006, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moody’s corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006, rose $319.9 million, or 34.0%, from $939.6 million in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, operating income increased 17.0%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year-over-year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moody’s operating margin for 2006 was 61.8% compared to 54.3% in 2005. The gain on the sale of the building increased the 2006 margin by approximately 790 basis points. Moody’s reported $1.0 million of interest and other non-operating income (expense), net in 2006 compared with ($4.9) million in 2005. Interest expense was $15.2 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005. The amounts included $14.9 million and $20.9 million of interest expense on Moody’s $300 million of notes payable for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income was $18.2 million in 2006 compared to $26.0 million in 2005. The decrease was attributed to the liquidation of investment portfolios to finance share repurchases. Foreign exchange losses were immaterial in 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the British pound and euro appreciating to the U.S. dollar. Moody’s effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2006 compared to 40.0% in 2005. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates were reduced by benefits of $2.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to legacy income tax matters, see “Contingencies – Legacy Tax Matters” below for further information. Additionally, Moody’s recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3 million related to additional foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2006 rate was also favorably impacted by approximately 30 basis points due to the settlement of state tax audits. 25 Net income was $753.9 million in 2006, an increase of $193.1 million or 34.4% from $560.8 million in 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.65 and $2.58, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.88 and $1.84, respectively, for 2005. Excluding the gain on sale, 2006 net income was $659.8 million, an increase of $99.0 million or 17.7%. Additionally, the gain contributed $0.33 and $0.32 relating to full year basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Segment Results Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in 2006 was $1,894.3 million, up $294.0 million, or 18.4%, from $1,600.3 million in 2005. Ratings revenue accounted for $254.8 million of growth with increased revenue in global structured finance, corporate finance and financial institutions and sovereign risk offsetting a decline in public finance. Double-digit growth in research also contributed to the increase in revenue. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenue growth by approximately $1 million. Price increases also contributed to year-over-year growth in revenue. Structured finance revenue was $880.6 million in 2006, an increase of $181.3 million, or 25.9%, from $699.3 million in the same period of 2005. Approximately $111 million of the increase was in the U.S., with the collateralized debt and commercial mortgage-backed sectors contributing about 94% of the U.S. increase. Year-over-year issuance of collateralized loan obligations and cash flow resecuritizations grew, in part, to the increased “repackaging” of securitized assets such as consumer asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as bank loans in collateralized debt obligations. Strong growth in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation issuance was a key driver of overall commercial mortgage-backed issuance. International structured finance revenue grew approximately $70 million year-over-year, with Europe contributing about $61 million, where credit derivatives, commercial mortgage-backed and residential mortgage-backed sectors totaled approximately 87% of the European growth. Foreign currency translation for structured finance positively impacted international revenue growth by approximately $3 million. Corporate finance revenue was $380.1 million in 2006, up $66.3 million, or 21.1%, from $313.8 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased 20.8% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. Investment grade bond issuance increased approximately 17% and high yield bond issuance increased approximately 43%, primarily due to significant mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and second lien loan activity. International corporate finance revenue increased approximately $24 million or about 22% due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non-issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Price increases also contributed to year-over-year growth in global corporate finance revenue. Revenue in the financial institutions and sovereign risk group was $266.8 million in 2006, an increase of $12.2 million or 4.8% from $254.6 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue grew approximately $11 million, principally due to strength in insurance and real estate sectors. Internationally, revenue increased $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. Public finance revenue was $112.3 million in 2006, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.3%, from $117.3 million in 2005. Dollar volume issuance in the municipal bond market declined compared to 2005, primarily due to lower refinancing activity. Research revenue of $254.5 million in 2006 was $39.2 million, or 18.2%, higher than $215.3 million in 2005. Revenue grew by approximately $29 million in the U.S. and about $11 million internationally, with Europe accounting for approximately 57% of international growth. Research and analytics services accounted for approximately $17 million of global revenue growth primarily from credit research on the corporate finance, financial institutions and the structured finance related businesses. Revenue from the licensing of Moody’s information to financial customers for internal use and redistribution was approximately $57 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $8 million, or about 17% higher than the prior year. Moody’s Investors Service operating and SG&A expenses, including corporate expenses, were $789.1 million in 2006, an increase of $143.7 million, or 22.3%, from $645.4 million in 2005. The largest contributor to 2006 expenses was growth in compensation and benefits of approximately $110 million reflecting compensation increases, increased staffing primarily in the U.S. and European ratings businesses and higher stock-based compensation expense of $21.4 million. Furthermore, expenses in 2006 included increased rent and occupancy costs of approximately $11 million to support business expansion and costs associated with Moody’s new corporate headquarters. Additional increases were due to increased information technology investment spending of approximately $8 million offset by a decrease of approximately $6 million in legal fees. Expenses for 2005 included a charge of $9.4 million for the settlement of sales tax matters related to Moody’s operations in Japan from 2000 through June 30, 2005, which was a result of a tax audit by Japanese taxing authorities that was completed in the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, expenses in 2005 included $3.2 million for the settlement of certain pension obligations. Foreign currency translation contributed approximately $4 million to year-to-year growth in reported expenses. 26 Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $1,242.9 million in 2006 was up $306.6 million or 32.7% from $936.3 million in 2005, which included a $160.6 million gain on the sale of Moody’s corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain, operating income increased 15.6%. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced year-to-year growth in operating income by approximately $3 million. Moody’s KMV MKMV revenue of $142.8 million in 2006 was $11.5 million or 8.8% more than the same period in 2005. MKMV’s revenue growth reflected increased demand for credit decision-making software and software related maintenance services, which grew approximately 10% or $2.7 million compared to 2005. Growth in subscriptions revenue related to credit risk assessment products grew approximately 5% or $4.9 million compared to prior year and risk services revenue increased approximately $4 million or about 36% compared to prior year. In 2006, international MKMV revenue accounted for 56% of its global revenue. MKMV’s operating and SG&A expenses were $109.6 million in 2006, a decrease of $1.8 million or 1.6% from $111.4 million in 2005. The 2006 expenses include a total of $3.5 million due to training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses. Additionally, 2006 expenses include a $2.2 million charge recorded in connection with a non-income tax matter. The 2005 expenses included approximately $7 million related to severance costs, the write-off of capitalized software development and a liability for unpaid overtime due to certain employees. MKMV operating income was $16.6 million for 2006 compared with $3.3 million in 2005. Currency translation did not have a significant year-to-year impact on MKMV results. Reorganization and New Segments Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the implementation of the business reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the reorganization, the rating agency remains in the Moody’s Investors Service (“MIS”) operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other commercial activities, including MKMV, sales of credit research produced by Moody’s Investors Service and the production and sales of other products and services, are now combined under a new operating company known as Moody’s Analytics (“Analytics”). The aforementioned reorganization will result in the Company operating in two new reportable segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”, beginning in January 2008. The tables below present operating results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as if the new segment structure described above had been in place as of January 1, 2005. Revenue for MIS and expenses for Analytics includes an intersegment royalty charged to Analytics for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, overhead costs and corporate expenses of the Company, all of which were previously included in the former MIS segment, are allocated to each new segment based on a revenue split methodology. Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resource, information technology and legal. “Eliminations” represents intersegment royalty revenue/expense.

Sovereign and sub-sovereign ratings which were previously part of financial institutions; infrastructure/utilities ratings, which were previously part of corporate finance; and project finance, which was previously part of structured finance, were combined with the Public Finance business to form a new line of business called Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance. In addition, real estate investment trust ratings were moved from corporate finance to the structured finance business. Within Moody’s Analytics various aspects of the legacy MIS Research business and MKMV business were combined to form the subscriptions, software and consulting businesses. The subscriptions business includes credit and economic research, data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis; the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk software products, and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling, credit scorecard development, and other specialized analytical projects, as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a per-engagement basis. 28 The following is a discussion of the results of operations of the new segments, excluding the aforementioned intersegment royalty revenue and related expense, as if they were operating as of January 1, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006 Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in 2007 was $1,779.9 million, up $140.1 million, or 8.5%, from $1,639.8 million in 2006. Global corporate finance, financial institutions and the public, project and infrastructure finance business increased $75.6 million, $39.6 million, and $22.6 million, respectively. Global corporate finance revenue totaled $411.5 million in 2007, an increase of 22.5%, from $335.9 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $45.3 million, or 20.2%, primarily due to increased leveraged loan activities and growth in investment grade bond issuance. International revenue of $141.5 million increased $30.3 million, or 27.2%, largely driven by growth in European bond issuance. Global financial institutions revenue was $261.7 million, up $39.6 million or 17.8% from $222.1 million in 2006. Revenue in the U.S. increased $18.9 million, or 18.4%, principally due to strong performance within the banking and insurance sectors driven by debt refinancing and funding for share repurchases. International revenue of $139.7 million grew $20.7 million, or 17.4%, from prior year mainly due to increased corporate bond issuance activity and a significant number of new ratings mandates both within the European banking sector. Global structured finance revenue was $885.9 million for 2007, an increase of $2.3 million from $883.6 million in 2006. Revenue of $569.6 million in the U.S., decreased $35.5 million, or 5.9%, in a mixed year where strong growth in the first half of 2007, largely from the credit derivatives and commercial real estate finance sectors, which includes real estate investment trusts, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities, which were offset in the second half of 2007 by declining revenue in the residential mortgage-backed securities, derivatives and commercial real estate finance as a result of credit market turmoil which reduced ratable issuance volume. Outside the U.S., revenue of $316.3 million increased $37.7 million, or 13.6%, reflecting strong growth from derivatives and residential mortgage-backed securities of $19.8 million and $12.3 million, mostly in the European region. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $220.8 million, an increase of $22.6 million, or 11.4%, from $198.2 million in 2006. Revenue from project and infrastructure finance of $76.1 million showed the strongest growth with an increase of $13.5 million or 21.6% over 2006, mostly from within the U.S. Revenue of $144.7 million from the public finance sector, including U.S. public finance, sovereign and sub-sovereign, increased $9.1 million, or 6.7%, over prior year driven by growth in combined issuance and new money issuance. Operating expenses, including allocated corporate expenses and a $41.3 million restructuring charge in 2007, were $800.7 million, an increase of $134.6 million, or 20.2%, from $666.1 million in 2006. Compensation and benefits expense was the largest contributor to the year-over-year growth reflecting increased staffing internationally to support business growth, as well as additional headcount in the corporate compliance group. Stock-based compensation expense increased year-over-year primarily due to the higher Black-Scholes value of the 2007 equity grants compared to prior years. Non-compensation expenses in 2007 included an increase in allocated expenses such as increased rent and occupancy costs related to the Company’s relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and increases in professional service costs primarily due to information technology investment spending and legal matters. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $955.2 million in 2007 was flat compared to 2006. Excluding the $41.3 million restructuring charge, 2007 operating income of $996.5 million increased $40.1 million, or 4.2%, from $956.4 million in 2006. Moody’s Analytics Revenue for Moody’s Analytics was $479.1 million, an increase of $81.8 million, or 20.6%, from 2006. U.S. revenue of $242.8 million increased $38.1 million, or 18.6%, and international revenue increased $43.7 million, or 22.7%, with 90.3% of the growth from Europe. Revenue from subscription products of $421.5 million was up $74.0 million, or 21.3%, over $347.5 million in 2006, reflecting continued demand from new and existing customers for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics 29 and other offerings. Software revenue of $39.5 million increased $3.2 million, or 8.8%, from $36.3 million in 2006 primarily from additional license and maintenance fees for credit decisioning and analysis products. Revenue from consulting services grew $4.6 million, or 34.1%, due to increased demand for credit education, risk modeling and scorecard development among customers seeking to implement sophisticated risk management processes and comply with regulatory requirements. Operating expenses in 2007 including allocated corporate expenses and the $8.7 million restructuring charge, were $284.4 million, an increase of $51.8 million, or 22.3%, from $232.6 million in 2006. The increase is a result of additional compensation due to headcount growth of 8% and higher sales commission expense resulting from better than expected revenue growth over 2006. It also reflects an increase in allocated expenses due to increased rent and occupancy costs related to the Company’s relocation to its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and increases in professional service costs primarily due to information technology investment spending and legal matters. Moody’s Analytics operating income of $175.8 million in 2007 increased $33.3 million, or 23.4%, from $142.5 million in 2006. Operating income included an $8.7 million restructuring charge in 2007. Excluding the restructuring charge, 2007 operating income of $184.5 million increased $42.0 million, or 29.5%, from $142.5 million in 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005 Moody’s Investors Service Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in 2006 was $1,639.8 million, up $254.9 million or 18.4% from $1,384.9 million in 2005 with global structured and corporate finance accounting for $233.4 million, or 91.6%, of the growth. Structured finance revenue was $883.6 million in 2006, an increase of $174.9 million or 24.7% from $708.7 million in the same period of 2005. Revenue in the U.S. of $605.0 million increased $111.4 million, or 22.6%, with commercial real estate finance, consisting of real estate investment trusts, commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and credit derivatives contributing $22.2 million and $85.6 million of the increase, respectively. International structured finance revenue grew $63.4 million year-over-year, with Europe contributing about $58 million, where credit derivatives, commercial real estate finance and residential mortgage-backed sectors totaled 91.7% of the European growth. Corporate finance revenue was $335.9 million in 2006, up $58.5 million or 21.1% from $277.4 million in 2005. Revenue in the U.S. increased 22.3% principally due to issuance related growth in bank loan and corporate bond ratings revenue. International revenue of $111.2 million increased $17.5 million, or 18.7%, due largely to increased corporate bond issuance and non-issuance related ratings fees in Europe. Financial institutions revenue was $222.1 million in 2006, an increase of $8.1 million or 3.8% from $214.0 million in 2005. In the U.S., revenue of $103.0 million grew $8.2 million, or 8.6%, principally due to strength in the insurance sector. Internationally, revenue was relatively flat compared to 2006 with decreases in Europe being offset by increases in Asia and other international locations. Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $198.2 million in 2006, an increase of $13.4 million or 7.3% from $184.8 million in 2005, reflecting good growth in the project and infrastructure sectors internationally. Operating expenses, including allocated corporate expenses, were $666.1 million in 2006, an increase of $111.7 million, or 20.1%, from $554.4 million in 2005. The increase is due to incentive compensation reflecting improved financial results over prior year, additional salaries and benefits expense relating to higher global staffing to support the business growth. Non-compensation expense increased over 2006 reflecting additional travel, training and recruiting, as well as an increase in professional service fees associated with technology investment spending. Moody’s Investors Service operating income of $956.4 million in 2006 was up $141.4 million, or 17.3%, from $815.0 million in 2005 mostly driven by the growth in revenue. 30 Moody’s Analytics Revenue for Moody’s Analytics was $397.3 million, an increase of $50.6 million, or 14.6%, from $346.7 million in 2005. U.S. revenue of $204.7 million increased $33.1 million, or 19.3%, and international revenue increased $17.6 million, or 10.1%, with 63.1% reflecting growth in Europe. Revenue from subscription products of $347.5 million was up $42.5 million, or 13.9%, over $305.0 million in 2005, benefiting from higher sales of core research and data services coupled with new customer growth and lower attrition. Software revenue of $36.3 million increased $2.7 million, or 8.0%, from $33.6 million in 2005 reflecting greater demand for risk products and credit decision-making software and related maintenance services. Revenue from consulting services was $13.5 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 66.7%, from $8.1 million in 2005 reflecting an increase in the risk management needs of customers and the completion of contractual milestones. Operating expenses, including allocated corporate expenses, were $232.6 million in 2006, an increase of $30.2 million, or 14.9%, from $202.4 million in 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits relating to sales commissions from higher revenue coupled with additional staffing over 2005. The increase also reflects additional training and recruitment, sales and marketing expenses to support business growth, as well as a $2.2 million charge in 2006 relating to a non-income tax related matter. Market Risk Moody’s maintains operations in 27 countries outside the United States. Approximately 33% of the Company’s revenue was billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2007, principally the British pound and the euro. Approximately 42% of the Company’s expenses were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2007, principally the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 35% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S. Of Moody’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents of $426.3 million at December 31, 2007, approximately $348 million was located outside the United States (with $104 million and $88 million in Luxembourg and the U.K., respectively), making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, all of Moody’s aggregate short-term investments of $14.7 million were located outside the United States. The effects of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar on assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment account in shareholders’ equity. Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high quality investment grade securities within and outside the United States. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market mutual funds and issuers of high-grade commercial paper. Short-term investments primarily consist of high quality investment grade corporate bonds in Korea. The Company manages its credit risk exposure on cash equivalents and short-term investments by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. A portion of the Company’s future billings and related revenue is exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the euros and British pound. Under the Company’s current foreign exchange hedging program, the Company hedges a portion of foreign exchange currency risk for the purpose of reducing volatility in the Company’s cash flows related to future euro and British pound billings and related revenue. Foreign exchange options are currently utilized to hedge these exposures and have maturities between one and fifteen months. As of December 2007 all contracts were set to expire at various times through March 2009 and were deemed to be highly effective under SFAS No. 133 and related accounting pronouncements. No credit losses are anticipated as the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the Company’s outstanding options was recorded as an asset of $2.3 million consisting of the following notional amounts: Currency Pair of Option* Notional amount * GBP/USD £ 7.9 million EUR/USD € 16.7 million EUR/GBP € 61.5 million * GBP(£)=Great Britain pounds; EUR(€)=euros; USD($)=U.S. dollars 31 Unrealized gains or losses will be recorded in other comprehensive income and, once realized, the gains or losses will be recognized as an adjustment to revenue when the billings are recognized in revenue. A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates on Moody’s foreign exchange options. A hypothetical 10% favorable change in the overall option currency portfolio would result in a gain of approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2007. The maximum loss related to an adverse change in the option currency portfolio would be $2.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases through cash flow from operations and from financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $984.0 million, $752.5 million and $707.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The Company borrowed $847.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased by $231.5 million compared with 2006. A decrease in net income of $52.4 million reduced cash provided by operating activities. The increase in stock-based compensation expense positively impacted cash flow from operations by $13.1 million compared to net income. Accounts receivable decreased approximately 7% in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with an increase of approximately 13% for the year ended December 31, 2006 increasing cash flow from operations by $79.1 million compared to 2006. The impact on cash flows of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans decreased to $52.2 million from $103.2 million in 2006 due to fewer stock option exercises in 2007 compared with 2006. The favorable non-cash resolution of a legacy tax matter in the second quarter of 2007 negatively impacted operating cash flow by $52.3 million compared to net income. Operating cash flow in 2006 included a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Company’s former headquarters building. The $67.2 million reduction in cash flows from changes in other current assets is primarily due to the receipt of approximately $16 million from New D&B related to issuer-based stock compensation tax deductions in 2006 and an approximate $40 million overpayment of 2007 state income taxes offset by an $8.5 million increase related to a receivable from the IRS for a legacy tax matter classified as a current asset in 2007. Furthermore, the $55.5 million change in cash flows associated with other assets is primarily due to a deposit made in the first quarter of 2006 of approximately $40 million with the IRS relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating cash flow decreased by $87.5 million due to reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This is primarily due to a decrease in net accrued income taxes of approximately $76.5 million, decreases in accrued incentive compensation of approximately $27 million and decreases in accounts payable of approximately $17 million, due to timing of payments offset by approximately $33 million in restructuring liabilities. Increases in FIN No. 48 and other non-current tax and related liabilities increased cash flow from operations by approximately $83 million. Additionally, increases in the deferred rent liability contributed approximately $47 million to cash flow from operations relating primarily to the free rent period and tenant allowance on the 7WTC lease. Moody’s net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased by $44.6 million compared with 2005. Growth in net income contributed $193.1 million to cash provided by operating activities. The 2006 cash flows include a decrease relating to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans of $103.2 million that are now classified as a cash flow from financing activities as required under SFAS No. 123R. Prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006, excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation was presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow, along with other tax cash flows. The operating cash flow includes a decrease of $160.6 million from the gain on sale of the Company’s headquarters building. The cash proceeds are reported as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in accounts receivable is attributable to increases in revenue offset by improved collection. Additionally, Moody’s deposited approximately $40 million with the IRS in the first quarter of 2006 relating to Amortization Expense Deductions, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. This deposit was recorded in other assets. Tax payments increased by $53 million in 2006 versus 2005 offset by increases in income taxes payable due to growth in pre-tax net income. An increase in deferred revenue increased cash flow from operations by $28 million which is due to increased volume in annual and initial fees in both the ratings and research businesses. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($124.7) million, $116.1 million and ($150.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net maturities (investments) in short-term investments, net of purchases, totaled $61.5 million, $22.5 million and ($88.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures, primarily for leasehold improvements and internal use software, totaled $181.8 million, $31.1 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 increase relates primarily to the build-out of the Company’s new corporate headquarters at 7WTC. The 2006 spending on acquisitions 32 was $39.2 million, which related primarily to the purchase of a 49% share in China Cheng Xin International Credit Rating Co. Ltd and the acquisition of Wall Street Analytics, Inc., net of cash acquired. The 2005 spending on acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Economy.com, net of cash acquired, and a contingent payment made in the second quarter of 2005 related to Korea Investors Service. The net proceeds received from the sale of the Company’s former Corporate headquarters building in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $163.9 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $861.5 million, $965.2 million and $666.5 million for years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company borrowed $547.4 million under its commercial paper program in 2007 to support share repurchases, build-out of the new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and other operational activities. Additionally, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction $300.0 million aggregate principal Series 2007-1 Notes in the third quarter of 2007. Spending for share repurchases totaled $1,738.4 million, $1,093.6 million and $691.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Dividends paid were $85.2 million, $79.5 million and $60.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in dividends reflects a quarterly dividend paid of $0.08 per share 2007 versus a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in 2006 and $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in the subsequent quarters per share in 2005. These amounts were offset in part by proceeds from employee stock-based compensation plans of $65.9 million, $105.3 million and $89.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans were $52.2 million and $103.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decreases in proceeds from stock plans and the excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation plans is due primarily to a decrease in stock option exercise activity in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Future Cash Requirements The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow for fiscal year 2008. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company currently expects to use a significant portion of its cash flow to continue its share repurchase program. The Company implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. The Company’s intent is to return capital to shareholders in a way that serves their long-term interests. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The Company may borrow from various sources to fund share repurchases. On June 5, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program of which Moody’s has approximately $24 million remaining at December 31, 2007. On July 30, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase program that the Company will begin utilizing upon completion of the 2006 authority. There is no established expiration date for either of these authorizations. At December 31,2007 the Company had $551.9 million, net of unamortized discount of $0.7 million, of outstanding commercial paper and issued $300.0 million of 6.06% Series 2007-1 Notes, as described in the Indebtedness section below, to support share repurchases, the build-out of Moody’s new corporate headquarters at 7WTC and other operational activities. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the “Lease”) commencing on October 20, 2006 with 7 World Trade Center, LLC for 589,945 square-feet of an office building located at 7WTC at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, which is serving as Moody’s new headquarters. The Lease has an initial term of approximately 21 years with a total of 20 years of renewal options. The total base rent of the lease over its initial 21-year term is approximately $536 million including rent credits from the World Trade Center Rent Reduction Program promulgated by the Empire State Development Corporation. On March 28, 2007, the lease agreement was amended for the Company to lease an additional 78,568 square-feet at 7WTC. The additional base rent is approximately $106 million over a 20-year term. The Company plans to incur approximately $21 million of costs to complete the build-out its new corporate headquarters at 7WTC over the next year. On October 24, 2007, the Company announced a restructuring plan that would reduce global headcount, terminate certain technology contracts and consolidate certain corporate functions in response to the Company’s reorganization announced on August 7, 2007 and a decline in current and anticipated issuance of rated debt securities in some market sectors. Included in the $50.0 million restructuring charge is $7.0 million of non-cash settlements relating to pension curtailments and stock-based compensation award modifications for certain terminated employees. During 2007, the Company made cash payments of $1.8 million relating to the $43.0 million cash component of the restructuring liability and expects cash outlays of approximately $31 million and $2 million during 2008 and 2009, respectively. The remaining liability of $8.1 million relates to annuity payments that will be made in connection with the Company's 33 pension and other post-retirement benefit plans for certain terminated employees, which will commence when the employees reach retirement age beginning in 2009 and continue until all payments have been made. The Company also intends to use a portion of its cash flow to pay dividends. On December 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2008. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. The Company may also be required to make future cash outlays to pay to New D&B its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Contingencies”. These potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements, and they could cause the Company to pursue additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Indebtedness The following table summarizes total indebtedness as of December 31: 2007 2006 Notes payable: Senior notes, due 2015, 4.98% $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Senior notes, due 2017, 6.06% 300.0 — Commercial paper, net of unamortized discount of $0.7 million 551.9 — Total 1,151.9 300.0 Less: current portion (551.9 ) — Total long-term debt $ 600.0 $ 300.0 Notes Payable On September 7, 2007, the Company issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.06% Series 2007-1 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2017 (“Series 2007-1 Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement (“2007 Agreement”). The Series 2007-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.06%, payable semi-annually on March 7 and September 7 of each year. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, the Company may, from time to time within five years, in its sole discretion, issue additional series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million pursuant to one or more supplements to the 2007 Agreement. The Company may prepay the Series 2007-1 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium based on the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments, over the prepaid principal (“Make Whole Amount”). The 2007 Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: enter into transactions with affiliates, dispose of assets, incur or create liens, enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets. The Company must also not permit its total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. On September 30, 2005, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (“2005 Agreement”) and issued and sold through a private placement transaction, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2005-1 Senior Unsecured Notes (“Series 2005-1 Notes”). The Series 2005-1 Notes have a ten-year term and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.98%, payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. The proceeds from the sale of the Series 2005-1 Notes were used to refinance $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 7.61% Senior Notes which matured on September 30, 2005. In the event that Moody’s pays all, or part, of the Series 2005-1 Notes in advance of their maturity (the “Prepaid Principal”), such prepayment will be subject to a penalty based on the Make Whole Amount. The Series 2005-1 Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreements. 34 Commercial Paper On October 3, 2007, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (the “Program”) on a private placement basis under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion. Amounts available under the Program may be re-borrowed. The Program is supported by the Company’s 2007 Facility (see Credit Facilities section below), if at any time funds are not available on favorable terms under the Program. The maturities of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of the issuance. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”); (e) prime rate; (f) treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement. The Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; violation of covenants; invalidity of any loan document; material judgments; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. Credit Facilities On September 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2007 Facility”), expiring in September 2012, which replaces both the $500.0 million Interim Facility, which was set to expire in February 2008 as well as the $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility entered into on September 1, 2004 and scheduled to expire in September 2009. The 2007 Facility will serve, in part, to support the commercial paper program discussed above. Interest on borrowings is payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 16.0 to 40.0 basis points of the facility amount depending on the Company’s ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA (“Earnings Coverage Ratio”). The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the 2007 Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2007 Facility can range from 4.0 to 10.0 basis points of the facility amount, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeds 50% of the total facility. The 2007 Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, without the approval of the lenders, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and sale-leaseback transactions or to incur liens, as defined in the related agreement. The 2007 Facility also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain an Earnings Coverage Ratio of not more than 4.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the 2007 Facility. On August 8, 2007, the Company entered into an interim loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million that was to expire on February 8, 2008 (the “Interim Facility”). Interest on borrowings was payable at rates that were based on LIBOR plus a premium that could range from 17.0 to 47.5 basis points of the Interim Facility amount, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio. The Company also paid quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Interim Facility. The quarterly fees ranged from 8.0 to 15.0 basis points, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio. On September 28, 2007, the closing date of 2007 Facility, the Company terminated the Interim Facility and repaid the $100.0 million outstanding balance. On September 1, 2004, Moody’s entered into a five-year senior, unsecured bank revolving credit facility (the “2004 Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $160.0 million that was scheduled to expire in September 2009. Interest on the borrowings under the 2004 Facility was payable at rates that are based on LIBOR plus a premium that can range from 17.0 to 47.5 basis points depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio, as defined in the related agreement. The Company also paid quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity. The quarterly fees ranged from 8.0 to 15.0 basis points of the facility amount, depending on the Company’s Earnings Coverage Ratio. The Company also paid a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding exceeded 50% of the total facility. In October 2006, Moody’s amended the 2004 Facility by increasing the limit on sale proceeds resulting from a sale-leaseback transaction of its former corporate headquarters building from $150.0 million to $250.0 million. Additionally, the restriction on liens to secure indebtedness related to the building sale was also increased from $150.0 million to $250.0 million. The Company also increased the expansion feature of the 2004 Facility from $80.0 million to $340.0 million, subject to obtaining commitments for the incremental capacity at the time of draw down from the existing lenders. In April 2007, after receipt of all necessary approvals relating to the execution of the expansion feature, borrowing capacity under the 2004 Facility was increased to $500.0 million. On September 28, 2007, the closing date of the 2007 Facility, the Company terminated the 2004 Facility and repaid the $400.0 million outstanding balance. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within the note agreements and the 2007 Facility described above. 35 Interest (expense) income, net Interest (expense) income, net consists of: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Income $ 19.3 $ 18.2 $ 26.0 Expense on borrowings (40.7 ) (15.2 ) (21.0 ) Expense on FIN No. 48 tax liabilities (21.5 ) — — Reversal of interest (a) 17.5 — — Capitalized 1.1 — — Interest (expense) income, net $ (24.3 ) $ 3.0 $ 5.0 (a) Represents a reversal of accrued interest related to the favorable resolution of a legacy tax matter, as further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest paid on all borrowings was $32.5 million, $14.9 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchase and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Moody’s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities where Moody’s is the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, Moody’s is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. Contractual Obligations The following table presents payments due under the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less Than 1Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over 5Years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 1,071.1 $ 72.6 $ 113.7 $ 105.3 $ 779.5 Notes payable (2) 910.6 33.2 66.2 66.2 745.0 Purchase obligations (3) 39.0 30.1 7.9 1.0 — Borrowings under commercial paper program (4) 552.6 552.6 — — — Capital lease obligations 4.5 1.7 2.8 — — Other (5) 59.9 2.6 12.1 9.2 36.0 Total (6) $ 2,637.7 $ 692.8 $ 202.7 $ 181.7 $ 1,560.5 (1) Includes rent payments relating to the 165,000 square foot, 17.5 year operating lease agreement entered into on February 6, 2008 to occupy six floors of an office tower in the Canary Wharf section of London, England. The Company will begin making rent payments in March 2011. (2) Includes $9.3 million of accrued interest as of December 31, 2007 and $301.3 million of interest that will accrue and be due from January 1, 2008 through September 30, 2015 and 2017, when the Series 2005-1 Notes and the Series 2007-1 Notes mature, respectively. (3) Purchase obligations include approximately $21 million, excluding approximately $0.8 million of accrued liabilities, related to the build-out of Moody’s new corporate headquarters at 7WTC. Purchase obligations also include contracts for professional services, data processing and telecommunication services, and data back-up facilities. (4) Includes $1.3 million of interest related to CP Notes outstanding under its commercial paper program at December 31, 2007 that will be due and paid at various times through December 31, 2008. As of February 27, 2008, the Company had approximately $746 million of CP Notes outstanding under the Program. See “Indebtedness” for further information. 36 (5) Includes $59.9 million of projected benefit payments relating to the Company’s unfunded Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. (6) The table above does not include the Company’s net long-term tax liabilities of $118.3 million, since the expected cash outflow of such amounts by period cannot be reasonably estimated. 2008 Outlook Beginning in January 2008, Moody’s segments were changed to reflect the business reorganization announced in August 2007. As a result of the reorganization, the rating agency remains in the Moody’s Investors Service (“MIS”) operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned. All of Moody’s other commercial activities, including Moody’s KMV and sales of MIS research, are now combined under a new operating company known as Moody’s Analytics. Moody’s new initiatives in fixed income pricing and valuations will also be captured within Moody’s Analytics. Moody’s outlook for 2008 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer spending, residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity, securitization levels and capital markets issuance. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ from our current outlook. For Moody’s overall, full-year 2008 revenue is expected to decline in the low double-digit percent range. This decline assumes foreign currency translation in 2008 at current exchange rates. The Company anticipates a weak first half of 2008 with improvement in market liquidity and issuance conditions later in the year. Under this scenario, Moody’s first half 2008 performance is likely to reflect unusually weak market conditions, as well as challenging year-on-year comparisons against the first half of 2007 when the Company delivered record performance. The Company expects the full-year 2008 operating margin to decline to the mid- to high-forties percent range, due primarily to lower ratings revenue. Full-year expenses are expected to decrease approximately 5%, primarily due to the 2007 restructuring charge of $50.0 million, as well as expense savings from the restructuring actions, partially offset by investments in the growth areas of our business. Earnings per share for 2008 are projected in a range from $2.17 to $2.25, which reflects the estimated impact of share buy-backs under the Company’s share repurchase program. For the global Moody’s Investors Service business, the Company expects revenue for the full year 2008 to decline in the mid-to high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., the Company projects Moody’s Investors Service revenue to decrease in the mid-twenties percent range for the full year 2008. In the U.S. structured finance business, Moody’s expects revenue for the year to decline in the low- to mid-forties percent range, reflecting double-digit percent declines in most asset classes, led by residential mortgage-backed securities and credit derivatives ratings. In the U.S. corporate finance business, the Company expects revenue to decrease in the low-teens percent range for the year driven by declines across all asset classes. In both the U.S. financial institutions and public, project and infrastructure finance sectors, Moody’s projects revenue in 2008 to grow in the low single-digit percent range. Outside the U.S. the Company expects Moody’s Investors Service revenue to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. Good growth from rating financial institutions; public, project and infrastructure finance; and corporate securities is expected to be more than offset by a decline in structured finance ratings revenue, primarily in Europe. For Moody’s Analytics, the Company expects revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range. In the U.S., growth is projected to be in the low-teens percent range while outside the U.S., revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Growth in the subscription businesses is expected in the mid-teens range, reflecting continued demand for credit and economic research, structured finance analytics, and the impact of our newly formed pricing and valuation business. In the consulting business, Moody’s anticipates very strong growth, reflecting a robust pipeline of professional services engagements and credit training projects. There is considerable demand for Moody’s expertise in credit education, risk modeling, and scorecard development as customers implement more sophisticated risk management processes and comply with regulatory requirements. In the software business, the Company expects revenue to be flat versus 2007, as customers begin to migrate to new generation software platforms. 37 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements and applies only to those measurements that are already required or permitted to be measured at fair value by other accounting standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 (“FSP FAS 157-2), which partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company has implemented the deferral provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 and as a result has partially implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008. The partial implementation of SFAS 157 does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations and the Company will apply, as of January 1, 2009, the provisions of SFAS No, 157 to its non financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination and not subsequently remeasured at fair value, non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value for a goodwill impairment assessment, nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for an asset impairment assessment, and asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS No. 159, a company may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. Items eligible for fair-value election include recognized financial assets and liabilities such as equity-method investments and investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, written loan commitments, and certain warranties and insurance contracts where a warrantor or insurer is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, the election must be applied to individual instruments with certain restrictions, is irrevocable and must be applied to an entire instrument. Any upfront costs and fees related to the item elected for fair value must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred. At the implementation date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the implementation of SFAS No. 159, changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2008. The Company is currently determining the impact, if any, that the implementation of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (“SFAS No.141R”). SFAS No. 141R extends its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses and establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also expands disclosure requirements to improve the statement users’ abilities to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is required to be implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing SFAS No. 141R will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS No.160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners and requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is required to be implemented by the Company as of January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing SFAS No. 160 will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Contingencies From time to time, Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by Moody’s. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies based upon the latest information available. 38 Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings, other than routine litigation incidental to Moody’s business, material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate. For matters, except those related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When sufficient uncertainties exist, related to the outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly. For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of FIN No. 48, implemented as of January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained, based on its technical merits, as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities and is cooperating with those inquiries. Based on its review of the latest information available, and subject to the contingencies described below, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability of the Company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings, claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it is possible that the effect could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Legacy Contingencies Moody’s continues to have exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the 2000 Distribution (“Legacy Contingencies”). The following description of the relationships among Moody’s, New D&B and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the Legacy Contingencies that relate to tax matters (“Legacy Tax Matters”). In November 1996, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into three separate public companies: The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, ACNielsen Corporation and Cognizant Corporation (“Cognizant”). In June 1998, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation separated into two separate public companies: Old D&B and R.H. Donnelley Corporation. During 1998, Cognizant separated into two separate public companies: IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS Health”) and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. (“NMR”). In September 2000, Old D&B separated into two separate public companies: New D&B and Moody’s, as further described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Old D&B and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business, including through tax-free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations. These initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities. Old D&B and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable IRS rulings on certain tax matters, and certain other potential tax liabilities, all as described in such agreements. Further, in connection with the 2000 Distribution and pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, New D&B and Moody’s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to Legacy Tax Matters. Settlement agreements were executed with the IRS in 2005 regarding Legacy Tax Matters for the years 1989-1990 and 1993-1996. As of December 31, 2007, the Company continues to carry a liability of $1.8 million with respect to these matters. With respect to these settlement agreements, Moody’s and New D&B believe that IMS Health and NMR did not pay their full share of the liability to the IRS pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties. Moody’s and New D&B paid these amounts to the IRS on their behalf, and have been unable to resolve this dispute with IMS Health and NMR. As a result, Moody’s and New D&B have commenced arbitration proceedings against IMS Health and NMR to collect a total of approximately $11 million owed by IMS Health and NMR with respect to the 1989-1990 matter. Moody’s and New D&B may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect a total of $14.5 million owed by IMS Health and NMR with respect to the 1993-1996 matter. Moody’s cannot predict the outcome of these matters with any certainty. Amortization Expense Deductions and 1997-2002 IRS Deficiency Notices (the “Notices”) This legacy tax matter, which was affected by developments in June 2007 as further described below, involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of Old D&B since 1997. IRS audits of Old D&B’s and New D&B’s tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 concluded in June 2007 without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions, or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership 39 transaction. These audits did result in the IRS issuing the Notices for other tax issues for the 1997-2000 years aggregating $9.5 million in tax and penalties, plus statutory interest of approximately $7 million, which will be apportioned among Moody’s, New D&B, IMS Health and NMR pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements. Moody’s share of this assessment is anticipated to be $7.2 million including interest, net of tax. In November 2007, the IRS assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment, together with interest. The Company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the IRS’s actions and is evaluating its alternatives for further actions to recover these amounts The absence of any tax deficiencies in the Notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years 1997 through 2000 and in companion Notices of Deficiency issued to New D&B for 2001 and 2002, combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for 1997 through 2002, for issues not assessed, resulted in Moody’s recording an earnings benefit of $52.3 million in its second quarter. This is comprised of two components, as follows: (i) a reversal of a tax liability of $27.3 million related to the period from 1997 through the Distribution Date, reducing the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007; and (ii) a reduction of accrued interest expense of $17.5 million ($10.6 million, net of tax) and an increase in other non-operating income of $14.4 million, relating to amounts due to New D&B, for the year ended December 31, 2007. On the Distribution Date in 2000, New D&B paid Moody’s $55.0 million for 50% of certain anticipated future tax benefits of New D&B through 2012. It is possible that IRS audits of New D&B for tax years after 2002 could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction. In the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by New D&B, or there is an audit adjustment, Moody’s would be required, pursuant to the terms of the 2000 Distribution Agreement, to repay to New D&B an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that New D&B incurs . As of December 31, 2007, Moody’s liability with respect to this matter totaled $52.8 million. In March 2006, New D&B and Moody’s each deposited $39.8 million with the IRS in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the 1997 through 2002 tax years. In July 2007, New D&B and Moody’s commenced procedures to recover approximately $56 million of these deposits ($24.4 million for New D&B and $31.6 million for Moody’s), which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the Notices and in companion Statutory Notices of Deficiency issued to New D&B for 2001 and 2002. As noted above, in November 2007 the IRS used $7.9 million of Moody’s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest. Additionally, in January 2008 the IRS paid Moody’s $8.5 million in connection with this matter. At December 31, 2007, Moody’s has recorded liabilities for Legacy Tax Matters totaling $56.7 million. This includes liabilities and accrued interest due to New D&B arising from the 2000 Distribution Agreement. It is possible that the ultimate liability for Legacy Tax Matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the Company, which could result in additional charges that may be material to Moody’s future reported results, financial position and cash flows. Dividends During 2007, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share in each of the quarters of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.32 during the year. During 2006, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share in each of the quarters of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.28 during the year. During 2005, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 in the first quarter and $0.055 in each of the three subsequent quarters, per share of Moody’s common stock, resulting in dividends paid per share of $0.2025 during the year. On December 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share of Moody’s common stock, payable on March 10, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2008. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. 40 Common Stock Information The Company’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MCO”.
