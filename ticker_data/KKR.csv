1404912,KKR,KKR & Co. Inc.,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements of KKR & Co. L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated and combined financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, we are a leading global investment firm with $61.0 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2010 and a 34-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. When our founders started our firm in 1976, they established the principles that guide our business approach today, including a patient and disciplined investment process; the alignment of our interests with those of our investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders; and a focus on attracting world class talent. Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and our clients. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 185 private equity investments with a total transaction value in excess of $435 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as fixed income, capital markets, infrastructure and natural resources. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on servicing our existing investors and have invested meaningfully in developing relationships with new investors. We conduct our business through 14 offices on four continents, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. We have grown our AUM significantly, from $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2004 to $61.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 26.1%. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our investors and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. We seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these 75 Table of Contents aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. Business Segments Private Markets Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. These investment funds and co-investment vehicles are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a registered investment adviser. We also manage investments in infrastructure and in natural resources. Public Markets Through our Public Markets segment, we manage a specialty finance company, a number of investment funds, structured finance vehicles and separately managed accounts that invest capital in liquid credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, and less liquid credit products such as mezzanine debt and special situations investments. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by KKR Asset Management LLC (which we refer to as ""KAM""), an SEC registered investment adviser. We intend to continue to grow this business by leveraging our global investment platform, experienced investment professionals and the ability to adapt our investment strategies to different market conditions to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at every level of the capital structure and across market cycles. Capital Markets and Principal Activities Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines the assets we acquired in the Combination Transaction with our global capital markets business. Our capital markets business supports our firm, our portfolio companies and our clients by providing tailored capital markets advice and developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments and companies seeking financing. Our capital markets services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings, structuring new investment products and providing capital markets services. To allow us to carry out these activities, we are registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe and Asia. The assets that we acquired in the Combination Transaction, which include investments in our private equity funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide us with a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing portfolio of businesses and further align our interests with those of our investors and other stakeholders. We believe that the market experience and skills of professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of professionals in our Private Markets and Public Markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this asset base over time. Business Environment As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the world. Global equity markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as equity prices significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. For our private equity investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. For other private equity investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value. In addition, the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings, or IPOs, as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. During 2010, we completed IPOs of three portfolio companies: NXP 76 Table of Contents Semiconductors N.V. (Nasdaq: NXPI), China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (HKG: 1117), and TDC (OMX: TDC). Global equity markets carried positive momentum from the third quarter of 2010 through the end of the year. Against a stronger, yet still mixed economic backdrop, equity prices rallied as robust corporate earnings and improving investor sentiment outweighed concerns over lingering weak economic indicators such as unemployment and housing prices. The S&P 500 gained 10.8% in the fourth quarter and finished 2010 up 15.1% for the full year. Global equity markets were similarly strong, with the MSCI World Index up 9.1% and 12.3% for the fourth quarter and full year 2010, respectively. The below investment grade credit markets also performed well, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan index increasing 3.2% and 10.1% for the fourth quarter and full year 2010, respectively, and the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index increasing 3.1% and 15.2% over the same periods. Conditions in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity transactions. Similarly, our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness. To the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and, therefore, our investment returns on our funds. In addition, during economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth, the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt (and thereby extend our investment holding period) can be significant to our ability to realize investment gains from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve. Our Public Markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit products, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and mezzanine debt. As a result, conditions in global credit markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on favorable terms in the future. In addition, our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. As a result, the conditions in global equity and credit markets impacts both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment. Finally, conditions in commodity markets may impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways, including through direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. Reorganization and Combination Transactions Prior to October 1, 2009, KKR's business was conducted through multiple entities for which there was no single holding entity, but were under common control of senior KKR principals (""Senior Principals""), and in which Senior Principals and KKR's other principals and individuals held ownership interests (collectively, the ""Predecessor Owners""). In order to facilitate the Combination Transaction, KKR completed the Reorganization Transactions, pursuant to which KKR's business was reorganized under two partnerships, KKR Management Holdings L.P. and KKR Fund Holdings L.P., which are collectively referred to as the ""KKR Group Partnerships."" The reorganization involved a contribution of certain equity interests in KKR's businesses that were held by KKR's Predecessor Owners to the KKR Group Partnerships in exchange for 100% of the interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. On October 1, 2009, KKR & Co. L.P. and KPE, completed the Combination Transaction to combine the investment management business of KKR with the assets and liabilities of KPE. The Combination Transaction involved the contribution of all of KPE's assets and liabilities to the KKR 77 Table of Contents Group Partnerships in exchange for a 30% interest in the KKR Group Partnerships. Upon completion of the Combination Transaction, KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P. and was traded publicly on Euronext Amsterdam under the symbol ""KKR"" until the NYSE listing on July 15, 2010. We refer to the Reorganization Transaction and Combination Transaction together as the ""Transactions."" Immediately following the Transactions, KKR Guernsey held a 30% economic interest in the KKR Group Partnerships through Group Holdings and our principals retained a 70% economic interest in the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Holdings. U.S. Listing On July 15, 2010, KKR & Co. L.P. became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""). In connection with the NYSE listing, KKR Guernsey contributed its 30% interest held through Group Holdings to KKR & Co. L.P. in exchange for NYSE-listed common units of KKR & Co. L.P. and distributed those common units to holders of KKR Guernsey units (referred to hereafter as the ""In-Kind Distribution""). Because the assets of KKR Guernsey consisted solely of its interests in Group Holdings, the In-Kind Distribution resulted in the dissolution of KKR Guernsey and the delisting of its units from Euronext Amsterdam. As of July 15, 2010, KKR & Co. L.P. both indirectly controlled the KKR Group Partnerships and indirectly held KKR Group Partnership units representing at that time a 30% economic interest in KKR's business. The remaining 70% of the KKR Group Partnership units were held by KKR's principals through KKR Holdings. Subsequent to the NYSE listing, KKR Holdings and our principals exchanged a portion of their interests in the KKR Group Partnerships for common units, and as of December 31, 2010, KKR & Co. L.P. owned 31.15% of the KKR Group Partnership units and our principals owned 68.85% through KKR Holdings. From time to time, the percentage ownership in the KKR Group Partnerships may continue to change as KKR Holdings and/or KKR's principals exchange KKR Group Partnership Units for KKR & Co. L.P. common units. Basis of Financial Presentation The consolidated and combined financial statements include the accounts of our management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated co-investment vehicles and the general partners of our private equity and fixed income funds and their respective consolidated funds, where applicable. As of December 31, 2010, our private markets segment included eight consolidated investment funds and ten unconsolidated co-investment vehicles. Our public markets segment included five consolidated investment funds and six unconsolidated vehicles comprised of three investment funds, two separately managed accounts and one specialty finance company. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), a substantial number of our funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we hold only a minority economic interest in those funds. The majority of our consolidated funds consist of those funds in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds. With respect to our consolidated funds, we generally have operational discretion and control over the funds and investors do not hold any substantive rights that would enable them to impact the funds' ongoing governance and operating activities. When a fund is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated fund on a gross basis. The majority of the economic interests in the consolidated fund, which are held by third party investors, are reflected as noncontrolling interests. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests in 78 Table of Contents consolidated entities on the statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the statements of operations. Historically, the noncontrolling interests attributable to the ownership of KPE's investment partnership, KKR PEI Investments, L.P., by KPE were included in our financial statements. These noncontrolling interests were removed from the financial statements on October 1, 2009, because these interests were contributed to KKR in the Transactions. Subsequent to the Transactions, KKR holds 100% of the economic and controlling interests in KPE's investment partnership. Therefore, we continue to consolidate KPE's investment partnership and its economic interests are no longer reflected as noncontrolling interests as of the date of the Transactions. Key Financial Measures Fees Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring and transaction fees from providing advisory and other services to our portfolio companies, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance vehicles, and separately managed accounts, and (iii) fees from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements. A substantial portion of monitoring and transaction fees earned in connection with managing portfolio companies are shared with fund investors. Fees reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements do not include the management fees that we earn from consolidated funds, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. However, because those management fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds, net income attributable to KKR is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. Expenses Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, equity based compensation and profit sharing plans as described below. Prior to October 1, 2009, our employee compensation and benefits expense has consisted of base salaries and bonuses paid to employees who were not our Senior Principals. Payments made to our Senior Principals included partner distributions that were paid to our Senior Principals and accounted for as capital distributions rather than employee compensation and benefits expense. Accordingly, we did not record any employee compensation and benefits charges for payments made to our Senior Principals for periods prior to the completion of the Transactions. Following the completion of the Transactions, all of our Senior Principals and other personnel receive a base salary that is paid by us and accounted for as employee compensation and benefits expense. Our employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, our overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are funded by us and result in customary employee compensation and benefits charges, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of our most senior personnel are funded by KKR Holdings with distributions that it receives on its KKR Group Partnership Units. Any distributions received by KKR Holdings in excess of amounts that principals are otherwise entitled to through their vested interests in KKR Holdings are reflected in compensation expense in the statement of operations. KKR Holdings has also funded all of the equity and equity based awards that have been granted to our employees to date. 79 Table of Contents In connection with and subsequent to the Transactions, our principals and other employees received equity and equity based awards in KKR Holdings. The awards were granted in connection with the Transactions and were issued in exchange for interests that our Predecessor Owners contributed to our holding companies as part of the Transactions as well as to promote broad ownership of our firm among our personnel and further align their interests with those of our investors. We believe that grants to our principals and other employees, which include vested and unvested interests in the KKR Group Partnerships, provide an additional means for allowing us to incentivize, motivate and retain qualified professionals that will help us continue to grow our business over the long-term. While we do not bear the economic costs associated with the equity and equity based grants that KKR Holdings has made to our personnel or the cash bonuses that it pays to any of our principals with distributions received on its KKR Group Partnership Units, we are required to recognize employee compensation and benefits expense with respect to a significant portion of these items. Because these amounts are funded by KKR Holdings and not by us, these expenses represent non-cash charges for us and do not impact our distributable earnings. We recognize non-cash charges relating to equity and equity based grants that are funded by KKR Holdings based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Awards that do not require the satisfaction of future service or performance criteria (vested awards) are expensed immediately. Awards that require the satisfaction of future service or performance criteria are expensed over the relevant service period, adjusted for the lack of distribution participation and estimated forfeitures of awards not expected to vest. We expect to record additional non-cash charges in future periods as and when interests in KKR Holdings vest and when new equity is granted. In addition, we are permitted to allocate to our principals, other professionals and selected other individuals a portion of the carried interest that we earn from our current and future funds that provide for carried interest payments. As and when investment income is recognized with respect to this carried interest, we record a corresponding amount of employee compensation and benefits expense. General, Administrative and Other Expense General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges and other general and operating expenses. In addition, interests in KKR Holdings were granted to our operating consultants in connection with and subsequent to the Transactions. The vesting of these interests gives rise to periodic general, administrative and other expense in the statements of operations. General, administrative and other expense recognized on unvested units is calculated based on the fair value of an interest in KKR Holdings (determined using the closing price of KKR's common units) on each reporting date and subsequently adjusted for the actual fair value of the award at each vesting date. Accordingly, the measured value of these interests will not be finalized until each vesting date. Additionally, the calculation of the compensation expense considers estimated forfeitures of awards not expected to vest. While we do not bear the economic costs associated with the equity and equity based grants that KKR Holdings has made to our operating consultants, we are required to recognize general, administrative and other expense with respect to a significant portion of these items. Because these amounts are funded by KKR Holdings and not by us, these expenses represent non-cash charges for us and do not impact our distributable earnings. General, administrative and other expense is not borne by fund investors and is not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. 80 Table of Contents Fund Expenses Fund expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions (such as travel expenses, professional fees and research costs) and other costs associated with administering our private equity funds. A substantial portion of fund expenses are borne by fund investors. Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global equity markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value of Investments."" Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that private equity funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. Private equity funds recognize dividend income primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances, principal assets and fixed income instruments in which consolidated funds invest. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from credit facilities entered into by KKR, Senior Notes issued by KKR, and debt outstanding at our consolidated funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns, which are not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or management companies. In addition to these interest costs, we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. Income Taxes Prior to the completion of the Transactions, we operated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and mainly as a corporate entity in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As a result, income was not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Historically, the tax liability related to income earned by us represented obligations of our principals and has not been reflected in the historical financial statements. Income taxes shown on the statements of operations prior to the Transactions are attributable to the New York City unincorporated business tax and other income taxes on certain entities located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 81 Table of Contents Following the Transactions, the KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries have continued to operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, continue to be subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes. However, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such wholly owned subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management Holdings Corp., and the KKR Group Partnerships, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. Subsequent to the Transactions, we use the liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to those interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. For periods prior to the Transactions, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of: •noncontrolling interests that third party investors held in consolidated funds; •noncontrolling interests attributable to the ownership of KPE's investment partnership by KPE's unitholders; •a noncontrolling interest that allocated to a third party an aggregate of approximately 2% of the equity in our capital markets business; and •noncontrolling interests that allocated 35% of the net income (loss) generated by the manager of our Public Markets segment to certain of its principals on an annual basis through May 30, 2008. On May 30, 2008, we acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests of KKR Asset Management LLC, the manager of our Public Markets segment, and now own 100% of this business. In connection with the Transactions, we acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests in KPE's investment partnership, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of KKR. For periods subsequent to the completion of the Transactions, noncontrolling interests include: •noncontrolling interests that third party investors hold in consolidated funds; •a noncontrolling interest that allocates to a third party approximately of approximately 2% of the equity in our capital markets business; 82 Table of Contents •noncontrolling interests that allocate to a former principal and such person's designees an aggregate of 1% of the carried interest received by general partners of our funds and 1% of our other profits until a future date; •noncontrolling interests that allocate to certain of our former principals and their designees a portion of the carried interest received by the general partners of the private equity funds with respect to private equity investments made during such former principals' tenure with us; •noncontrolling interests that allocate to certain of our current and former principals all of the capital invested by or on behalf of the general partners of the private equity funds before the completion of the Transactions and any returns thereon; and •noncontrolling interests representing the KKR Group Partnership Units that KKR Holdings holds in the KKR Group Partnerships, which interests were allocated on October 1, 2010 to KKR Holdings representing 70% of the equity in the KKR Group Partnerships at that time. Assets Under Management (""AUM"") AUM represents the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or carried interest and general partner capital. The AUM reported prior to the date of consummation of the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our investment funds. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our investment funds are excluded from our calculation of AUM. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's fixed income products; and (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles. You should note that KKR's calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other investment managers and, as a result, its measurements of AUM may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages. Fee Paying Assets Under Management (""FPAUM"") FPAUM represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. FPAUM reported prior to the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE is excluded from our calculation of FPAUM, because these assets are now owned by us and are no longer managed on behalf of a third-party investor. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest); and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. You should note that KKR's calculation of FPAUM may differ from the calculations of other investment managers and, as a result, its measurements of FPAUM may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. KKR's definition of FPAUM is not based on any definition of FPAUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages. Segment Results We present the results of our reportable business segments in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Section 280, Segment Reporting. This guidance is based on a management approach, which requires segment presentation based on internal organization and the internal financial reporting used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. All inter segment transactions are eliminated in the segment presentation. 83 Table of Contents Our management makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources based on financial and operating data and measures that are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of any of the funds that we manage. In addition, there are other components of our reportable segment results that differ from the equivalent GAAP results on a consolidated basis. These differences are described below. We believe such adjustments are meaningful because management makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of our business based on financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the consolidation of any funds. Segment Operating and Performance Measures Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings (""FRE"") is comprised of segment operating revenues, less segment operating expenses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a combined basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of expenses of consolidated funds; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income is composed of net carried interest and other investment income (loss). Carried interests entitle the general partner of our private equity funds to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces third party investors' share of those earnings. Carried interests are earned on realized and unrealized gains (losses) on fund investments as well as dividends received by our funds. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interests are included in investment income to the extent that cumulative investment returns in a given fund are positive. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interests will be reduced and reflected as investment losses. Gross carried interest is reduced for carry pool allocations and refunds of management fees payable upon the recognition of carried interest. Allocations to our carry pool represent approximately 40% of carried interest earned in funds and vehicles eligible to receive carry distributions to be allocated to our principals plus any allocation of carried interest to our other personnel as part of our profit sharing plan. No carry pool allocations are recorded in funds and vehicles that are in either a clawback position or a net loss sharing position and therefore carry pool allocations may not always equal 40% of gross carried interest. Prior to October 1, 2009, allocations to our carry pool consisted only of allocations to our employee profit sharing program. Certain of our investment funds require that we refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the management fees earned or a portion thereof, carried interest is reduced, not to exceed 20% of management fees earned. Other investment income (loss) is comprised of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and dividends on capital invested by the general partners of our funds and by us, as well as interest income and interest expense. Economic Net Income Economic net income (""ENI"") is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income, which is reduced for carry pool allocations and management fee refunds; less (iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income on a U.S. GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items 84 Table of Contents referred to in FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by our investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles during a given period. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which we are entitled to a carried interest and (ii) capital invested by us. Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments represents unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our consolidated and combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of operations of our three business segments in these periods, see ""—Segment Analysis."" The following tables set forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 ($ in thousands) Revenues Fees $ 435,386 $ 331,271 $ 235,181 Expenses Employee Compensation and Benefits 1,344,455 838,072 149,182 Occupancy and Related Charges 39,692 38,013 30,430 General, Administrative and Other 311,147 264,396 179,673 Fund Expenses 67,369 55,229 59,103 Total Expenses 1,762,663 1,195,710 418,388 Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 7,755,090 7,505,005 (12,944,720 ) Dividend Income 1,250,293 186,324 75,441 Interest Income 226,824 142,117 129,601 Interest Expense (53,099 ) (79,638 ) (125,561 ) Total Investment Income (Loss) 9,179,108 7,753,808 (12,865,239 ) Income (Loss) Before Taxes 7,851,831 6,889,369 (13,048,446 ) Income Taxes 75,360 36,998 6,786 Net Income (loss) 7,776,471 6,852,371 (13,055,232 ) Less: Net Income (loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities 6,544,016 6,119,382 (11,850,761 ) Less: Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in KKR Holdings L.P. 899,277 (116,696 ) — Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. $ 333,178 $ 849,685 $ (1,204,471 ) 85 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Fees were $435.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $104.1 million, or 31.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees relating to underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services of $71.2 million driven by an increase in the number of capital markets transactions during the period. In addition, there was a $57.4 million increase in gross transaction fees received from transaction fee-generating investments, reflecting an increase in the number of transaction fee-generating investments during the period. Incentive fees from KFN increased $34.4 million as a result of KFN's financial performance exceeding certain required benchmarks for each of the four quarters during the year ended December 31, 2010. KFN only earned an incentive fee in one quarter during the year ended December 31, 2009. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in monitoring fees of $55.2 million, primarily due to $72.2 million in fees received during the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, Dollar General Corporation and Avago Technologies Limited and partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in reimbursable expenses. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with initial public offering activity in our private equity portfolio. Expenses Expenses were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 47.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-cash equity based charges of $261.8 million associated with the issuance of interests in KKR Holdings to our principals, other employees and operating consultants as well as increases in the allocations to our carry pool of $278.7 million. The increase in allocations to our carry pool was due to (i) a higher level of gross carried interest recognized in 2010 and (ii) the allocation of a portion of carried interest to our carry pool for the full year in 2010 versus only one quarter in 2009. Allocations to the carry pool were not made prior to the Transactions on October 1, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, these items resulted in charges recorded in employee compensation and benefits relating to principals and other personnel amounting to $1.1 billion, and charges recorded in general, administrative, and other expense relating to operating consultants amounting to $143.7 million. In addition, other employee compensation and benefits expense, comprised primarily of salaries and incentive compensation, increased $29.7 million as a result of the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of our businesses, and transaction related expenses increased $10.1 million as a result of a higher level of unconsummated transactions during the period. Offsetting these increases was a decrease related to non-recurring charges of $34.8 million associated with the closing of the Transactions in the prior period. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 3.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 7,511,340 $ 7,375,947 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 243,750 129,058 Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,755,090 $ 7,505,005 86 Table of Contents The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for Private Equity Investments which illustrates the significant variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding significant gains and losses in our private equity portfolio. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Realized Gains $ 2,474,584 $ 299,721 Unrealized Losses from Sales of Investments and Realization of Gains(a) (2,484,878 ) (482,299 ) Realized Losses (122,876 ) (473,269 ) Unrealized Gains from Sales of Investments and Realization of Losses(b) 157,874 479,617 Unrealized Gains from Changes in Fair Value 10,010,038 9,696,213 Unrealized Losses from Changes in Fair Value (2,523,402 ) (2,144,036 ) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities—Private Equity Investments $ 7,511,340 $ 7,375,947 (a)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with realization events where such gains become realized. (b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. Dividend Income Dividend income was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to dividend income of $186.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $1.2 billion of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $42.6 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received $179.2 million of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $7.1 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. Interest Income Interest income was $226.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $84.7 million, compared to interest income of $142.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily reflects an increase in the level of fixed income instruments in our fixed income vehicles and our private equity portfolio. Interest Expense Interest expense was $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $26.5 million, compared to interest expense of $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings resulting from the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit agreements, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes during 2010. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, income before taxes was $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 14.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. 87 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities was $6.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 6.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the overall increase in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in KKR Holdings L.P. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in KKR Holdings was $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in KKR Holdings of $0.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily due to the change in net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Fees Fees were $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $96.1 million, or 40.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to a $50.5 million increase in transaction fees, from $41.3 million to $91.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively reflecting an increase in transaction-fee generating private equity investments during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed twelve transaction-fee generating transactions with a combined transaction value of $5.1 billion compared to four transaction-fee generating transactions with a combined transaction value of $4.5 billion in 2008. Transaction fees are negotiated separately for each completed transaction based on the services that we provide and will also vary depending on the nature of the investment being made. Monitoring fees increased $39.2 million reflecting the net impact of (i) an increase of $72.2 million relating to fees received for the termination of monitoring fee contracts in connection with public equity offerings of two of our portfolio companies, (ii) a decrease relating to the receipt in the prior period of a non-recurring $15.0 million advisory fee from one of our portfolio companies in connection with equity raised by that company, (iii) a $6.8 million net decrease in reimbursable expenses and (iv) a net decrease of $11.2 million in fees received from certain portfolio companies due primarily to a decline in the number of portfolio companies paying a fee and to a lesser extent lower average fees received. During the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding one time fees received from the termination of monitoring fee contracts, we had 30 portfolio companies that were paying an average fee of $2.9 million compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average fee of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, during 2009 fees were increased by a third quarter incentive fee of $4.5 million earned from KFN as a result of KFN's financial performance exceeding certain required benchmarks. No such fee was earned in the prior period. Expenses Expenses were $1,195.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $777.3 million, as compared to expenses of $418.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to non-cash charges associated with the issuance of interests in KKR Holdings to our principals and operating consultants. For the year ended December 31, 2009, non-cash employee compensation and benefits relating to principals amounted to $644.5 million, and non-cash charges recorded in general and administrative expenses relating to operating consultants amounted to $85.0 million. In addition, other employee compensation and benefits expenses increased $44.4 million due to (i) a $26.9 million increase in profit sharing costs in connection with an increase in the value of our private equity portfolio, (ii) an $11.7 million increase in salaries and other benefits reflecting the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the expansion of our business, and (iii) a $5.8 million increase in incentive compensation in connection with higher bonuses in 2009 reflecting improved overall financial performance of our management companies when compared to the prior period. The 88 Table of Contents remainder of the net increase in expenses is the result of the net impact of the following: (i) a $34.8 million non-recurring charge associated with the closing of the Transactions, (ii) an increase in occupancy costs of $7.6 million primarily reflecting the opening of new offices subsequent to December 31, 2008 as well as an increase in existing office space, (iii) a decrease in transaction related expenses attributable to unconsummated transactions during the period of $14.0 million, from $28.2 million to $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, and (iv) decreases in other operating expenses of $25.0 million reflecting expense reductions across the majority of our businesses. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $20.4 billion compared to net losses from investment activities of $12.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net gains (losses) from investment activities from the prior period was primarily attributable to net unrealized gains of $7.8 billion resulting primarily from increases in the market value of our investment portfolio during 2009 compared to net unrealized losses of $13.2 billion during 2008. This change in net unrealized gains and losses resulted in a net favorable variance in unrealized investment activity from the prior period of $21.0 billion. Offsetting the increase in unrealized gains (losses) was realization activity that represented a net loss for 2009 of $0.3 billion compared with a net gain of $0.3 billion for 2008, which resulted in a net unfavorable variance in realization activity from the prior period of $0.6 billion. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 ($ in thousands) Realized Gains $ 393,310 $ 446,856 Unrealized Losses from Sales of Investments and Realization of Gains(a) (498,839 ) (345,477 ) Realized Losses (707,717 ) (193,446 ) Unrealized Gains from Sales of Investments and Realization of Losses(b) 683,696 101,402 Unrealized Gains from Changes in Fair Value 9,831,344 2,681,711 Unrealized Losses from Changes in Fair Value (2,196,789 ) (15,635,766 ) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,505,005 $ (12,944,720 ) (a)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with realization events where such gains become realized. (b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. Dividend Income Dividend income was $186.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $110.9 million compared to dividend income of $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our dividends are generally earned in connection with sales of significant operations undertaken by our portfolio companies resulting in available cash that is distributed to our private equity funds. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received $179.2 million of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $7.1 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we received $74.2 million of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $1.2 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. 89 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $142.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $12.5 million, or 9.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily reflects an increase of $38.1 million at one of our fixed income vehicles resulting from a higher average level of debt investments during the period. Offsetting this increase was (i) a decrease of $19.9 million at the KPE Investment Partnership due to a decrease in interest income-yielding investments, (ii) a $2.0 million decrease as a result of the exclusion of the general partners of the 1996 Fund in the fourth quarter of 2009, which interests were not contributed to the KKR Group Partnerships in connection with the Transactions, and (iii) a $3.7 million decrease at our management companies and private equity funds resulting from lower average cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense was $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 a decrease of $45.9 million, or 36.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. Average outstanding borrowings remained unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2008, however the weighted average interest rate was lower during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year period. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, income before taxes was $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $19.9 billion compared to loss before taxes of $13.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities was $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $18.0 billion compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities of $11.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Segment Analysis The following is a discussion of the results of our three reportable business segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Basis of Financial Presentation—Segment Results"" and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing. 90 Table of Contents Private Markets Segment The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Private Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 ($ in thousands) Fees Management and Incentive Fees: Management Fees $ 396,227 $ 415,207 $ 396,394 Incentive Fees — — — Total Management and Incentive Fees 396,227 415,207 396,394 Net Monitoring and Transaction Fees: Monitoring Fees 86,932 158,243 97,256 Transaction Fees 96,000 57,699 23,096 Total Fee Credits (52,563 ) (73,900 ) (12,698 ) Net Transaction and Monitoring Fees 130,369 142,042 107,654 Total Fees 526,596 557,249 504,048 Expenses Employee Compensation and Benefits 159,561 147,801 135,204 Occupancy and Related Charges 36,395 34,747 27,665 Other Operating Expenses 148,357 134,610 185,027 Total Expenses 344,313 317,158 347,896 Fee Related Earnings 182,283 240,091 156,152 Investment Income (Loss) Gross Carried interest 1,202,070 826,193 (1,197,387 ) Less: Allocation to KKR carry pool (453,872 ) (57,971 ) 8,156 Less: Management fee refunds (143,446 ) (22,720 ) 29,611 Net carried interest 604,752 745,502 (1,159,620 ) Other investment income (loss) (1,643 ) 128,528 (230,053 ) Total Investment Income (Loss) 603,109 874,030 (1,389,673 ) Income (Loss) before Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 785,392 1,114,121 (1,233,521 ) Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 839 497 — Economic Net Income $ 784,553 $ 1,113,624 $ (1,233,521 ) Assets under management (period end) $ 46,223,900 $ 38,842,900 $ 35,283,700 Fee paying assets under management (period end) $ 38,186,700 $ 36,484,400 $ 39,244,700 Committed Dollars Invested $ 4,555,700 $ 2,107,700 $ 3,168,800 Uncalled Commitments (period end) $ 12,625,900 $ 13,728,100 $ 14,930,142 91 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Fees were $526.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $30.7 million, or 5.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a $71.3 million decrease in gross monitoring fees. This decrease was primarily due to the absence in 2010 of $72.2 million in fees received during the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, Dollar General Corporation and Avago Technologies Limited. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with initial public offering activity in our private equity portfolio. In addition, management fees decreased $19.0 million resulting primarily from the net impact of the following: (i) a $28.2 million decrease in management fees as fees which were previously earned from KPE have been eliminated as a result of the Transactions on October 1, 2009; (ii) a decrease of $10.9 million primarily relating to fee paying capital that was transferred from a fee paying private equity fund (European Fund III) to a non-fee paying private equity fund (E2 Investors) subsequent to September 30, 2009; (iii) a $5.4 million net decrease due primarily to a reduction in fee paying capital at our private equity funds in connection with realization activity offset by new fee paying capital raised; and (iv) an increase of $25.5 million associated with a reduction in waived management fees during 2010. The net decrease in fees was partially offset by (i) an increase in gross transaction fees of $38.3 million primarily reflecting an increase in the number of transaction fee-generating investments during the period and (ii) a $21.3 million decrease in credits earned by limited partners under fee sharing arrangements in our private equity funds due primarily to the decline in gross transaction and monitoring fees. Expenses Expenses were $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $27.2 million, or 8.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other operating expenses of $13.7 million primarily reflecting an increase in transaction related expenses of $10.1 million attributable to unconsummated transactions during the period. In addition, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $11.8 million reflecting the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of our business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $57.8 million, or 24.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to the decline in fees and increase in expenses described above. Investment Income Investment income was $603.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $270.9 million, or 31.0%, compared to investment income of $874.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by certain adjustments related to the Combination Transaction that were applicable for the full year of 2010 versus only one quarter in 2009, including (i) the exclusion of carried interest from the 1996 Fund, (ii) the exclusion of carried interest allocated to certain of our former principals, (iii) the allocation of a portion of carried interest to the carry pool, and (iv) the exclusion of investment gains and losses on capital invested by or on behalf of the general partners of our private equity funds. For the year ended December 31, 2010, investment income (loss) included (i) net carried interest of $604.8 million and (ii) other investment income (loss) of $(1.6) million, which was comprised primarily of losses from unfavorable changes in foreign 92 Table of Contents exchange rates. The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 420,574 $ (44,136 ) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 593,971 835,028 Dividends and Interest 187,525 35,301 Gross carried interest 1,202,070 826,193 Less: Allocation to KKR carry pool (453,872 ) (57,971 ) Less: Management fee refunds (143,446 ) (22,720 ) Net carried interest $ 604,752 $ 745,502 Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists primarily of the sales of East Resources Inc. and Eastman Kodak Company, and partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Avago Technologies Limited. Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2009 consists primarily of the write-off of our investment in Masonite International, Inc., offset by realized gains on initial public offerings of Avago Technologies Limited and Dollar General Corporation. The following table presents net unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest by fund for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) 2006 Fund $ 216,594 $ 203,762 Asian Fund 170,526 22,422 Millennium Fund 73,098 380,054 European Fund 70,091 123,834 Co-Investment Vehicles 40,926 57,183 European Fund III 21,768 — E2 Investors 968 — 1996 Fund(a) — 47,773 Total(a) $ 593,971 $ 835,028 (a)The above table excludes any funds for which there were no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest during either of the periods presented. In addition, subsequent to the Transactions, the 1996 Fund was no longer included in our results and therefore no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest attributable to the 1996 Fund are included for the year ended December 31, 2010 or the three months ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 33% of net unrealized gains from changes in value were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the net unrealized gains from changes in value, the most significant of which were HCA Inc. (healthcare sector), Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector) and US Foodservice (retail sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 40% of unrealized gains were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO), Sealy 93 Table of Contents Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ROC). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the unrealized gains, the most significant of which were HCA Inc. (healthcare sector), KKR Debt Investors S.a.r.l. (financial services sector), and Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector). In addition, there was a significant unrealized gain due to the reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss in connection with the write-off of our investment in Masonite International Inc. (manufacturing sector) when the loss became realized. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists primarily of dividends earned from HCA Inc. (healthcare sector) and Visant Inc. (media sector). Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. The amount of carried interest earned during the year ended December 31, 2010 for those funds and vehicles eligible to receive carried interest amounted to $1.1 billion, of which the carry pool was allocated approximately 40% and the remaining portion was allocated to KKR and KKR Holdings based on their respective ownership percentages. Management fee refunds amounted to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily reflecting the 2006 Fund becoming carry-earning in 2010. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $784.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $329.1 million compared to economic net income of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in investment income described above was the main contributor to the period over period decline in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 AUM $ 38,842,900 New Capital Raised 3,025,500 Distributions (4,085,200 ) Foreign Exchange (274,800 ) Change in Value 8,715,500 December 31, 2010 AUM $ 46,223,900 AUM in our Private Markets segment was $46.2 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $7.4 billion, or 19.0%, compared to $38.8 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to $8.7 billion of net unrealized gains resulting from changes in the market values of our private equity portfolio companies, as well as $3.0 billion of new capital raised. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity funds were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.2 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.8 billion in our 2006 Fund, Millennium Fund, European Fund II, Asian Fund and European Fund, respectively. Approximately 40% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly listed investments, notably increases in Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI), which was taken public during the third quarter of 2010. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to HCA Inc. (healthcare sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by significant unrealized losses related to Energy Future 94 Table of Contents Holdings Corp. (energy sector) and U.N Ro-Ro (transportation sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Partially offsetting these increases were distributions from our funds totaling $4.1 billion, which was comprised of $3.3 billion of realized gains and $0.8 billion of return of original cost. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2009 to December 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 36,484,400 New Capital Raised 2,971,600 Distributions (650,300 ) Foreign Exchange (658,800 ) Change in Value 39,800 December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 38,186,700 FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $38.2 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 4.7%, compared to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to new fee paying capital raised during 2010, including $0.9 billion for our China Growth Fund and $1.1 billion for an infrastructure separately managed account. The increase was partially offset by distributions of $0.7 billion and a $0.7 billion decrease related to foreign exchange adjustments on foreign denominated commitments and invested capital. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2009. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2010 our Private Markets segment had $12.6 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investment in new transactions. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Fees Fees in our Private Markets segment were $557.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $53.2 million, or 10.6%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to a $34.4 million increase in net transaction and monitoring fees. Transaction fees are negotiated separately for each completed transaction based on the services that we provide and will also vary depending on the nature of the investment being made. The increase in net transaction and monitoring fees was primarily the result of (i) an increase in gross transaction fees of $34.6 million reflecting an increase in transaction-fee generating private equity investments during the period (we completed twelve transaction-fee generating transactions with a combined transaction value of $5.1 billion in 2009 compared to four transaction-fee generating transactions in 2008 with a combined transaction value of $4.5 billion); (ii) an increase in gross monitoring fees of $61.0 million reflecting the net impact of an increase of $72.2 million relating to fees received for the termination of monitoring fee contracts in connection with public equity offerings of two of our portfolio companies and a net $11.2 million decrease in fees received from certain portfolio companies due primarily to a decline in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and a lower average fee received; and (iii) an increase in credits earned by limited partners under fee sharing arrangements in our private equity funds of $61.2 million due to the increase in transaction and monitoring fees. During the year 95 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2009, excluding one time fees received from the termination of monitoring fee contracts, we had 30 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million, compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average fee of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition there was an $18.8 million increase in management fees which was primarily the result of a full year of fees associated with the European III fund which began earning fees in the second quarter of 2008. Expenses Expenses were $317.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $30.7 million, or 8.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the net impact of the following: (i) a decrease in transaction related expenses of $14.0 million attributable to unconsummated transactions during the period, from $28.2 million to $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively; (ii) decreases in operating expenses of $36.4 million (excluding the non-recurring charge described below) primarily as a result of a reduction in professional and other service provider fees due to our efforts to actively manage our expense base in a deteriorating economic environment; (iii) an increase in occupancy costs of $7.1 million reflecting the opening of new offices subsequent to December 31, 2008 as well as an increase in existing office space; and (iv) an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense of $12.6 million resulting from an increase in salaries reflecting the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the expansion of our business as well as an increase in incentive compensation in connection with higher bonuses in 2009 reflecting improved overall financial performance of our private markets management company when compared to the prior period. Our Private Markets expenses exclude a $34.8 million charge incurred in connection with the Transactions. Management has excluded this charge from our segment financial information as such amount will be not be considered when assessing the performance of or allocating resources to, each of our business segments, and is non-recurring in nature. On a consolidated basis, this charge is included in general, administrative and other expenses. Fee Related Earnings Due primarily to the increase in fees described above, fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $240.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $83.9 million, or 53.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $874.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to investment losses of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, investment income (loss) was comprised of (i) net carried interest of $745.5 million and (ii) other investment income (loss) of $128.5 million, which includes net gains from investment activities of $106.4 million, dividends of $23.7 million and net interest expense of $1.6 million. The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2008 consists primarily of the partial sale of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. and the sale of Demag Holdings S.á r.l. The following table presents net unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest by fund for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 ($ in thousands) Millennium Fund $ 380,054 $ (512,564 ) 2006 Fund 203,762 (305,449 ) European Fund 123,834 (268,885 ) Co-Investment Vehicles 57,183 3,244 1996 Fund(a) 47,773 (145,088 ) Asian Fund 22,422 — European Fund II — (50,616 ) Total(a) $ 835,028 $ (1,279,358 ) (a)The above table excludes any funds for which there were no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest during either of the periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, these excluded funds were the European Fund III and KKR E2 Investors (Annex Fund). In addition, subsequent to the Transactions, the 1996 Fund was no longer included in our results. As such, net unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest attributable to the 1996 Fund are only included through September 30, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 40% of unrealized gains were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO), Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ROC). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the unrealized gains, the most significant of which were HCA Inc. (healthcare sector), KKR Debt Investors S.á r.l (financial services sector), and Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector). In addition, there was a significant unrealized gain due to the reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss in connection with the write-off of our investment in Masonite International Inc. (manufacturing sector) when the loss became realized. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 40% of unrealized losses were attributable to decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ROC) and Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the unrealized losses, the most significant of which were Capmark Financial Group Inc. (financial services sector), PagesJaunes Groupe S.A. (media sector), Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector), and ProSieben SAT.1 Media AG (media sector). The decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to deterioration in market comparables and to a certain extent individual company performance. Dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2009 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. Dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2008 consists primarily of dividends earned from Legrand Holdings S.A. The amount of carried interest earned during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 for those funds and vehicles eligible to receive carried interest amounted to $92.3 million of which the carry pool was allocated 40% 97 Table of Contents and the remaining portion was allocated to KKR Group Holdings and KKR Holdings based on their respective ownership percentages. The increase in other investment income of $358.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains from increases in the market value of capital invested by or on behalf of the general partners of our private equity funds. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to economic net loss of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increased investment income described above was the main contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2008 AUM $ 35,283,700 Exclusion of KPE(a) (3,514,400 ) New Capital Raised 683,300 Distributions (808,600 ) Change in Value 7,198,900 December 31, 2009 AUM $ 38,842,900 (a)The AUM reported prior to the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our funds. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our funds are excluded from our calculation of assets under management, because these assets are now owned by us and no longer managed on behalf of a third party investor. AUM in our Private Markets segment was $38.8 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $3.5 billion, or 9.9%, compared to $35.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to $7.2 billion of net unrealized gains resulting from changes in the market values of our portfolio companies, as well as $0.7 billion in new capital raised in our European III Fund, E2 Investors and separately managed accounts. The net unrealized investment gains were driven by net unrealized gains of $2.7 billion, $1.7 billion, $0.8 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion in our 2006 Fund, Millennium Fund, European Fund II, European Fund and Asian Fund, respectively, with all other funds also recording net realized gains during the period. Over 50% of the change in value for the year ended December 31, 2009 was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, notably Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), which we took public in the fourth quarter of 2009, Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO), which went public in the third quarter of 2009, and Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to HCA Inc. (healthcare sector) and Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by a significant unrealized loss relating to Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance, coupled with an overall improvement in global markets. This increase was partially offset by distributions from our funds totaling $0.8 billion comprised of $0.5 billion of realized gains and $0.3 billion of return of original cost. In addition, the change in AUM included a $3.5 billion reduction representing the exclusion of the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our investment funds. 98 Table of Contents Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets fee paying assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2008 FPAUM $ 39,244,800 Exclusion of KPE(a) (3,175,900 ) New Capital Raised 609,000 European Fund III/E2 Investors (571,600 ) Distributions (325,058 ) Change in Value 703,158 December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 36,484,400 (a)The FPAUM reported prior to the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE is excluded from our calculation of fee paying assets under management, because these assets are now owned by us and are no longer managed on behalf of a third party investor. FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $36.5 billion at December 31, 2009, a $2.7 billion decrease, or 6.9%, compared to $39.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $3.2 billion reduction representing the exclusion of the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our investment funds. In addition, the decrease was attributable to distributions of $0.3 billion primarily representing the reduction of capital associated with realization activity and $0.6 billion related to capital that was transferred from a fee paying private equity fund (European Fund III) to a non-fee paying private equity fund (E2 Investors). These decreases were partially offset by new capital raised of $0.6 billion in our European III Fund and separately managed accounts and $0.7 billion of foreign exchange adjustments on foreign denominated committed and invested capital. For additional discussion of our private equity funds and other Private Markets investment vehicles, please see ""Business."" Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 33.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in both the size and transaction volume of private equity investments closed during 2009 as compared with 2008. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2009, our Private Markets segment had $13.7 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. 99 Table of Contents Public Markets Segment The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Public Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The increase is primarily the result of an increase in incentive fee income from KFN of $34.3 million, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The 100 Table of Contents increase in incentive fee income is a result of KFN's financial performance exceeding the required benchmark. The increase in fees is also attributable to increased fee paying assets under management associated with new capital raised (see ""Fee Paying Assets Under Management"" table below) and $6.8 million of net transaction fees earned during the year ended December 31, 2010. No transaction fees were earned during the year ending December 31, 2009. These increases in fees were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in management fees from structured finance vehicles. In 2009, we elected to temporarily receive management fees from structured finance vehicles in lieu of being reimbursed $13.0 million of expenses by KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds. We ceased electing to receive management fees in lieu of the expense reimbursement in the first quarter of 2010 and, as a result, received only $1.3 million of such fees in 2010. Expenses Expenses in our Public Markets segment were $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.0 million, or 2.3%, from $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense of $5.8 million reflecting the hiring of additional personnel and the continued growth of this segment. Partially offsetting the increase in employee compensation and benefits was a decrease in other operating expenses of $4.6 million which was primarily attributable to an $11.7 million decrease in waived expense reimbursements. We waived $13.0 million of expense reimbursements during 2009 from KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds, versus only $1.3 million in 2010, as noted above. This decrease in other operating expenses was partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses resulting from the expansion of our business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Public Markets segment were $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $46.4 million from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in fee related earnings is primarily due to the increase in fees described above. Investment Income (Loss) Our Public Markets segment had investment income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $9.0 million from investment losses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by net carried interest from certain special situations separately managed accounts earned in the year ended December 31, 2010. Economic Net Income Economic net income in our Public Markets segment was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $54.8 million from economic net income of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in fee related earnings described above was the main contributors to the period over period increase in economic net income. 101 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets AUM from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 AUM $ 13,361,300 New Capital Raised 1,970,100 Distributions (1,281,700 ) Foreign Exchange — Change in Value 723,900 December 31, 2010 AUM $ 14,773,600 AUM in our Public Markets segment totaled $14.8 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 10.6%, from $13.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was driven by $2.0 billion of new capital raised across our various Public Markets strategies, as well as a $0.7 billion increase in the net asset value of KFN and certain other fixed income vehicles. These increases were partially offset by $1.3 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 6,295,400 New Capital Raised 1,893,000 Distributions (1,281,700 ) Foreign Exchange — Change in Value 917,700 December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 7,824,400 FPAUM in our Public Markets segment totaled $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 24.3%, from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was driven by $1.9 billion of new capital raised across our various Public Markets strategies, as well as a $0.9 billion increase in the net asset value of KFN and certain other fixed income vehicles. These increases were partially offset by $1.3 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $0.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. There were no committed dollars invested to any of our public markets investment vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2009. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2010 our Public Markets segment had $1.4 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Fees Our Public Markets segment earned fees of $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 6.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease is primarily the result of a $15.2 million decrease in management fees received from the Strategic Capital Funds. 102 Table of Contents The reduction in management fees from the Strategic Capital Funds was partially due to a lower average net asset value during the year ended December 31, 2009 which resulted in a reduction of fees of $7.5 million. Additionally, effective December 1, 2008, the fees for all investor classes of the Strategic Capital Funds were reduced, which resulted in a further reduction of fees of $7.7 million. Management fees were reduced for all investor classes within the Strategic Capital Funds in conjunction with the mandatory redemption and restructuring of the funds, which was effective December 1, 2008. In addition to the reduced fees from the Strategic Capital Funds, there was a $10.2 million decrease in fees received from KFN due primarily to a lower average equity value during the year ended December 31, 2009, offset by an incentive fee received in 2009. KFN's equity value increased during the year ended December 31, 2009, however, because KFN's equity value had declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008, the average equity value for the year ended December 31, 2009 was lower than the average equity value for the year ended December 31, 2008. Separately, the incentive fee at KFN is calculated on a quarterly basis and is earned solely based on KFN's financial performance in a given quarter. As a result, the incentive fee can be earned in one quarter of a given year even if KFN experiences negative financial performance for other quarters during that same year. For additional discussion of the KFN incentive fee, please see ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."" These decreases were offset by a $7.3 million increase in management fees resulting from an increase in capital managed on behalf of third party investors and an increase in management fees from structured finance vehicles totaling $14.0 million. Beginning in 2009 we elected to temporarily receive management fees from structured finance vehicles in lieu of being reimbursed $13.0 million of expenses by KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds, thereby providing incremental cash flow, which otherwise would have been unavailable, to the investors in these entities. The election to receive management fees in lieu of expense reimbursements had an insignificant cash flow impact on us. Expenses Expenses in our Public Markets segment were $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $17.9 million, or 66.9% from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to our waiving of $13.0 million of expense reimbursements during 2009 from KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds, as noted above. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $3.5 million, which was primarily due to increased headcount. Investment Income (Loss) Our Public Markets segment had an investment loss of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $15.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in non-cash stock based compensation expense associated with equity grants received from KFN. Our stock based commitments to employees are tied to the stock price of KFN, and a rising stock price of KFN increases our liability to employees. The stock price of KFN appreciated in 2009 from a price of $1.58 at December 31, 2008 to a price of $5.80 at December 31, 2009. Fee Related Earnings Due primarily to the increase in expenses described above, fee related earnings in our Public Markets segment were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $22.0 million compared to fee related earnings of $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. 103 Table of Contents Economic Net Income Economic net income in our Public Markets segment was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $31.6 million compared to economic net income of $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in fee related earnings described above was the main contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2008 AUM $ 13,167,000 Exclusion of KPE(a) (62,600 ) New Capital Raised 1,416,300 Distributions (2,000,000 ) Investor Redemptions (634,700 ) Change in Value 1,475,300 December 31, 2009 AUM $ 13,361,300 (a)The AUM reported prior to the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our funds. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE and its commitments to our funds are excluded from our calculation of assets under management, because those items are now owned by us and no longer managed on behalf of a third party investor. AUM in our Public Markets segment was $13.4 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 1.5%, compared to $13.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was driven by $1.5 billion of net unrealized gains resulting from improvement in the overall credit markets. Our portfolios for KFN (including its majority owned subsidiaries), the Strategic Capital Funds, and our separately managed accounts primarily consisted of corporate debt, including leveraged loans and high yield bonds, with both asset classes experiencing material price appreciation in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. In addition to the unrealized appreciation on the portfolios noted above, we raised $1.4 billion in new capital for our separately managed accounts. Offsetting these increases was the restructuring and distribution of one of our structured finance vehicles, which decreased our AUM by $2.0 billion. We restructured and distributed this structured finance vehicle in 2009 as we believed the underlying collateral maintenance requirements and financing terms of this structured finance vehicle were no longer attractive. Further offsetting the increases to our AUM were redemptions of $0.6 billion from our Strategic Capital Funds. 104 Table of Contents Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets fee paying assets under management from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2008 FPAUM $ 4,167,000 Exclusion of KPE(a) (62,600 ) New Capital Raised 1,400,000 Distributions — Investor Redemptions (634,700 ) Change in Value 1,425,700 December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 6,295,400 (a)The FPAUM reported prior to the Transactions reflected the NAV of KPE. Subsequent to the Transactions, the NAV of KPE is excluded from our calculation of fee paying assets under management, because those items are now owned by us and are no longer managed on behalf of a third party investor. FPAUM in our Public Market segment was $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 50.0%, compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008. This increase was driven primarily by $1.4 billion of net unrealized gains resulting from improvements in the overall credit markets. Our portfolios for KFN (including its majority owned subsidiaries), the Strategic Capital Funds, and our separately managed accounts primarily consisted of corporate debt, including leveraged loans and high yield bonds, with both asset classes experiencing material price appreciation in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. In addition to the unrealized appreciation on the portfolios noted above, we raised $1.4 billion in new capital for our separately managed accounts. Offsetting the increases to our FPAUM were redemptions of $0.6 billion from our Strategic Capital Funds. For additional discussion of our investment funds, structured finance vehicles, and separately managed accounts, please see ""Business."" Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2009, our Public Markets segment had $816.3 million of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment The following table sets forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was formed upon completion of the Transactions by combining our capital markets business with the assets and 105 Table of Contents liabilities of KPE. As a result, we have reclassified the results of our capital markets business since inception into this segment.

We completed 45 capital markets transactions in 2010, as compared to 11 transactions in 2009. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting the offerings of equity securities than with respect to the issuance of debt securities, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. 106 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses were $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.7 million, or 69.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense relating primarily to increased headcount in connection with the expansion of our business as well as to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from the improved overall financial performance of our capital markets business. Fee Related Earnings Due primarily to the increase in fees described above, fee related earnings in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $60.4 million, as compared to fee related earnings of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Investment Income (Loss) The following table presents the components of other investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 26,241 $ 24,516 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 966,869 333,578 Dividend Income 226,616 598 Interest Income 25,746 5,104 Interest Expense (26,419 ) (14,117 ) Other Investment Income (Loss) $ 1,219,053 $ 349,679 The first nine months of 2009 did not include the results of the net assets acquired from KPE since the Transactions were completed on October 1, 2009. Accordingly, the 2009 amounts reflect investment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the remainder of 2009 activity primarily relates to interest expense at our capital markets business. In 2010, the net unrealized gains were comprised of $821.8 million of net unrealized gains from private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI), which went public in the third quarter of 2010, as well as $145.1 million of net unrealized gains from non-private equity investments (total net unrealized gains included reversals of previously recorded unrealized losses of $216.7 million related to the sale of investments during the year). Net realized gains were comprised of $150.3 million of realized gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which was the partial sale of Dollar General Corporation, and $124.1 million of realized losses from the sale of non-private equity investments, which related primarily to the write-off of our investment in Aero Technical Support & Services S.a.r.l. (industrial sector). Dividend income of $226.6 million in 2010 primarily consisted of dividends earned from HCA Inc. (healthcare sector). In 2009, net unrealized gains were comprised of $293.8 million of net unrealized gains from private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), which went public in the fourth quarter of 2009, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and HCA Inc., as well as $39.8 million of net unrealized gains from non-private equity investments. 107 Table of Contents Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $927.4 million, as compared to economic net income of $367.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in investment income described above was the main contributor to the growth in economic net income. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Fees Fees in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $15.9 million, or 87.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was due to an increase in the number of capital markets transactions during the period. We completed 11 capital markets transactions in 2009, as compared to 9 transactions in 2008. These transactions generated $34.1 million of underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services fees in 2009, compared to $18.2 million in 2008. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting the offerings of equity securities than with respect to the issuance of debt securities, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Expenses Expenses were $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.6 million, or 19.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2008. Substantially all of the increase was comprised of an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense resulting from an increase in salaries and bonuses in 2009 in connection with increased revenues when compared to the prior period and, to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount. Fee Related Earnings Due primarily to the increases in fees as mentioned above, fee related earnings in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $13.4 million, as compared to fee related earnings of $5.3 during the year ended December 31, 2008. Investment Income (Loss) The following table presents the components of other investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 24,516 $ (21 ) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 333,578 — Dividend Income 598 — Interest Income 5,104 489 Interest Expense (14,117 ) (4,597 ) Other Investment Income (Loss) $ 349,679 $ (4,129 ) The first nine months of 2009 did not include the results of the net assets acquired from KPE since the Transactions were completed on October 1, 2009. Accordingly, the 2009 amounts reflect 108 Table of Contents investment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the remainder of 2009 activity primarily relates to interest expense at our capital markets business. The 2008 amounts primarily reflect interest expense from our capital markets business. In 2009, net unrealized gains were comprised of $293.8 million of net unrealized gains from private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), which went public in the fourth quarter of 2009, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and HCA Inc. (healthcare sector), as well as $39.8 million of net unrealized gains from non-private equity investments. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was $367.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in investment income as described above was the main contributor to the increase in economic net income. Segment Partners' Capital The following table presents our segment statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2010: Private Markets Segment Public Markets Segment Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment Total Reportable Segments Cash and cash equivalents $ 229,729 $ 10,007 $ 516,544 $ 756,280 Investments — — 4,831,798 4,831,798 Unrealized carry 523,002 3,001 — 526,003 Other assets 194,424 53,222 39,730 287,376 Total assets $ 947,155 $ 66,230 $ 5,388,072 $ 6,401,457 Debt obligations $ — $ — $ 500,000 $ 500,000 Other liabilities 104,248 10,193 45,837 160,278 Total liabilities 104,248 10,193 545,837 660,278 Noncontrolling interests (1,750 ) 766 16,537 15,553 Partners' capital $ 844,657 $ 55,271 $ 4,825,698 $ 5,725,626 Total Reportable Segments Partners' Capital $ 5,725,626 Plus: Equity impact of Management Holdings Corp. and other (52,745 ) Less: Noncontrolling Interests held by KKR Holdings L.P. 4,346,388 Total KKR & Co. L.P. Partners' Capital $ 1,326,493 Liquidity We have managed our historical liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and the effect of normal changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds; (iv) funding our growth initiatives; (v) distributing cash flow to our owners; and (vi) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, the Senior Notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had an available cash balance of approximately $0.8 billion. 109 Table of Contents Sources of Cash Our principal sources of cash consist of cash and cash equivalents consists of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, capital markets transactions and other investment products; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) realizations from principal investments; and (iv) borrowings under our credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements described below. In addition, a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents was contributed to the KKR Group Partnerships as part of the Transactions. Carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a vehicle with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception; and (iii) all of the cost has been returned to investors with respect to investments with a fair value below remaining cost. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these facilities and other borrowing arrangements: Revolving Credit Agreements As of December 31, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding on any of the revolving credit agreements described below. We may, however, utilize these facilities prospectively in the normal course of our operations. •On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement""). The Corporate Credit Agreement provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. The facility had a term of five years that expired on February 26, 2013. During 2010, amounts outstanding under the Corporate Credit Agreement ranged from zero to $98.0 million. On March 1, 2011, the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement were amended, which reduced availability for borrowings under the facility from $1.0 billion to $700 million and extended the maturity, so that the facility now expires on March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the Issuer (as defined below) of the Senior Notes became guarantors of the Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of our private equity funds. •On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a revolving credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement""). The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. The KCM Credit Agreement has a maturity date of February 27, 2013. In March 2009, the KCM Credit Agreement was amended to reduce the amounts available on revolving borrowings from $700 million to $500 million. As a result of this amendment, the counterparty returned approximately $1.6 million in financing costs. Borrowings under this facility may only be used for our capital markets business. During 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the KCM Credit Agreement. •In June 2007, the KPE Investment Partnership entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the ""Principal Credit Agreement""). The Principal Credit Agreement provides for up to $925.0 million of senior secured credit subject to availability under a borrowing base determined by the value of certain investments pledged as collateral security for obligations under the agreement. The borrowing base is subject to certain investment concentration limitations and the value of the investments constituting the borrowing base is subject to certain advance rates based on type of investment. In September 2009, a wholly 110 Table of Contents owned subsidiary of KKR assumed $65.0 million of commitments on the Principal Credit Agreement from one of the counterparties to the agreement, which has effectively reduced KKR's availability under the Principal Credit Agreement on a consolidated basis to $860.0 million. During 2010, amounts outstanding under the Principal Credit Agreement ranged from zero to $810.0 million. Senior Notes •On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co. LLC (the ""Issuer""), a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp. and an indirect subsidiary of KKR & Co. L.P., issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes (the ""Senior Notes""), which were issued at a price of 99.584%. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will mature on September 29, 2020, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, accruing from September 29, 2010. From time to time, we may borrow amounts to satisfy general short-term needs of our business by opening short-term lines of credit with established financial institutions. These amounts are generally repaid within 30 days, at which time such short-term lines of credit would close. There were no such borrowings as of December 31, 2010. Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: (i) continue to grow our business, including funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; (ii) service debt obligations, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments; (iii) fund cash operating expenses; (iv) pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings; and (v) make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy. We may also require cash to fund contingent obligations including those under clawback and net-loss sharing arrangements. See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing. In addition, as a result of the Transactions, we are responsible for the uncalled commitments once attributable to KPE's investment partnership as a 111 Table of Contents partner in our private equity funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2010: Uncalled Commitments ($ in thousands) Private Markets 2006 Fund $ 362,684 European Fund III 300,540 Asian Fund 117,396 Infrastructure Fund 50,000 E2 Investors (Annex Fund) 30,833 China Growth Fund 8,506 Natural Resources I 5,413 Other Private Markets Commitments 1,264 Total Private Markets Commitments 876,636 Public Markets Mezzanine Fund 34,100 Capital Solutions Vehicles 13,000 Total Public Markets Commitments 47,100 Total Uncalled Commitments $ 923,736 Historically, we have funded commitments with cash from operations that otherwise would be distributed to our principals. We expect to fund future commitments with available cash, proceeds from realizations of principal assets and other sources of liquidity available to us. We and our intermediate holding company, a taxable corporation for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding company's share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding company's share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding company would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings requiring our intermediate holding company to pay to KKR Holdings or transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding company actually realizes as a result of this increase in tax basis, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding company actually realizes as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. This payment obligation is an obligation of our intermediate holding company and not of either KKR Group Partnership. As such, the cash distributions to common 112 Table of Contents unitholders may vary from holders of KKR Group Partnership Units (held by KKR Holdings and others) to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreements to selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. As the payments reflect actual tax savings received by KKR entities, there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR entities and the cash payments to selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. No cash payments were made in 2010 under the tax receivable agreement. We expect our intermediate holding company to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that it realizes. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. We intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business each year in excess of amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other agreements. KKR does not intend to distribute gains on principal investments, other than certain additional distributions that KKR may determine to make. These additional distributions, if any, are intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by KKR. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships, KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships. For the purposes of KKR's distribution policy, our distributions are expected to consist of an amount consisting of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool, and (iii) certain tax distributions, if any. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes if any, (ii) noncontrolling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above. The declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P. and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that such distributions will be sufficient to pay any particular KKR & Co. L.P. unitholder's actual U.S. or non-U.S. tax liability. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2010 on an unconsolidated basis. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 923.7 $ — $ — $ — $ 923.7 Debt payment obligations(2) — — — 500.0 500.0 Interest obligations on debt(3) 40.3 66.6 66.6 151.4 324.9 Lease obligations 30.9 50.3 45.6 96.2 223.0 Total $ 994.9 $ 116.9 $ 112.2 $ 747.6 $ 1,971.6 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due 113 Table of Contents within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Represents Senior Notes which are presented gross of unamortized discount. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming no prepayments are made and the related debt is held until its final maturity date. Future interest rates have been calculated using rates in effect as of December 31, 2010, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contractual arrangements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that include general indemnification obligations. Our maximum exposure under such arrangements is unknown due to the fact that the exposure would relate to claims that may be made against us in the future. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in our consolidated and combined financial statements as of December 31, 2010 relating to indemnification obligations. The partnership documents governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors at the end of the life of the fund. The terms of the Transactions require that our principals remain responsible for any clawback obligation relating to carry distributions received prior to the Transactions up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the Transactions may give rise to clawback obligations that will be allocated generally to carry pool participants and the KKR Group Partnerships in accordance with the terms of the instruments governing the KKR Group Partnerships. As of December 31, 2010, assuming that all applicable private equity funds were liquidated at no value, the amount of carried interest distributed that would be subject to this clawback provision would be $697.0 million, of which $473.4 million would be borne by KKR and $223.6 million would be borne by our principals. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at their December 31, 2010 fair values, the clawback obligation would have been $61.5 million, of which $55.9 million is recorded in due from affiliates and $5.6 million is due from noncontrolling interest holders. The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments attributed to the limited partners of such fund. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity vehicles allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had been previously distributed. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2010, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $1,094.0 million as of December 31, 2010. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, the KKR Group Partnerships will be responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements and will indemnify our principals for personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2010. This table differs from the table 114 Table of Contents presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 14,074.7 $ — $ — $ — $ 14,074.7 Debt payment obligations(2) 171.4 — 817.6 500.0 1,489.0 Interest obligations on debt(3) 55.1 102.2 192.2 151.4 500.9 Lease obligations 30.9 50.3 45.6 96.2 223.0 Total $ 14,332.1 $ 152.5 $ 1,055.4 $ 747.6 $ 16,287.6 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us and our fund investors to fund the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Certain of our consolidated fund investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements in connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns. Such financing arrangements include $796.4 million of financing provided through total return swaps and $192.6 million of financing provided through a term loan and revolving credit facilities. These financing arrangements have been entered into with the objective of enhancing returns and are not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or our management companies. The amount for Senior Notes offering is presented gross of unamortized discount. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming no prepayments are made and the related debt is held until its final maturity date. Future interest rates have been calculated using rates in effect as of December 31, 2010, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The accompanying consolidated and combined statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated funds despite the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our combined statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve: (i) raising capital from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. 115 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $0.7 billion, $(0.3) billion and $(2.4) billion during the years December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments by our funds of $0.3 billion, $(1.2) billion, and $(1.9) billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 an 2008, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $2.4 billion, $(0.3) billion and $0.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains on investments of $5.3 billion, $7.8 billion and $(13.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts are reflected as operating activities in accordance with investment company accounting. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(1.3) million, $(43.0) million and $(61.7) million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $13.1 million, $21.1 million and $13.1 million, as well as a (decrease) increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents that primarily funds collateral requirements of $(11.8) million, $21.9 million and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(0.5) billion, $0.7 billion and $2.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) contributions net of distributions, made to noncontrolling interests, of $0.1 billion, $0.8 billion and $2.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) repayment of debt obligations net of proceeds received of $0.6 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; and (iii) distributions net of contributions to our equity holders of $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated and combined financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation Our policy is to consolidate (i) those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity including those KKR funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities (""VIEs"") for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. 116 Table of Contents The majority of the entities consolidated by us are comprised of: (i) those entities in which we have majority ownership and have control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions and (ii) the consolidated KKR funds, which are those entities in which we hold substantive, controlling general partner or managing member interests. With respect to the consolidated KKR funds, we generally have operational discretion and control, and limited partners have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund. The consolidated KKR funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, those investments are accounted for as investments and carried at fair value as described below. The KKR funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The consolidated and combined financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third party investors, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements. Substantially all of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, our attributable share of the net income from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. Noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than KKR. Fair Value of Investments Our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies under investment company accounting guidance for the purposes of GAAP and, as a result, reflect their investments on the consolidated and combined statement of financial condition at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of investment income in the consolidated and combined statements of operations. We have retained the specialized accounting of the consolidated funds. We measure and report our investments in accordance with fair value accounting guidance, which establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level I—Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I include publicly listed equities and publicly listed derivatives. In addition, securities sold, but not yet purchased and call options are included in Level I. We do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. We classified 26.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2010. Level II—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing 117 Table of Contents services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Investments which are generally included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, convertible debt indexed to publicly listed securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 8.5% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2010. Level III—Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments that are included in this category generally include private portfolio companies held through our private equity funds. We classified 65.5% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2010. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2010 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. When determining fair values of investments, we use the last reported market price as of the statement of financial condition date for investments that have readily observable market prices. If no sales occurred on such day, we use the ""bid"" price at the close of business on that date and, if sold short, the ""asked"" price at the close of business on that date day. Forward contracts are valued based on market rates or prices obtained from recognized financial data service providers. The majority of our private equity investments are valued utilizing unobservable pricing inputs. Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market multiples approach that considers a specified financial measure (such as EBITDA) and recent public market and private transactions and other available measures for valuing comparable companies. Other factors such as the applicability of a control premium or illiquidity discount, the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities and any favorable or unfavorable tax attributes are also considered in arriving at a market multiples valuation. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow approach. In this approach, we incorporate significant assumptions and judgments in determining the most likely buyer, or market participant for a hypothetical sale, which might include an initial public offering, private equity investor, strategic buyer or a transaction consummated through a combination of any of the above. Estimates of assumed growth rates, terminal values, discount rates, capital structure and other factors are employed in this approach. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within the range suggested by the two methodologies, adjusted for issues related to achieving liquidity including size, registration process, corporate governance structure, timing, an initial public offering discount and other factors, if applicable. As discussed above, we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our private equity investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions. 118 Table of Contents Approximately 26.0%, or $9.5 billion, and 22.6%, or $6.6 billion, of the value of our investments were valued using quoted market prices, which have not been adjusted, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Approximately 74.0%, or $27.0 billion, and 77.4%, or $22.4 billion, of the value of our investments were valued in the absence of readily observable market prices as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The majority of these investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable market parameters and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable market prices had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable market prices exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time. Our calculations of the fair values of private company investments were reviewed by an independent valuation firm, who provided third party valuation assistance to us, which consisted of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested it to perform. Upon completion of such limited procedures, they concluded that the fair value, as determined by us, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures was reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards. The general partners of our funds are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that the general partner of each fund is required to undertake to determine the fair value of the investments. Changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under ""—Key Financial Measures—Investment Income (Loss)—Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities."" Based on the investments of our private equity funds as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a 10% immediate change in net gains (losses) from the funds' investment activities (including carried interest when applicable), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. However, we estimate the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2010, private equity investments which represented greater than 5% of the net assets of consolidated private equity funds included: (i) Dollar General valued at $3.4 billion; (ii) Alliance Boots valued at $2.5 billion; and (iii) HCA Inc. valued at $2.4 billion. The majority of the value of the investments in our consolidated fixed income funds were valued using observable market parameters, which may include quoted market prices, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Quoted market prices, when used, are not adjusted. Revenue Recognition Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring and transaction fees that we receive from our portfolio companies and capital markets activities and (ii) management and incentive fees that we receive directly from our unconsolidated funds. These fees are based upon the contractual terms of the management and other agreements that we enter into with the applicable funds, portfolio companies and third parties. We recognize fees in the period during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned in accordance with the relevant management or other agreements. Incentive fees are accrued either annually or quarterly after all contingencies have been removed. 119 Table of Contents KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the management fees earned. As of December 31, 2010, the amount subject to refund for which no liability has been recorded approximates $58.7 million as a result of certain funds not yet recognizing sufficient carried interests. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the earned management fees, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements. Recognition of Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the unrealized and realized gains (losses) on investments (including the impacts of foreign currency on non-dollar denominated investments), dividend and interest income received from investments and interest expense incurred in connection with investment activities. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in the fair value of our funds' investments during a period as well as the reversal of unrealized gains or losses in connection with realization events. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a corresponding realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. While this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. Due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the share of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated and combined financial statements. Instead, the investment income that KKR retains in its net income, after allocating amounts to noncontrolling interests, represents the portion of its investment income that is allocable to us. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in its consolidated and combined financial statements. We recognize investment income with respect to our carried interests in investments of our private equity funds and co-investment vehicles, the capital invested by or on behalf of the general partners of our private equity funds and the noncontrolling interests that third-party fund investors hold in our consolidated funds. Recognition of Carried Interests in Statement of Operations Carried interests entitle the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduce noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interests in the KKR funds are included as investment income in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reduced and reflected as investment losses. Carried interest is recognized based on the contractual formula set forth in the instruments governing the fund as if the fund was terminated at the reporting date with the then estimated fair values of the investments realized. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, management believes that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. 120 Table of Contents The instruments governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" or, in certain instances, a ""net loss sharing"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to investors at the end of the life of the fund. Clawback Provision Under a ""clawback"" provision, upon the liquidation of a private equity fund, the general partner is required to return, on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled. Prior to the Transactions, certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to the private equity funds had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of the private equity funds to repay amounts to fund limited partners pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the Transactions require that KKR principals remain responsible for clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the Transactions up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the Transactions are allocated generally to carry pool participants and KKR in accordance with the terms of the instruments governing the KKR Group Partnerships. Net Loss Sharing Provision The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity funds allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by our to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, we will be responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements and will indemnify our principals for personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2010, KKR adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") related to VIEs. The amendments significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis, changing the approach taken by companies in identifying which entities are VIEs and in determining which party is the primary beneficiary. The guidance requires continuous assessment of the reporting entity's involvement with such VIEs. The guidance provides a limited scope deferral for a reporting entity's interest in an entity that meets all of the following conditions: (a) the entity has all the attributes of an investment company as defined under AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, or does not have all the attributes of an investment company but is an entity for which it is acceptable based on industry practice to apply measurement principles that are consistent with the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, (b) the reporting entity does not have explicit or implicit obligations to fund any losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity, and (c) the entity is not a securitization entity, asset backed financing entity or an entity that was formerly considered a qualifying special purpose entity. The reporting entity is required to perform a consolidation analysis for entities that qualify for the deferral in accordance with previously issued guidance on VIEs. Prior to the revision of the consolidation rules, KKR consolidated a substantial 121 Table of Contents majority of its investment vehicles except for KKR Strategic Capital Overseas Fund Ltd., KFN, KKR Index Fund Investments L.P., carry co-investment vehicles and 8 North America Investor L.P. With respect to the unconsolidated investment vehicles, these entities have qualified for the deferral of the revised consolidation rules and the consolidation analysis was based on the previous consolidation rules. In addition, in connection with the adoption of the new consolidation rules, KKR considered whether it was appropriate to consolidate five structured finance vehicle subsidiaries of KFN. With respect to these entities, the primary beneficiary was determined to be KFN, because KFN has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these entities' economic performance and KFN has both the obligation to absorb losses of these entities and the right to receive benefits from these entities that could potentially be significant to these entities. See Note 11, ""Related Party Transactions"" for financial information related to KFN. Accordingly, the revised consolidation rules have not resulted in the consolidation or deconsolidation of any entities. As a result, KKR consolidates the same entities both before and after adopting these new rules. The revised guidance also enhances the disclosure requirements for a reporting entity's involvement with VIEs, including presentation on the consolidated statements of financial condition of assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs which meet the separate presentation criteria and disclosure of assets and liabilities recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition and the maximum exposure to loss for those VIEs in which a reporting entity is determined to not be the primary beneficiary but in which it has a variable interest. Disclosures relating to KKR's involvement with VIEs are disclosed within this Note. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosure on transfers in and out of Levels I and II fair value measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for such transfers. In addition, for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level III), the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances shall be presented on a gross basis, with separate disclosure of gross purchases, sales, issuances and settlements and transfers in and transfers out of Level III. The new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures on the fair value hierarchy to disaggregate disclosures by each class of assets and liabilities. In addition, an entity is required to provide further disclosures on valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for fair value measurements that fall in either Level II or Level III. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level III fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. KKR adopted the guidance, excluding the reconciliation of Level III activity. As the guidance is limited to enhanced disclosures, adoption did not have an impact on KKR's financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect that those movements have on the management fees and carried interests that we receive. We have an increased exposure to market risks as a result of the principal assets. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the value of securities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market Risk Our funds hold investments that are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains from investments in our combined statements of operations. Based on the investments of our funds as of December 31, 2010, we estimate that a 10% decrease in the fair value of our funds' investments would result in a corresponding reduction in investment income. However, we estimate the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on 122 Table of Contents our reported income attributable to Group Holdings would be significantly less than the amount presented above, given that a substantial majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our base management fees in our private equity funds are calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Segments—Private Markets."" In the case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund, vehicle, or specialty finance company, for that particular period. To the extent that base management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management and other amounts that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. Currently, a majority of our private equity funds are based on a percentage of committed or invested capital. Securities Market Risk Our investment funds make certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our private equity funds primarily hold investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these investments may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. Exchange Rate Risk Our private equity funds make investments from time to time in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are denominated. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when our funds have invested a meaningful amount of capital in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated. Because most of the capital commitments to our funds are denominated in U.S. dollars, our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros, British pounds, Indian rupees and Australian dollars). We estimate that a simultaneous parallel movement by 10% in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our funds' investments were denominated as of December 31, 2010 would result in net gains or losses from investment activities of our funds of $844.8 million. However, we estimate that the effect on its income before taxes and its net income from such a change would be significantly less than the amount presented above, because a substantial majority of the gain or loss would be attributable to noncontrolling interests in our funds. 123 Table of Contents Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. Interest Rate Risk We have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing arrangements structured through the use of total return swaps which effectively convert third party capital contributions into our borrowings. These debt obligations accrue interest at variable rates, and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that we would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. Based on our debt obligations payable at December 31, 2010 (inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds), we estimate that interest expense relating to variable rates would increase on an annual basis by $9.9 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points. The estimated impact on interest expense is solely on the debt obligations of our consolidated funds. 124 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:23:43.915750

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated and combined financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, we are a leading global investment firm with $59.0 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2011 and a 35-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. When our founders started our firm in 1976, they established the principles that guide our business approach today, including a patient and disciplined investment process; the alignment of our interests with those of our investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders; and a focus on attracting world class talent. Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and our third-party clients. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 200 private equity investments with a total transaction value in excess of $465 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as fixed income, equity strategies, capital markets, infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on servicing our existing investors and have invested meaningfully in developing relationships with new investors. We conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our investors and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. We seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these 82 Table of Contents aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. Business Segments Private Markets Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. KKR also manages and sources investments in infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. These investment funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. Public Markets Through the Public Markets segment, KKR manages KFN, a specialty finance company, as well as a number of investment funds, structured finance vehicles and separately managed accounts that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, (ii) liquid long/short equity strategies and (iii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments and direct senior lending. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by KKR Asset Management LLC, an SEC registered investment adviser. Capital Markets and Principal Activities Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines our principal assets with our global capital markets business. Our capital markets business supports our firm, our portfolio companies and select third-party clients by providing tailored capital markets advice and by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments and companies seeking financing. Our capital markets services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings, structuring new investment products and providing capital markets services. Our principal asset base includes investments in our investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds. Business Environment As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in North America, Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the world. At the moment, the current global economic environment remains somewhat unbalanced. China, for example, currently accounts for a third of global economic growth. All told, Asia is now driving a substantial portion of total global economic growth. At the same time, Europe continues to experience downward growth trends as sovereign debt issues have affected consumer and business behavior. Global equity markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as equity prices, which have been and may continue to be volatile, significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. For our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. For other investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings, or IPOs, as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. Global equity markets were mixed for the full year of 2011 as strong earnings growth was largely offset by trading multiple compressions in many regions. Volatility also remained outsized as the 83 Table of Contents Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, rose from a low of 14.6 in April 2011 to a peak of 48.0 in August 2011. Ongoing developments such as the status of the U.S economic recovery, Europe's sovereign debt crisis and moderating growth expectations in China and Brazil continue to contribute to market uncertainty and volatility. In 2011, on a total-return basis, the S&P 500 Index posted a full-year gain of 2.1%, while the MSCI World Index posted a decline of 5.0%. The below-investment grade credit markets appreciated modestly with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index and the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index increasing 1.5% and 4.4% in 2011, respectively. Conditions in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity transactions. Similarly, our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness. To the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance and valuations of those portfolio companies and, therefore, our investment returns on our funds. In addition, during economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth, the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt (and thereby extend our investment holding period) may hinder our ability to realize investment gains from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve. Credit markets can also impact valuations. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. During 2011, a fall in applicable interest rates had the effect of positively impacting the valuations of portfolio companies using a discounted cash flow analysis to ascertain fair value. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Our Public Markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit and equity strategies, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and mezzanine debt. As a result, conditions in global credit and equity markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on favorable terms in the future. In addition, our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. As a result, the conditions in global equity and credit markets impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment. Finally, conditions in commodity markets may impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways, including through direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. The price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility and certain commodity prices have risen considerably, driven by growing demand from emerging markets and increased central bank liquidity in the system. If certain of our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw materials or other inputs, or if consumers defer purchases of or seek 84 Table of Contents substitutes for the products of such portfolio companies, such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which may in turn reduce the valuation of those portfolio companies. However, the results of operations and valuations of certain of our other portfolio companies, for example those involved in the development of oil and natural gas properties, may benefit from an increase in commodity prices. Basis of Financial Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our management and capital markets companies, certain variable interest entities, the general partners of certain unconsolidated co-investment vehicles and the general partners of our private equity and fixed income funds and their respective consolidated funds, where applicable. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest or non-economic variable interest in those entities. In particular, the majority of our consolidated funds consist of funds in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds. With respect to our consolidated funds, we generally have operational discretion and control over the funds and investors do not hold any substantive rights that would enable them to impact the funds' ongoing governance and operating activities. As of December 31, 2011, our Private Markets segment included ten consolidated investment funds and thirteen unconsolidated co-investment vehicles. Our Public Markets segment included eight consolidated investment vehicles and nine unconsolidated vehicles. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. For example, the majority of the economic interests in a consolidated fund, which are held by third party investors, are reflected as noncontrolling interests. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the statements of operations. For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Consolidation."" Key Financial Measures Fees Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring, consulting and transaction fees from providing advisory and other services, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance vehicles, and separately managed accounts, and (iii) fees from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements. A substantial portion of monitoring and transaction fees earned in connection with managing portfolio companies are shared with fund investors. Fees reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. However, because those management fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds, net income attributable to KKR is increased by 85 Table of Contents the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. For a further discussion of our fee policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fees."" Expenses Compensation and Benefits Compensation and Benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based payments consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. All KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as Compensation and Benefits expense. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are funded by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary Compensation and Benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's most senior employees are funded by KKR Holdings with distributions that it receives on its KKR Group Partnership Units. To the extent that distributions received by these individuals exceed the amounts that they are otherwise entitled to through their vested units in KKR Holdings, this excess is funded by KKR Holdings and reflected in Compensation and Benefits in the consolidated statements of operations. General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. General, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors. Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value of Investments."" 86 Table of Contents Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that private equity funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. Private equity funds recognize dividend income primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances, principal assets and fixed income instruments in which consolidated funds invest. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from credit facilities entered into by KKR, debt issued by KKR, and debt outstanding at our consolidated funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns, which are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or management companies. In addition to these interest costs, we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. See ""—Liquidity"". Income Taxes The KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes. Furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such wholly-owned subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management Holdings Corp., and of the KKR Group Partnerships, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. We expect that interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to KKR Management Holdings Corp. should increase in future periods as a result of a 2011 recapitalization of KKR Management Holdings Corp. We use the liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership 87 Table of Contents interests in our KKR Group Partnerships that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships held by KKR Holdings, we expect this activity to continue. Segment Operating and Performance Measures The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and as such represent the business in total. KKR discloses the following financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to investors in assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. These financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included within ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Segment Reporting."" Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"") Fee related earnings is comprised of segment operating revenues less segment operating expenses and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments before investment income. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. Economic Net Income (Loss) (""ENI"") Economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of KKR's businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations and management fee refunds; less (iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes. 88 Table of Contents Assets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds and vehicles. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's fixed income products; (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles; and (v) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on the definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM (""FPAUM"") represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds and vehicles, for only those funds and vehicles where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by KKR's investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into KKR's investment of committed capital. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which KKR is entitled to a fee or carried interest and (ii) capital invested by KKR's investment funds and vehicles. Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR's investment funds and vehicles to make future investments. Adjusted Units Adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of KKR that is held by KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of KKR as if all outstanding KKR Holdings units had been exchanged for common units of KKR & Co. L.P. 89 Table of Contents Book Value Book value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of our investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as our overall liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of KKR excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders. Book value differs from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests in consolidated investment vehicles and other entities that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. Cash and Short-Term Investments Cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating KKR's liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into KKR's available liquidity. Cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. The impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis is reflected in the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $989.4 million, which, with the addition of $146.1 million of liquid short-term investments, may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of $843.3 million. 90 Table of Contents Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations The following tables set forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues Fees $ 723,620 $ 435,386 $ 331,271 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 868,749 1,344,455 838,072 Occupancy and Related Charges 54,282 39,692 38,013 General, Administrative and Other 290,974 378,516 319,625 Total Expenses 1,214,005 1,762,663 1,195,710 Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) From Investment Activities 981,858 7,755,090 7,505,005 Dividend Income 225,073 1,250,293 186,324 Interest Income 321,943 226,824 142,117 Interest Expense (72,758 ) (53,099 ) (79,638 ) Total Investment Income (Loss) 1,456,116 9,179,108 7,753,808 Income (Loss) Before Taxes 965,731 7,851,831 6,889,369 Income Taxes 89,245 75,360 36,998 Net Income (Loss) 876,486 7,776,471 6,852,371 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 4,318 — — Net income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 870,247 7,443,293 6,002,686 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. $ 1,921 $ 333,178 $ 849,685 Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $723.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $288.2 million, compared to fees of $435.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in gross monitoring fees of $76.8 million, (ii) an increase in gross transaction fees of $65.5 million, (iii) an increase in capital markets fees of $65.2 million and (iv) an increase in consulting fees of $56.1 million earned by an entity that was not consolidated prior to 2011. The increase in gross monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million in fees received during the current year relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA) and The Nielsen Company (NYSE: NLSN), and the sale of Seven Media Group (ASX: SWM). Termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Excluding the impact of termination payments and consulting fees, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in transaction fees was primarily 91 Table of Contents driven by an increase of $70.6 million in gross transaction fees received from transaction fee-generating investments, reflecting an increase in both the number and size of transaction fee-generating investments during the period. During 2011 there were 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion as compared to 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion during 2010. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in capital markets fees is primarily due to an increase in fees relating to underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services driven by an increase in the number of capital markets transactions during 2011. Expenses Expenses were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the net effect of (i) a net decrease in equity-based payments of $690.0 million offset partially by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation and benefits of $84.0 million. The net decrease in equity-based payments is due primarily to fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, as well as a lower carry pool allocation as a result of the recognition of lower carried interest during 2011 as compared to the comparable prior period. The increase in cash-based compensation and benefits reflects the hiring of additional personnel and the inclusion of compensation incurred by an entity that was not consolidated prior to 2011. The remaining increases were due primarily to increases in occupancy and other operating expenses driven by the continued expansion of KKR's businesses during 2011. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.8 billion, compared to a net gain of $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily driven by a lower level of appreciation in our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 1,006,925 $ 7,511,340 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities (25,067 ) 243,750 Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 981,858 $ 7,755,090 The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for Private Equity Investments which illustrates the variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment 92 Table of Contents Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding gains and losses in our private equity portfolio: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Realized Gains $ 3,962,550 $ 2,474,584 Unrealized Losses from Sales of Investments and Realization of Gains(a) (3,844,707 ) (2,484,878 ) Realized Losses (690,107 ) (122,876 ) Unrealized Gains from Sales of Investments and Realization of Losses(b) 681,952 157,874 Unrealized Gains from Changes in Fair Value 6,960,554 10,010,038 Unrealized Losses from Changes in Fair Value (6,063,317 ) (2,523,402 ) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities—Private Equity Investments $ 1,006,925 $ 7,511,340 (a)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with realization events where such gains become realized. (b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. Dividend Income Dividend income was $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $1.1 billion, compared to dividend income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $82.4 million of dividends from Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), $68.3 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $29.4 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), $26.2 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR) and an aggregate of $18.8 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $931.1 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $273.8 million from Visant Inc. (media sector), $34.4 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. and an aggregate of $11.0 million of dividends from other investments. These types of dividends from portfolio companies may occur in the future; however, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income Interest income was $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $95.1 million, compared to $226.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase primarily reflects the increase in the level of fixed income instruments in our public markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense Interest expense was $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $19.7 million, compared to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 driven by the issuance of the Senior Notes, as defined later in this report, in late September 2010. 93 Table of Contents Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, principally decreased gains from investment activities, income before taxes was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.9 billion, compared to income before taxes of $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting the formation of certain investment vehicles that allow for redemptions by limited partners. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.5 billion, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Fees were $435.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $104.1 million, compared to fees of $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees relating to underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services of $71.2 million driven by an increase in the number of capital markets transactions during the period. In addition, there was a $57.4 million increase in gross transaction fees received from transaction fee-generating investments, reflecting an increase in the number of transaction fee-generating investments during the period. During 2010 there were 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion. During 2009 there were eight transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $4.6 billion. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. Incentive fees from KFN increased $34.4 million as a result of KFN's financial performance exceeding certain required benchmarks for each of the four quarters during the year ended December 31, 2010. KFN only earned an incentive fee in one quarter during the year ended December 31, 2009. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in monitoring fees of $55.2 million, primarily due to $72.2 million in fees received during the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, Dollar General Corporation and Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO) and partially offset by a $16.1 million increase in reimbursable expenses. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with initial public offering activity in our private equity portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we had 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million compared with 30 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of termination payments received in 2009. Expenses Expenses were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.6 billion, compared to expenses of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-cash equity based charges of $261.8 million associated with the issuance of 94 Table of Contents interests in KKR Holdings to our principals, other employees and operating consultants as well as increases in the allocations to our carry pool of $278.7 million. The increase in allocations to our carry pool was due to (i) a higher level of gross carried interest recognized in 2010 and (ii) the allocation of a portion of carried interest to our carry pool for the full year in 2010 versus only one quarter in 2009. Allocations to the carry pool were not made prior to the Transactions on October 1, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, these items resulted in charges recorded in employee compensation and benefits relating to principals and other personnel amounting to $1.1 billion, and charges recorded in general, administrative, and other expense relating to operating consultants amounting to $143.7 million. In addition, other employee compensation and benefits expense, comprised primarily of salaries and incentive compensation, increased $29.7 million as a result of the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of our businesses, and transaction related expenses increased $10.1 million as a result of a higher level of unconsummated transactions during the period. Offsetting these increases was a decrease related to non-recurring charges of $34.8 million associated with the closing of the Transactions in the prior period. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $0.3 billion, compared to net gains from investment activities of $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 7,511,340 $ 7,375,947 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 243,750 129,058 Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,755,090 $ 7,505,005 The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for Private Equity Investments which illustrates the significant variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding significant gains and losses in our private equity portfolio.

(b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. 95 Table of Contents Dividend Income Dividend income was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to dividend income of $186.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $1.2 billion of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $42.6 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received $179.2 million of dividends from two portfolio companies and an aggregate of $7.1 million of comparatively smaller dividends from other investments. Interest Income Interest income was $226.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $84.7 million, compared to interest income of $142.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily reflects an increase in the level of fixed income instruments in our fixed income vehicles and our private equity portfolio. Interest Expense Interest expense was $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $26.5 million, compared to interest expense of $79.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings resulting from the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit agreements, partially offset by the issuance of Senior Notes during 2010. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, income before taxes was $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.0 billion, compared to income before taxes of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.4 billion, compared to $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Segment Analysis The following is a discussion of the results of our three reportable business segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Basis of Financial Presentation—Segment Results"" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 96 Table of Contents Private Markets Segment The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Private Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Fees Management and Incentive Fees: Management Fees $ 430,400 $ 396,227 $ 415,207 Incentive Fees — — — Total Management and Incentive Fees 430,400 396,227 415,207 Net Monitoring and Transaction Fees: Monitoring Fees 163,769 86,932 158,243 Transaction Fees 166,654 96,000 57,699 Fee Credits (144,928 ) (52,563 ) (73,900 ) Net Monitoring and Transaction Fees 185,495 130,369 142,042 Total Fees 615,895 526,596 557,249 Expenses Compensation and Benefits(a) 185,709 159,561 147,801 Occupancy and Related Charges 45,694 36,395 34,747 Other Operating Expenses 157,901 148,357 134,610 Total Expenses 389,304 344,313 317,158 Fee Related Earnings 226,591 182,283 240,091 Investment Income (Loss) Gross Carried interest 266,211 1,202,070 826,193 Less: Allocation to KKR Carry Pool (109,361 ) (453,872 ) (57,971 ) Less: Management Fee Refunds (17,587 ) (143,446 ) (22,720 ) Net Carried Interest 139,263 604,752 745,502 Other Investment Income (Loss) (549 ) (1,643 ) 128,528 Total Investment Income (loss) 138,714 603,109 874,030 Income (Loss) Before Noncontrolling Interests in Income of Consolidated Entities 365,305 785,392 1,114,121 Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2,536 839 497 Economic Net Income (Loss) $ 362,769 $ 784,553 $ 1,113,624 Assets Under Management (Period End) $ 43,627,900 $ 46,223,900 $ 38,842,900 Fee Paying Assets Under Management (Period End) $ 37,869,700 $ 38,186,700 $ 36,484,400 Committed Dollars Invested $ 5,033,300 $ 4,555,700 $ 2,107,700 Uncalled Commitments (Period End) $ 10,070,300 $ 12,625,900 $ 13,728,100 (a)Excludes an $8.3 million charge for non-cash equity based compensation during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with equity awards granted under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. 97 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $615.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $89.3 million, compared to fees of $526.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in gross monitoring fees of $76.8 million, an increase in gross transaction fees of $70.7 million and an increase in management fees of $34.2 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $92.4 million. The increase in gross transaction fees was primarily the result in the increase in both the size and number of fee-generating investments completed. During 2011 there were 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion compared to 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion during 2010. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in gross monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs or sales of three portfolio companies, HCA, Inc., The Nielsen Company B.V. and Seven Media Group, which impacted fees by $39.7 million, net of associated fee credits. Termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Excluding the impact of termination payments, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in management fees was primarily due to our China Growth Fund paying a full year of fees during 2011 as compared to only one quarter in 2010 and to a lesser extent an increase in the number of fee paying investment vehicles. Expenses Expenses were $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $45.0 million, compared to expenses of $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of $26.1 million in compensation and benefits expense and an increase in occupancy and related charges of $9.3 million, each of which is a reflection of the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of this business. The remaining increases were due primarily to increases in professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the formation of new investment vehicles. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $226.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $44.3 million, compared to fee related earnings of $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income (loss) was $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $464.4 million, compared to investment income (loss) of $603.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 driven primarily by a lower level of appreciation in our private equity funds. For the year ended December 31, 2011, investment income (loss) was comprised primarily of net carried interest of $139.3 million. 98 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 486,382 $ 420,574 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) (242,104 ) 593,971 Dividends and Interest 21,933 187,525 Gross carried interest 266,211 1,202,070 Less: Allocation to KKR carry pool (109,361 ) (453,872 ) Less: Management fee refunds (17,587 ) (143,446 ) Net carried interest $ 139,263 $ 604,752 Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2011 consist primarily of realized gains from the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Avago Technologies Limited, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC (energy sector). These gains were partially offset by the write-off of our investment in Capmark Financial Group, Inc. (financial services sector). Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2010 consist primarily of the sales of East Resources Inc. (energy sector), and partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Avago Technologies Limited. The following table presents net unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest by fund for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Asian Fund $ 65,763 $ 170,526 Co-Investment Vehicles 35,648 40,926 China Growth 12,388 — E2 Investors 536 968 European Fund III (9,378 ) 21,768 Millennium Fund (37,456 ) 73,098 2006 Fund (120,395 ) 216,594 European Fund (189,210 ) 70,091 Total(a) $ (242,104 ) $ 593,971 (a)The above table excludes any funds for which there were no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest during either of the periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the European II Fund was excluded. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net unrealized losses of $242.1 million included $419.4 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial sales or write-offs which were partially offset by $177.3 million of net unrealized gains reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses resulted primarily from the partial sales of Avago Technologies Limited, Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, which were partially offset by the write-off of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. Of the $177.3 million of net increases in value, 80.3% was attributable to 99 Table of Contents increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE: JAZZ). These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses on HCA, Inc., Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK:1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Oriental Brewery (consumer sector) and Intelligence Ltd. (service sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses on Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector) reflecting decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 33% of net unrealized gains from changes in value were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the net unrealized gains from changes in value, the most significant of which were HCA Inc., Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector) and US Foods, formerly known as US Foodservice (retail sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists primarily of dividends earned from HCA Inc. and Visant Inc. Management fee refunds amounted to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $125.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. The lower management fee refund figure primarily reflects the 2006 Fund becoming carry-earning in 2010, as well as a benefit in the current year due to certain funds declining in value which triggered the reversal of management fee refunds related to management fees earned in the prior year. Economic Net Income Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $362.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $421.8 million, compared to economic net income of $784.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2010 AUM $ 46,223,900 New Capital Raised 2,347,100 Distributions (6,463,100 ) Foreign Exchange (57,100 ) Change in Value 1,577,100 December 31, 2011 AUM $ 43,627,900 AUM for the Private Markets segment was $43.6 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.6 billion, compared to $46.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to 100 Table of Contents distributions from our funds totaling $6.5 billion which was comprised of $4.3 billion of realized gains and $2.2 billion of return of original cost. This decrease was partially offset by $2.3 billion in new capital raised relating primarily to our natural resources strategy and our infrastructure strategy as well as net unrealized gains from changes in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $1.6 billion. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity funds were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion in our 2006 Fund and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 78% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V. and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., partially offset by decreases in Legrand Holdings S.A., Sealy Corporation and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to Oriental Brewery and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Biomet, Inc. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 38,186,700 New Capital Raised 2,197,400 Distributions (2,276,500 ) Foreign Exchange (222,900 ) Change in Value (15,000 ) December 31, 2011 FPAUM $ 37,869,700 FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $37.9 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.3 billion, compared to $38.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to distributions from our funds totaling $2.3 billion and to foreign exchange adjustments on foreign denominated commitments to our funds of $0.2 billion. The decrease was partially offset by $2.2 billion in new capital raised relating primarily to our natural resources strategy and our infrastructure strategy. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to committed dollars invested of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the 2011 as compared with 2010. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2011, our Private Markets Segment had $10.1 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions, including $1.8 billion of uncalled capital commitments from our 2006 Fund. As of February 23, 2012, the 2006 Fund has committed capital to approximately $0.4 billion of pending transactions. There can be no assurance that 101 Table of Contents any of these transactions will close. As of February 7, 2012, we have formally accepted subscriptions for over $5.5 billion in capital commitments on our North America Fund XI. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Fees were $526.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $30.7 million, compared to fees of $557.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a $71.3 million decrease in gross monitoring fees. This decrease was primarily due to the absence in 2010 of $72.2 million in fees received during the year ended December 31, 2009 relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, Dollar General Corporation and Avago Technologies Limited. Excluding the impact of termination payments, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we had 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million compared with 30 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with initial public offering activity in our private equity portfolio. In addition, management fees decreased $19.0 million resulting primarily from the net impact of the following: (i) a $28.2 million decrease in management fees as fees which were previously earned from KPE have been eliminated as a result of the Transactions on October 1, 2009; (ii) a decrease of $10.9 million primarily relating to fee paying capital that was transferred from a fee paying private equity fund (European Fund III) to a non-fee paying private equity fund (E2 Investors) subsequent to September 30, 2009; (iii) a $5.4 million net decrease due primarily to a reduction in fee paying capital at our private equity funds in connection with realization activity offset by new fee paying capital raised; and (iv) an increase of $25.5 million associated with a reduction in waived management fees during 2010. The net decrease in fees was partially offset by (i) an increase in gross transaction fees of $38.3 million primarily reflecting an increase in the number of transaction fee-generating investments during the period and (ii) a $21.3 million decrease in credits earned by limited partners under fee sharing arrangements in our private equity funds due primarily to the decline in gross transaction and monitoring fees. During 2010 there were 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion as compared to eight transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $4.6 billion in 2009. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. Expenses Expenses were $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $27.2 million, compared to expenses of $317.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other operating expenses of $13.7 million primarily reflecting an increase in transaction related expenses of $10.1 million attributable to unconsummated transactions during the period. In addition, employee compensation and benefits expense increased $11.8 million reflecting the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of our business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $57.8 million, compared to fee related earnings of $240.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to the decline in fees and increase in expenses described above. 102 Table of Contents Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $603.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $270.9 million, compared to investment income of $874.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by certain adjustments related to the Combination Transaction that were applicable for the full year of 2010 versus only one quarter in 2009, including (i) the exclusion of carried interest from the 1996 Fund, (ii) the exclusion of carried interest allocated to certain of our former principals, (iii) the allocation of a portion of carried interest to the carry pool, and (iv) the exclusion of investment gains and losses on capital invested by or on behalf of the general partners of our private equity funds. For the year ended December 31, 2010, investment income (loss) included (i) net carried interest of $604.8 million and (ii) other investment income (loss) of $(1.6) million, which was comprised primarily of losses from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

In addition, subsequent to the Transactions, the 1996 Fund was no longer included in our results and therefore no 103 Table of Contents unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest attributable to the 1996 Fund are included for the year ended December 31, 2010 or the three months ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 33% of net unrealized gains from changes in value were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the net unrealized gains from changes in value, the most significant of which were HCA Inc., Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector) and US Foods, formerly known as US Foodservice (retail sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 40% of unrealized gains were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Legrand Holdings S.A., Avago Technologies Limited, Sealy Corporation and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ROC). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the unrealized gains, the most significant of which were HCA Inc., KKR Debt Investors S.a.r.l. (financial services sector), and Alliance Boots GmbH. In addition, there was a significant unrealized gain due to the reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss in connection with the write-off of our investment in Masonite International Inc. (manufacturing sector) when the loss became realized. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists primarily of dividends earned from HCA Inc. and Visant Inc. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. The amount of carried interest earned during the year ended December 31, 2010 for those funds and vehicles eligible to receive carried interest amounted to $1.1 billion, of which the carry pool was allocated approximately 40% and the remaining portion was allocated to KKR and KKR Holdings based on their respective ownership percentages. Management fee refunds amounted to $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily reflecting the 2006 Fund becoming carry-earning in 2010. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $784.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $329.1 million compared to economic net income of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in investment income described above was the main contributor to the period over period decline in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 AUM $ 38,842,900 New Capital Raised 3,025,500 Distributions (4,085,200 ) Foreign Exchange (274,800 ) Change in Value 8,715,500 December 31, 2010 AUM $ 46,223,900 104 Table of Contents AUM in our Private Markets segment was $46.2 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $7.4 billion, compared to $38.8 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to $8.7 billion of net unrealized gains resulting from changes in the market values of our private equity portfolio companies, as well as $3.0 billion of new capital raised. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity funds were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.2 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.8 billion in our 2006 Fund, Millennium Fund, European Fund II, Asian Fund and European Fund, respectively. Approximately 40% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly listed investments, notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI), which was taken public during the third quarter of 2010. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to HCA Inc. (healthcare sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by significant unrealized losses related to Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector) and U.N Ro-Ro Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Partially offsetting these increases were distributions from our funds totaling $4.1 billion, which was comprised of $3.3 billion of realized gains and $0.8 billion of return of original cost. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2009 to December 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 36,484,400 New Capital Raised 2,971,600 Distributions (650,300 ) Foreign Exchange (658,800 ) Change in Value 39,800 December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 38,186,700 FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $38.2 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.7 billion, compared to $36.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to new fee paying capital raised during 2010, including $0.9 billion for our China Growth Fund and $1.1 billion for an infrastructure separately managed account. The increase was partially offset by distributions of $0.7 billion and a $0.7 billion decrease related to foreign exchange adjustments on foreign denominated commitments and invested capital. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $2.5 billion, compared to committed dollars invested of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009.

L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. 106 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $22.6 million, compared to $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily due to an increase in management fees of $27.9 million reflecting an increase in fee-paying assets under management partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees due to a decline in the financial performance of KFN when compared to the prior year. Expenses Expenses were $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $20.0 million, compared to $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense of $16.2 million primarily attributable to an increase in personnel to support growth in our Public Markets segment, including our equity strategies platform. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $2.6 million, compared to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in fee related earnings is primarily due to the increase in fee income, partially offset by the increase in expenses, as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment loss was of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to investment income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized net carried interests. Economic Net Income Economic net income was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.1 million, compared to economic net income of $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in carried interest described above was the main contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets AUM from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2010 AUM $ 14,773,600 New Capital Raised 1,559,100 Distributions (633,900 ) Redemptions (801,100 ) Change in Value 483,000 December 31, 2011 AUM $ 15,380,700 AUM in our Public Markets totaled $15.4 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $0.6 billion, compared to $14.8 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase for the period was due to $1.6 billion of new capital raised and a $0.5 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles, which was largely offset by $0.8 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts and $0.6 billion of distributions from our other funds and vehicles. 107 Table of Contents Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 7,824,400 New Capital Raised 1,346,300 Distributions (269,500 ) Redemptions (801,100 ) Change in Value 427,500 December 31, 2011 FPAUM $ 8,527,600 FPAUM in our Public Markets segment was $8.5 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $0.7 billion, from $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase for the period was due to $1.3 billion of new capital raised, and a $0.4 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles, which were largely offset by $0.8 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts and $0.3 billion of distributions from our other funds and vehicles. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $980.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $283.1 million, compared to committed dollars invested of $697.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflecting more completed transactions during the current period. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2011, our Public Markets segment had $1.3 billion of uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Our Public Markets segment earned fees of $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $47.5 million, compared to fees of $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in incentive fee income from KFN of $34.3 million, from $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in incentive fee income is a result of KFN's financial performance exceeding the required benchmark. The increase in fees is also attributable to increased fee paying assets under management associated with new capital raised (see ""Fee Paying Assets Under Management"" table below) and $6.8 million of net transaction fees earned during the year ended December 31, 2010. No transaction fees were earned during the year ending December 31, 2009. These increases in fees were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in management fees from structured finance vehicles. In 2009, we elected to temporarily receive management fees from structured finance vehicles in lieu of being reimbursed $13.0 million of expenses by KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds. We ceased electing to receive management fees in lieu of the expense reimbursement in the first quarter of 2010 and, as a result, received only $1.3 million of such fees in 2010. Expenses Expenses in our Public Markets segment were $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.0 million, compared to expenses of $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense of $5.8 million reflecting the hiring of additional personnel and the continued growth of this segment. Partially offsetting the increase in employee compensation and benefits was a decrease 108 Table of Contents in other operating expenses of $4.6 million which was primarily attributable to an $11.7 million decrease in waived expense reimbursements. We waived $13.0 million of expense reimbursements during 2009 from KFN and the Strategic Capital Funds, versus only $1.3 million in 2010, as noted above. This decrease in other operating expenses was partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses resulting from the expansion of our business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Public Markets segment were $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $46.4 million, compared to fee related earnings of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in fee related earnings is primarily due to the increase in fees described above. Investment Income (Loss) Our Public Markets segment had investment income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $9.0 million, compared to investment losses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by net carried interest from certain special situations separately managed accounts earned in the year ended December 31, 2010. Economic Net Income Economic net income in our Public Markets segment was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $54.8 million, compared to economic net income of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

These increases were partially offset by $1.2 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts. 109 Table of Contents Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2009 FPAUM $ 6,295,400 New Capital Raised 1,893,000 Distributions (49,200 ) Redemptions (1,232,500 ) Change in Value 917,700 December 31, 2010 FPAUM $ 7,824,400 FPAUM in our Public Markets segment totaled $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.5 billion, compared to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the size and number of various equity and debt transactions during the period. Overall, we completed 72 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 57 represented debt offerings, as compared to 50 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2010 of 111 Table of Contents which 14 represented equity offerings and 36 represented debt offerings. The fees were earned in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $13.3 million, compared to expenses of $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in Compensation and Benefits expense and a $4.1 million increase in occupancy and other operating expenses relating primarily to increased headcount and the overall expansion of the capital markets business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $51.8 million, compared to fee related earnings of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 a decrease of $1.0 billion, compared to investment income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 driven primarily by a lower level of appreciation of our balance sheet investments.

The net unrealized gains were comprised of unrealized gains relating to the reversals of previously recognized unrealized losses related primarily to the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. and net unrealized gains reflecting increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Dollar General Corporation and The Nielsen Company. These net unrealized gains were offset by the reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with partial sales of private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net realized gains were comprised of $150.3 million of gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which was the partial sale of Dollar General Corporation, and $124.1 million of losses from the sale of non-private equity investments, which related primarily to the write-off of our investment in Aero Technical Support & Services S.a.r.L (industrial sector). The net unrealized gains were comprised of $821.8 million of net unrealized appreciation of private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors NV. Dividend income of $226.6 million in 2010 primarily consisted of dividends earned from HCA Inc. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was $330.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $1.0 billion, compared to economic net income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Fees Fees in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $71.2 million, compared to $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Overall, we completed 50 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2010 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 36 represented debt offerings, as compared to 11 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2009 of which 2 represented equity offerings and 9 represented debt offerings. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting the offerings of equity securities than with respect to the issuance of debt securities, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses were $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.7 million, compared to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense relating primarily to increased headcount in connection with the expansion of our business as well as to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from the improved overall financial performance of our capital markets business. 113 Table of Contents Fee Related Earnings Due primarily to the increase in fees described above, fee related earnings in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $60.4 million, as compared to fee related earnings of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Investment Income (Loss) The following table presents the components of other investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 26,241 $ 24,516 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 966,869 333,578 Dividend Income 226,616 598 Interest Income 25,746 5,104 Interest Expense (26,419 ) (14,117 ) Other Investment Income (Loss) $ 1,219,053 $ 349,679 The first nine months of 2009 did not include the results of the net assets acquired from KPE since the Transactions were completed on October 1, 2009. Accordingly, the 2009 amounts reflect investment income for the fourth quarter of 2009 and the remainder of 2009 activity primarily relates to interest expense at our capital markets business. In 2010, the net unrealized gains were comprised of $821.8 million of net unrealized gains from private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors NV, which went public in the third quarter of 2010, as well as $145.1 million of net unrealized gains from non-private equity investments (total net unrealized gains included reversals of previously recorded unrealized losses of $216.7 million related to the sale of investments during the year). Net realized gains were comprised of $150.3 million of realized gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which was the partial sale of Dollar General Corporation, and $124.1 million of realized losses from the sale of non-private equity investments, which related primarily to the write-off of our investment in Aero Technical Support & Services S.a.r.l. (industrial sector). Dividend income of $226.6 million in 2010 primarily consisted of dividends earned from HCA Inc. In 2009, net unrealized gains were comprised of $293.8 million of net unrealized gains from private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation, which went public in the fourth quarter of 2009, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and HCA Inc., as well as $39.8 million of net unrealized gains from non-private equity investments. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $927.4 million, as compared to economic net income of $367.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in investment income described above was the main contributor to the growth in economic net income. 114 Table of Contents Segment Book Value The following table presents our segment statement of financial condition as December 31, 2011: As of December 31, 2011 Private Markets Segment Public Markets Segment Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment Total Reportable Segments Cash and short-term investments $ 296,717 $ 8,087 $ 684,637 $ 989,441 Investments — — 4,743,406 4,743,406 Unrealized carry 419,523 1,447 — 420,970 Other assets 139,432 58,360 63,799 261,591 Total assets $ 855,672 $ 67,894 $ 5,491,842 $ 6,415,408 Debt obligations $ — $ — $ 500,000 $ 500,000 Other liabilities 128,590 8,153 49,329 186,072 Total liabilities $ 128,590 $ 8,153 $ 549,329 $ 686,072 Noncontrolling interests (1,358 ) 729 19,381 18,752 Book value $ 728,440 $ 59,012 $ 4,923,132 $ 5,710,584 Book value per adjusted unit $ 1.06 $ 0.09 $ 7.14 $ 8.29 The following table provides a reconciliation of KKR's GAAP Common Units Outstanding to Adjusted Units.

Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, including the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds; (iv) funding our growth initiatives; (v) underwriting commitments within our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our owners; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, the Senior Notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $989.4 million. Sources of Liquidity Our principal sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, capital markets transactions and other investment products; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) realizations on and sales of principal investments; and (iv) borrowings under our credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements described below. Carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a vehicle with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns on realized investments since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these facilities and other borrowing arrangements. Revolving Credit Agreements For the year ended December 31, 2011, $50 million of borrowings were made during the year and no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2011, under any of the revolving credit agreements described below. We may, however, utilize these facilities prospectively in the normal course of our operations. •On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement""). The Corporate Credit Agreement originally provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. On February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement (the ""Amended and Restated Corporate Credit Agreement"") such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit facility was reduced from $1.0 billion to $700 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the Issuer of the Senior Notes discussed below became guarantors of the Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of our private equity funds. On June 3, 2011, the Amended and Restated Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50 million. This commitment increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750 million. As of December 31, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under the Amended and Restated Corporate Credit Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $50.0 million was drawn and subsequently repaid. 116 Table of Contents •On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a revolving credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement"") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. The KCM Credit Agreement has a maturity date of February 27, 2013. Borrowings under this facility may only be used for our capital markets business. As of December 31, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2011, no amounts were drawn under the KCM Credit Facility. •In June 2007, KKR PEI Investments L.P., (the ""KPE Investment Partnership"") entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement, expiring in June 2012, with a syndicate of lenders (the ""Principal Credit Agreement""). During December 2011, the KPE Investment Partnership elected to terminate the Principal Credit Agreement in advance of its scheduled June 2012 expiration date as the facility was not contemplated to be further utilized in light of anticipated borrowing needs and availability under the Corporate Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2011, no amounts were drawn under the Principal Credit Agreement. Senior Notes •On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co. LLC (the ""Issuer""), a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp., issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes (the ""Senior Notes""), which were issued at a price of 99.584%. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and will mature on September 29, 2020, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, accruing from September 29, 2010. •The indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on the Issuer's and the guarantors' ability to, subject to exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indenture, as supplemented, also provides for events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes may declare the Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes automatically becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the Senior Notes may be redeemed at the Issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the Senior Notes are subject to repurchase by the Issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: (i) continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; (ii) service debt obligations, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments; (iii) fund cash operating expenses; (iv) pay amounts that may become due under our tax 117 Table of Contents receivable agreement with KKR Holdings as described below; (v) make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy; (vi) underwrite commitments within our capital markets business and (vii) acquire additional principal assets. We may also require cash to fund contingent obligations including those under clawback and net-loss sharing arrangements. See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Capital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing. In addition, we are responsible for the uncalled commitments of the KPE Investment Partnership as a partner in our private equity funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2011: Uncalled Commitments ($ in thousands) Private Markets European Fund III $ 266,900 2006 Fund 126,200 Asian Fund 64,300 Infrastructure Fund 36,000 E2 Investors (Annex Fund) 28,100 Natural Resources I 18,800 China Growth Fund 7,200 Other Private Markets Commitments 9,100 Total Private Markets Commitments 556,600 Public Markets Lending Partners 71,000 Mezzanine Fund 32,800 Special Situations Vehicles 4,800 Total Public Markets Commitments 108,600 Total Uncalled Commitments $ 665,200 As of February 7, 2012, we committed $300 million of capital to North America Fund XI. We expect to fund commitments with cash and short-term investments, proceeds from realizations of principal assets and other sources of liquidity available to us. Tax Receivable Agreement We and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding 118 Table of Contents companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings requiring our intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings or transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of this increase in tax basis, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. This payment obligation is an obligation of our intermediate holding companies and not of either KKR Group Partnership. As such, the cash distributions to common unitholders may vary from holders of KKR Group Partnership Units (held by KKR Holdings and our principals) to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreement to selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units to date. As the payments reflect actual tax savings received by KKR entities, there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR entities and the cash payments to selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $0.2 million of cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. Distributions We intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business each year in excess of amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other agreements. KKR does not intend to distribute gains on principal investments, other than certain additional distributions that KKR may determine to make. These additional distributions, if any, are generally intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by KKR. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships, KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships. For purposes of KKR's distribution policy, our distributions are expected to consist of an amount comprised of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool, and (iii) any additional distributions for certain taxes as described above. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) noncontrolling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above. The declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P. and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that such distributions will be sufficient to pay any particular KKR & Co. L.P. unitholder's actual U.S. or non-U.S. tax liability. 119 Table of Contents Other Liquidity Needs We may also be required to fund various underwriting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments. We generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own account. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2011 on an unconsolidated basis. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 665.2 $ — $ — $ — $ 665.2 Debt payment obligations(2) — — — 500.0 500.0 Interest obligations on debt(3) 34.8 64.9 64.4 127.5 291.6 Lending commitments(4) 81.7 — — — 81.7 Lease obligations 40.8 81.3 77.4 150.0 349.5 Total $ 822.5 $ 146.2 $ 141.8 $ 777.5 $ 1,888.0 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Represents Senior Notes which are presented gross of unamortized discount. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2011, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. In the normal course of business, we also enter into contractual arrangements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that include general indemnification obligations. Our maximum exposure under such arrangements is unknown due to the fact that the exposure would relate to claims that may be made against us in the future. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 relating to indemnification obligations. The partnership documents governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors at the end of the life of the fund. Our principals are responsible for any clawback obligation relating to carry distributions received prior to October 1, 2009 up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to October 1, 2009 may give rise to clawback obligations that will be allocated generally to carry pool 120 Table of Contents participants and the KKR Group Partnerships in accordance with the terms of the instruments governing the KKR Group Partnerships. As of December 31, 2011, assuming that all applicable private equity funds were liquidated at no value, the amount of carried interest distributed that would be subject to this clawback provision would be $800.9 million, of which $577.3 million would be borne by KKR and carry pool participants and $223.6 million would be borne by our principals. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at their December 31, 2011 fair values, the clawback obligation would have been $82.7 million, of which $55.9 million is recorded in due from affiliates, $7.7 million is due from noncontrolling interest holders, $7.6 million reduces the amount of carried interest payable to KKR's principals, and $11.5 million is the obligation of KKR. Our other investment vehicles, including mezzanine, infrastructure and special situations generally include clawback provisions, however, no distributions of carried interest have been made with respect to these vehicles as of December 31, 2011. The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments attributed to the limited partners of such fund. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity vehicles allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had been previously distributed. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2011, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $1,006.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, the KKR Group Partnerships will be responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements and will indemnify our principals for personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2011. This table differs from the table presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 9,268.7 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,268.7 Debt payment obligations(2) 212.2 229.3 625.0 500.0 1,566.5 Interest obligations on debt(3) 82.5 94.2 185.1 127.5 489.3 Lending commitments(4) 81.7 — — — 81.7 Lease obligations 40.8 81.3 77.4 150.0 349.5 Total $ 9,685.9 $ 404.8 $ 887.5 $ 777.5 $ 11,755.7 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by our consolidated investment funds, which include amounts committed by KKR and our fund investors, to fund the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, 121 Table of Contents given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Amounts include Senior Notes, gross of unamortized discount as well as financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds. Certain of our consolidated fund investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements in connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns. Such financing arrangements include $796.4 million of financing provided through total return swaps and $270.1 million of financing provided through a term loan and revolving credit facilities. These financing arrangements have been entered into with the objective of enhancing returns and are not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or our management companies. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2011, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular, include our consolidated funds despite the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve: (i) raising capital from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(0.2) billion, $0.7 billion and $(0.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments by our funds of $(0.2) billion, $0.3 billion and $(1.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $3.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $(0.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $(2.3) billion, $5.3 billion and $7.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Certain KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. 122 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(47.6) million, $(1.3) million and $(43.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of $18.2 million, $13.1 million and $21.1 million, as well as a (decrease) increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents that primarily funds collateral requirements of $29.3 million, $(11.8) million and $21.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Our net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $0.4 billion, $(0.5) billion and $0.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling interests, of $0.4 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; (ii) net proceeds received net of repayment of debt obligations of $0.1 billion, $(0.6) billion and $(0.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; and (iii) distributions to, net of contributions by our equity holders, of $(0.2) billion, $(0.1) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation Our policy is to consolidate (i) those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including those private equity, fixed income, and other investment funds and their respective consolidated funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control, or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities (""VIEs"") for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. With respect to the consolidated KKR funds, we generally have operational discretion and control, and limited partners have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund. The consolidated KKR funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, those investments are accounted for as investments and carried at fair value as described below. 123 Table of Contents The KKR funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third party investors, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, our attributable share of the net income from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to us or our partners' capital. Noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than us. Fair Value of Investments Certain KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, KKR reflects their investments in portfolio companies at fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. We categorize and disclose our investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value based on the hierarchical levels as defined within GAAP. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type and the characteristics specific to the asset or liability. Investments and other financial instruments for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level I—Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in Level I include publicly-listed equities, publicly-listed derivatives, and securities sold short. KKR does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where KKR holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. We classified 29.5% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2011. Level II—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is generally determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments and other financial instruments which are included in this category generally include fixed income investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, fixed income securities sold short and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 9.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2011. Level III—Pricing inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments that are included in this category generally include private portfolio companies and fixed income investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. We classified 61.5% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2011. The valuation of our 124 Table of Contents Level III investments at December 31, 2011 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the investment. When determining fair values of investments, we use the last reported market price as of the statement of financial condition date for investments that have readily observable market prices. If no sales occurred on such day, we use the ""bid"" price at the close of business on that date and, if sold short, the ""asked"" price at the close of business on that date. Forward contracts are valued based on market rates or prices obtained from recognized financial data service providers. The majority of our private equity investments are valued utilizing unobservable pricing inputs. Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market multiples approach that considers a specified financial measure (such as EBITDA) and recent public and private transactions and other available measures for valuing comparable companies. Other factors such as the applicability of a control premium or illiquidity discount, the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities and any favorable or unfavorable tax attributes are also considered in arriving at a market multiples valuation. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow approach. In this approach, we incorporate significant assumptions and judgments in determining the most likely buyer, or market participant for a hypothetical sale, which might include an initial public offering, private equity investor, strategic buyer or a transaction consummated through a combination of any of the above. Estimates of assumed growth rates, terminal values, discount rates, capital structure, risk premiums and other factors are employed in this approach, and in certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within the range suggested by the two methodologies, adjusted for issues related to achieving liquidity including size, registration process, corporate governance structure, timing, an initial public offering discount and other factors, if applicable. As discussed above, we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our private equity investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions. Approximately 29.5% or $11.1 billion, and 26.0%, or $9.5 billion, of the value of our investments were valued using quoted market prices, which have not been adjusted, as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Approximately 70.5%, or $26.4 billion, and 74.0%, or $27.0 billion, of the value of our investments were valued in the absence of readily observable market prices as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The majority of these investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable market parameters and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable market prices had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable market prices exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time. 125 Table of Contents Our calculations of the fair values of private company investments were reviewed by an independent valuation firm, who provided third party valuation assistance to us, which consisted of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested it to perform. Upon completion of such limited procedures, they concluded that the fair value, as determined by us, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures was reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards. The general partners of our funds are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that the general partner of each fund is required to undertake to determine the fair value of the investments. Changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under ""—Key Financial Measures—Investment Income (Loss)—Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities."" Based on the investments of our private equity funds as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a 10% immediate change in net gains (losses) from the funds' investment activities (including carried interest when applicable), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. However, we estimate the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2011, private equity investments which represented greater than 5% of the net assets of consolidated private equity investments included: (i) Dollar General Corporation valued at $3.4 billion; (ii) Alliance Boots GmbH valued at $2.5 billion; and (iii) HCA, Inc. valued at $1.9 billion. The majority of the value of the investments in our consolidated fixed income funds were valued using observable market parameters, which may include quoted market prices, as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Quoted market prices, when used, are not adjusted. Revenue Recognition Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring, consulting and transaction fees from providing advisory and other services, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and separately managed accounts, and (iii) fees from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized in the period during which the related services are performed. KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31, 2011, the amount subject to refund for which no liability has been recorded approximates $91.4 million as a result of certain funds not yet recognizing sufficient carried interests. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements. 126 Table of Contents Recognition of Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. Due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. Instead, the investment income that KKR retains in its net income, after allocating amounts to noncontrolling interests, represents the portion of its investment income that is allocable to us. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in its financial statements. Recognition of Carried Interest in Statement of Operations Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduce noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Carried interest is recognized based on the contractual formula set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund was terminated at the reporting date with the then estimated fair values of the investments realized. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. The instruments governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" or, in certain instances, a ""net loss sharing"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to investors at the end of the life of the fund. Clawback Provision Under a ""clawback"" provision, upon the liquidation of a private equity fund, the general partner is required to return, on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled. Certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions prior to October 1, 2009 with respect to the private equity funds had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of the private equity funds to repay amounts to fund limited partners pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. KKR principals are responsible 127 Table of Contents for clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to October 1, 2009 up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to October 1, 2009 are allocated generally to carry pool participants and KKR in accordance with the terms of the instruments governing the KKR Group Partnerships. Our other investment vehicles, including mezzanine, infrastructure and special situations, generally include clawback provisions; however, no distributions of carried interest have been made with respect to these vehicles as of December 31, 2011. Net Loss Sharing Provision The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity funds allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, we will be responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements and will indemnify our principals for personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued amended guidance on fair value measurements to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amended guidance specifies that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and are not relevant when measuring the fair value of financial assets or of liabilities. The amendments include requirements specific to measuring the fair value of those instruments, such as equity interests used as consideration in a business combination. An entity should measure the fair value of its own equity instrument from the perspective of a market participant that holds the instrument as an asset. With respect to financial instruments that are managed as part of a portfolio, an exception to fair value requirements is provided. That exception permits a reporting entity to measure the fair value of such financial assets and financial liabilities at the price that would be received to sell a net asset position for a particular risk or to transfer a net liability position for a particular risk in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The amendments also clarify that premiums and discounts should only be applied if market participants would do so when pricing the asset or liability. Premiums and discounts related to the size of an entity's holding (e.g., a blockage factor) rather than as a characteristic of the asset or liability (e.g., a control premium) is not permitted in a fair value measurement. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements, including, among other things, (a) for fair value measurements categorized within Level III of the fair value hierarchy, (1) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement, (2) the valuation process used by the reporting entity, and (3) a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs, if any, and (b) the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is required to be disclosed (for example, a financial instrument that is measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position but for which fair value is disclosed). The guidance also amends 128 Table of Contents disclosure requirements for significant transfers between Level I and Level II and now requires disclosure of all transfers between Levels I and II in the fair value hierarchy. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As the impact of the guidance is primarily limited to enhanced disclosures, adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the KKR's financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amendments provide an entity with an option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. As the amendments are limited to presentation only, adoption is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect that those movements have on the management fees and carried interests that we receive. We have an increased exposure to market risks as a result of the principal assets. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the value of securities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market Risk Our funds hold investments that are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains from investments in our combined statements of operations. Based on the investments of our funds as of December 31, 2011, we estimate that a 10% decrease in the fair value of our funds' investments would result in a corresponding reduction in investment income. However, we estimate the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on our reported income attributable to Group Holdings would be significantly less than the amount presented above, given that a substantial majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our base management fees in our private equity funds are calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Segments—Private Markets."" In the case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund, vehicle, or specialty finance company, for that particular period. To the extent that base management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management and other amounts that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. Currently, a majority of our private equity funds are based on a percentage of committed or invested capital. Securities Market Risk Our investment funds make certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they 129 Table of Contents operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our private equity funds primarily hold investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these investments may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds make investments from time to time in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are denominated. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when our funds have invested a meaningful amount of capital in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated. Because most of the capital commitments to our funds are denominated in U.S. dollars, our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros, British pounds, Indian rupees and Australian dollars). We estimate that a simultaneous parallel movement by 10% in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our funds' investments were denominated as of December 31, 2011 would result in net gains or losses from investment activities of our funds of $738.7 million. However, we estimate that the effect on its income before taxes and its net income from such a change would be significantly less than the amount presented above, because a substantial majority of the gain or loss would be attributable to noncontrolling interests in our funds. Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. Interest Rate Risk We have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing arrangements structured through the use of total return swaps which effectively convert third party capital contributions into our borrowings. These debt obligations accrue interest at variable rates, and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that we would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. Based on our debt obligations payable at December 31, 2011 (inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds), we estimate that interest expense relating to variable rates would increase on an annual basis by $10.7 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points. The estimated impact on interest expense is solely on the debt obligations of our consolidated funds. 130 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:23:51.638134

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, we are a leading global investment firm with $75.5 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2012 and a 36-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. When our founders started our firm in 1976, they established the principles that guide our business approach today, including a patient and disciplined investment process; the alignment of our interests with those of our fund investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders; and a focus on attracting world class talent. Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and other third parties. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 200 private equity investments with a total transaction value in excess of $470 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as fixed income, equity strategies, hedge fund solutions, capital markets, infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on servicing our existing fund investors and have increased our investment in developing relationships with new investors in our funds. We conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer fund investors, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. We seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. 91 Table of Contents Business Segments Private Markets Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and source investments in infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. Public Markets Through our Public Markets segment, we manage KKR Financials Holdings LLC, or KFN, which is a specialty finance company, as well as a number of investment funds, structured finance vehicles and separately managed accounts that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, (ii) liquid long/short equity strategies, (iii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments and direct senior lending and (iv) hedge fund solutions. Many of these funds, vehicles and accounts, including three management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""1940 Act""), are managed by KKR Asset Management LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. On October 1, 2012 we acquired Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (""Prisma""), an SEC registered investment adviser, which manages our hedge fund solutions strategies. On January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. (""Nephila""), an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk. Capital Markets and Principal Activities Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with our global capital markets business. Our capital markets business, which includes 30 executives supports our firm, our portfolio companies and select third-party clients by providing tailored capital markets advice and by developing and implementing both traditional and nontraditional capital solutions for investments and companies seeking financing. Our capital markets services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings, structuring new investment products and providing capital markets services. In addition, through MerchCap Solutions LLC (formerly known as KKR-SPC Merchant Advisors LLC), we seek to provide certain capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as principal investments to support client needs. KKR's principal assets, which include investments in our investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide us with a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing portfolio of businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. We believe that the market experience and skills of professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of professionals in our Private Markets and Public Markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this asset base over time. Business Environment As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and elsewhere in the world. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments. The current global economic environment remains uncertain. Europe has experienced negative growth trends as sovereign debt concerns have affected consumer and business behavior which has pushed the region into recession. Fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of European countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, 92 Table of Contents stresses in the European banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area. Ongoing austerity and deleveraging in the developed world are likely to persist in the near-term, which may lead to increased volatility in the global capital markets and pose downside risk to the economic outlook. While a number of policy actions have been taken which seek to address the European sovereign debt crisis, if one or more Eurozone members were to leave the Eurozone, the functioning of Europe's single market currency could be undermined which would cause a deeper and more damaging impact on the global economy. Growth in Asian economies is mixed. For example, the rate of real gross domestic product growth in China has increased modestly, but remains lower compared to the pace of growth in prior years. While low inflation has allowed Chinese authorities to ease monetary conditions, rising commodities prices could cause the central bank in China to tighten monetary policy which could further impair growth. The U.S. economy has grown at a moderate rate in 2012, but key indicators of sustainable growth remain under pressure and for the fourth quarter of 2012 the U.S. economy contracted slightly. For example, while unemployment has declined, the unemployment rate remains elevated and consumer and business spending has been cautious. On March 1, 2013, automatic reductions in U.S. federal government spending are scheduled to take effect. In addition, while the federal debt limit has been temporarily suspended, additional efforts to suspend or increase the debt limit may be required as soon as May 2013. A tightening of U.S. fiscal policy and uncertainty about the resolution of such policy issues may further slow U.S. economic growth and adversely impact the global economy. In light of the weakness in the global economy, sluggish domestic growth and fiscal uncertainty, many of our portfolio companies remain cautious with respect to investments and hiring and have lower expectations for near term growth. Moreover, the level of transaction activity in 2012 generally has slowed with both global and North America merger and acquisition volume declining relative to 2011. While the fourth quarter was our most active investing quarter in 2012, we have experienced a decline in our transaction volume in 2012 relative to 2011. Reduced levels of transaction activity tend to result in a reduced amount of transaction fees and potential future investment gains. In addition to economic conditions, global equity markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as equity prices, which have been and may continue to be volatile, significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. For our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. For other investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings, or IPOs, as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. For example in the first quarter of 2013, we were able to complete a secondary sale of common shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI), HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA) and The Nielsen Company B.V. (NYSE: NLSN). Notwithstanding the trends described above, global equity markets rose during the year ended December 31, 2012, with the S&P 500 Index up 16.0% and the MSCI World Index up 16.5%. Volatility decreased during the year as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, beginning the year at 23.0 and ending at 18.0 on December 31, 2012. The below-investment grade credit markets also appreciated, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index and the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index increasing 9.7% and 15.6% during the year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. Conditions in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity transactions. Similarly, our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness. To the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may 93 Table of Contents negatively impact the operating performance and valuations of those portfolio companies and, therefore, our investment returns on our funds. In addition, during economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth, the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt (and thereby extend our investment holding period) may hinder our ability to realize investment gains from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve. Credit markets can also impact valuations. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. Our Public Markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit and equity strategies, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and mezzanine debt. As a result, conditions in global credit and equity markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on favorable terms in the future. In addition, our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. As a result, the conditions in global equity and credit markets, as well as transaction activity in our Private Markets segment and to a significantly lesser extent, Public Markets segment, impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment. Finally, conditions in commodity markets impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways, including through the direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. The price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility, which among other things, could be driven by economic, monetary, political or weather related factors. For example, in 2012, crude oil prices rose approximately 27% to a high of $99 per barrel on September 14, 2012, after falling to a low of $78 per barrel on June 28, 2012. Meanwhile, in 2012 the spot price of the GSCI Agriculture Index rose approximately 40% to a high of 533 on July 20, 2012 after falling to a low of 382 on June 15, 2012. If certain of our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw materials or other inputs, or if consumers defer purchases of or seek substitutes for the products of such portfolio companies, such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which may in turn reduce the valuation of those portfolio companies. However, the results of operations and valuations of certain of our other portfolio companies, for example those involved in the development of oil and natural gas properties, may benefit from an increase or suffer from a decline in commodity prices. In particular, our Private Markets portfolio contains several natural resource-related investments whose values are influenced by natural gas prices. Consequently as natural gas prices have declined, the valuations of these natural resource-related investments in Private Markets have also declined. Furthermore, as we make additional investments in the oil and gas industry, the value of our portfolio may become increasingly sensitive to oil and gas prices. 94 Table of Contents Basis of Accounting The consolidated financial statements (referred to hereafter as the ""financial statements"") include the accounts of KKR's management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest or non-economic variable interest in those entities. In particular, the majority of our consolidated funds consist of funds in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds. With respect to our consolidated funds, we generally have operational discretion and control over the funds and investors in our funds do not hold any substantive rights that would enable them to impact the funds' ongoing governance and operating activities. As of December 31, 2012 our Private Markets segment included eleven consolidated investment funds and fourteen unconsolidated co-investment vehicles. Our Public Markets segment included eleven consolidated investment vehicles and 44 unconsolidated vehicles. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. For example, the majority of the economic interests in a consolidated fund, which are held by third party investors in our funds, are reflected as noncontrolling interests. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Consolidation."" Key Financial Measures Fees Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring and consulting fees from providing advisory and other services, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and separately managed accounts and (iii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. Fees reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. However, because those management fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors in our funds who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds, net income attributable to KKR is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. 95 Table of Contents For a further discussion of our fee policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition."" Expenses Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. All KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as Compensation and Benefits expense. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution. With respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR will allocate to its principals and other professionals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. For the purpose of the discussion under ""—Consolidated Results of Operations,"" these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as Compensation and Benefits expense for KKR employees and General, Administrative and Other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations. However, for the purposes of the discussion under ""—Segment Analysis"" carry pool allocations are recorded as a component of Investment Income (Loss). General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. General, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors. Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. 96 Table of Contents Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements."" Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that private equity funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. Private equity funds recognize dividend income primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancing's undertaken by portfolio companies. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances, principal assets and fixed income instruments in which our consolidated funds invest. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from credit facilities entered into by KKR, debt issued by KKR, and debt outstanding at our consolidated funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow, which are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of our consolidated funds or management companies. In addition to these interest costs, we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. See ""—Liquidity"". Income Taxes The KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes. Furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such wholly-owned subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management Holdings Corp., and of the KKR Group Partnerships, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. We generate interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to KKR Management Holdings Corp. as a result of a 2011 recapitalization of KKR Management Holdings Corp. We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available. 97 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships held by KKR Holdings, we expect this activity to continue. Segment Operating and Performance Measures The segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings L.P. and as such represent the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds that KKR manages. KKR discloses the following financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. These financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included within ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Segment Reporting."" Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"") Fee related earnings is comprised of segment operating revenues less segment operating expenses and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments before investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. Economic Net Income (Loss) (""ENI"") Economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of KKR's businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations and management fee refunds; less (iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: 98 Table of Contents (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes. Assets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds and vehicles. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's fixed income products; (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles; and (v) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds and vehicles, for only those funds and vehicles where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by KKR's investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's investment of committed capital. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and fund co-investors with respect to which KKR is entitled to a fee or carried interest and (ii) capital invested by KKR's investment funds and vehicles. Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital is the aggregate amount of debt or equity capital in transactions originated by KKR investment funds and vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. It does not include capital committed to such transactions by carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in committed dollars invested. Syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment and across its investment platform. Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR's investment funds and vehicles to make future investments. 99 Table of Contents Adjusted Units Adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of KKR that is held by KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of KKR as if all outstanding KKR Holdings units had been exchanged for common units of KKR & Co. L.P. Total Distributable Earnings Total distributable earnings is the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool and (iii) net realized principal investment income; less (i) applicable local income taxes, if any, and (ii) noncontrolling interests. Net realized principal investment income includes, with respect to KKR's principal investments (i) realized investment gains and losses, (ii) dividend income and (iii) interest income, net of interest expense, earned from KKR's principal investments. KKR does not intend to distribute net realized principal investment income other than certain additional distributions that KKR may determine to make, which are intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by KKR. See ""Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Distribution Policy."" We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses), and amounts available for distribution to KKR unitholders, however, total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under KKR's current distribution policy. Book Value Book value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of our investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as our overall liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of KKR excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders. Book value differs from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. Cash and Short-Term Investments Cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating KKR's liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's available liquidity. Cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. The impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $1,534.3 million. Excluding $303.8 million of liquid short-term investments, cash and short-term investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of $1,230.5 million as of December 31, 2012. Consolidated Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of operations of our three business segments in these periods, see ""—Segment Analysis."" 100 Table of Contents The following tables set forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues Fees $ 568,442 $ 723,620 $ 435,386 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 1,280,854 868,749 1,344,455 Occupancy and Related Charges 58,205 54,282 39,692 General, Administrative and Other 259,729 290,974 378,516 Total Expenses 1,598,788 1,214,005 1,762,663 Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 7,871,673 981,858 7,755,090 Dividend Income 940,888 225,073 1,250,293 Interest Income 358,598 321,943 226,824 Interest Expense (69,164 ) (72,758 ) (53,099 ) Total Investment Income (Loss) 9,101,995 1,456,116 9,179,108 Income (Loss) Before Taxes 8,071,649 965,731 7,851,831 Income Taxes 43,405 89,245 75,360 Net Income (Loss) 8,028,244 876,486 7,776,471 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 34,963 4,318 — Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 7,432,445 870,247 7,443,293 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. $ 560,836 $ 1,921 $ 333,178 Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $568.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $155.2 million, compared to fees of $723.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transaction fees of $106.1 million and a decrease in monitoring fees of $73.3 million, which were partially offset by a $17.9 million increase in management fees. The decrease in transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of investments completed in our Private Markets segment and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall capital markets transaction activity. In our Private Markets segment, during 2012 there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion as compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion during 2011. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. In our capital markets business, the transaction fees we receive will depend on the amount of capital our funds and other vehicles deploy, the amount of capital this business syndicates and the number of transactions it completes for third party clients. The decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs of HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V., and the sale of Seven Media Group (media sector), while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other 101 Table of Contents sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Also contributing to the decrease in monitoring fees was a decrease in expense reimbursements in connection with monitoring of portfolio companies of $16.2 million. The decrease in monitoring fees from termination payments and expense reimbursements was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and an increase in the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase relating to the acquisition of Prisma as well as increases relating to new capital raised primarily in our Public Markets segment. As of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $4.0 billion relating to KKR Asian Fund II, $1.1 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.9 billion in connection with other Private Markets and Public Markets funds and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. We will earn management fees on such AUM as this capital is deployed. Expenses Expenses were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in compensation and benefits of $0.4 billion due to (i) higher carried interest being allocated to the carry pool for employees during 2012 as compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of investment income and (ii) higher equity-based compensation relating to equity grants under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by (iii) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $6.9 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by a higher level of net appreciation in our private equity portfolio in the current period when compared to the prior period. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 7,828,926 $ 1,006,925 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 42,747 (25,067 ) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,871,673 $ 981,858 The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for Private Equity Investments which illustrates the variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment 102 Table of Contents Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding gains and losses in our private equity portfolio: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ($ in thousands) Realized Gains $ 5,124,540 $ 3,962,550 Unrealized Losses from Sales of Investments and Realization of Gains(a) (4,845,867 ) (3,844,707 ) Realized Losses (6,463 ) (690,107 ) Unrealized Gains from Sales of Investments and Realization of Losses(b) 6,463 681,952 Unrealized Gains from Changes in Fair Value 11,398,622 6,960,554 Unrealized Losses from Changes in Fair Value (3,848,369 ) (6,063,317 ) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities—Private Equity Investments $ 7,828,926 $ 1,006,925 (a)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with realization events where such gains become realized. (b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd. (AX: SWM), Far Eastern Horizon Ltd. (HK: 3360) and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. (HK: 1252). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector), Oriental Brewery (consumer sector) and KION Group GmbH (manufacturing sector), which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources (energy sector), China International Capital Corporation (financial services sector) and Toys R Us, Inc. (retail sector). The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2011 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion in our 2006 Fund and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 78% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V. and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAZZ), partially offset by decreases in Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK: 1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to Oriental Brewery and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). These unrealized gains 103 Table of Contents were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Dividend Income Dividend income was $940.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $715.8 million, compared to dividend income of $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors (retail sector), $95.0 million from SunGard (technology sector), $78.5 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $82.4 million of dividends from Dollar General Corporation, $68.3 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $29.4 million from TDC A/S, $26.2 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. and an aggregate of $18.8 million of dividends from other investments. These types of dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends and may occur in the future; however, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income Interest income was $358.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $36.7 million, compared to $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase primarily reflects a net increase in the level of fixed income instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense Interest expense was $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $3.6 million, compared to $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in financing arrangements that were entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of enhancing returns. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, principally increased gains from investment activities, income before taxes was $8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $7.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $30.7 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due primarily to increases in the investment values of vehicles that allow for redemptions by limited partners, and to a lesser extent an increase in capital contributions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $6.5 billion, compared to $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. 104 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $723.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $288.2 million, compared to fees of $435.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in gross monitoring fees of $76.8 million, (ii) an increase in gross transaction fees of $65.5 million, (iii) an increase in capital markets fees of $65.2 million and (iv) an increase in consulting fees of $56.1 million earned by an entity that was not consolidated prior to 2011. The increase in gross monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million in fees received during the year ended December 31, 2011 relating to the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the IPOs of two portfolio companies, HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA) and The Nielsen Company (NYSE: NLSN), and the sale of Seven Media Group (ASX: SWM). Termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Excluding the impact of termination payments and consulting fees, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase of $70.6 million in gross transaction fees received from transaction fee-generating investments, reflecting an increase in both the number and size of transaction fee-generating investments during the period. During 2011 there were 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion as compared to 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion during 2010. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in capital markets fees is primarily due to an increase in fees relating to underwriting, syndication, and other capital markets services driven by an increase in the number of capital markets transactions during 2011. Expenses Expenses were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the net effect of (i) a net decrease in equity-based payments of $690.0 million offset partially by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation and benefits of $84.0 million. The net decrease in equity-based payments is due primarily to fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, as well as a lower carry pool allocation as a result of the recognition of lower carried interest during 2011 as compared to the comparable prior period. The increase in cash-based compensation and benefits reflects the hiring of additional personnel and the inclusion of compensation incurred by an entity that was not consolidated prior to 2011. The remaining increases were due primarily to increases in occupancy and other operating expenses driven by the continued expansion of KKR's businesses during 2011. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.8 billion, compared to a net gain of $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, 105 Table of Contents primarily driven by a lower level of appreciation in our private equity portfolio.

The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2010 is related to unrealized gains and losses from 106 Table of Contents changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.2 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion in our 2006 Fund, Millennium Fund, European Fund II, Asian Fund and European Fund, respectively. Approximately 40% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly listed investments, notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI), which was taken public during the third quarter of 2010. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to HCA Inc. (healthcare sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by significant unrealized losses related to Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector) and U.N Ro-Ro Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Dividend Income Dividend income was $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $1.1 billion, compared to dividend income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $82.4 million of dividends from Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG), $68.3 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $29.4 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), $26.2 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR) and an aggregate of $18.8 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received $931.1 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $273.8 million from Visant Inc. (media sector), $34.4 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. and an aggregate of $11.0 million of dividends from other investments. These types of dividends from portfolio companies may occur in the future; however, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income Interest income was $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $95.1 million, compared to $226.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase primarily reflects the increase in the level of fixed income instruments in our public markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense Interest expense was $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $19.7 million, compared to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 driven by the issuance of the 2020 Senior Notes, as defined later in this report, in late September 2010. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, principally decreased gains from investment activities, income before taxes was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.9 billion, compared to income before taxes of $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. 107 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting the formation of certain investment vehicles that allow for redemptions by limited partners. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.5 billion, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. 108 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The following is a discussion of the results of our three reportable business segments for years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Basis of Financial Presentation—Segment Operating and Performance Measures"" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Private Markets Segment The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Private Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Fees Management and Incentive Fees: Management Fees $ 423,921 $ 430,400 $ 396,227 Incentive Fees — — — Total Management and Incentive Fees 423,921 430,400 396,227 Monitoring and Transaction Fees: Monitoring Fees 116,565 163,769 86,932 Transaction Fees 96,454 166,654 96,000 Fee Credits (97,362 ) (144,928 ) (52,563 ) Net Monitoring and Transaction Fees 115,657 185,495 130,369 Total Fees 539,578 615,895 526,596 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 192,765 185,709 159,561 Occupancy and Related Charges 48,562 45,694 36,395 Other Operating Expenses 147,253 157,901 148,357 Total Expenses 388,580 389,304 344,313 Fee Related Earnings 150,998 226,591 182,283 Investment Income (Loss) Gross Carried interest 1,392,755 266,211 1,202,070 Less: Allocation to KKR Carry Pool (565,543 ) (109,361 ) (453,872 ) Less: Management Fee Refunds (143,723 ) (17,587 ) (143,446 ) Net Carried Interest 683,489 139,263 604,752 Other Investment Income (Loss) 599 (549 ) (1,643 ) Total Investment Income (Loss) 684,088 138,714 603,109 Income (Loss) Before Noncontrolling Interests in Income of Consolidated Entities 835,086 365,305 785,392 Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 3,390 2,536 839 Economic Net Income (Loss) $ 831,696 $ 362,769 $ 784,553 Assets Under Management $ 49,127,600 $ 43,627,900 $ 46,223,900 Fee Paying Assets Under Management $ 41,173,000 $ 37,869,700 $ 38,186,700 Committed Dollars Invested $ 3,026,300 $ 5,033,300 $ 4,555,700 Uncalled Commitments $ 14,271,100 $ 10,070,300 $ 12,625,900 109 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $539.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $76.3 million, compared to fees of $615.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross transaction fees of $70.2 million and a decrease in gross monitoring fees of $47.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in fee credits of $47.6 million. The decrease in gross transaction fees was primarily the result of a decrease in the number and size of fee-generating investments completed. In the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a combined transaction value of $24.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs of HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V., and the sale of Seven Media Group, while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. This decrease in monitoring fees from termination payments was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $4.0 billion relating to KKR Asian Fund II, $1.1 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.5 billion in connection with other infrastructure, natural resources and private equity funds and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. We will earn management fees on such AUM as this capital is deployed. Expenses Expenses were $388.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $0.7 million, compared to expenses of $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in other operating expenses related to a lower level of broken deal expenses, reflecting reduced transaction activity, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with increased headcount. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $75.6 million, compared to fee related earnings of $226.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in fees as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $545.4 million, compared to investment income of $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was driven primarily by a higher level of net carried interest in our private equity funds. 110 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 876,790 $ 486,382 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 364,875 (242,104 ) Dividends and Interest 151,090 21,933 Gross carried interest 1,392,755 266,211 Less: Allocation to KKR carry pool (565,543 ) (109,361 ) Less: Management fee refunds (143,723 ) (17,587 ) Net carried interest $ 683,489 $ 139,263 Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2012 consist primarily of realized gains from the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation and Alliance Boots GmbH, and the sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2011 consist primarily of realized gains from the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Avago Technologies Limited (NASDAQ: AVGO), Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC (energy sector). These gains were partially offset by the write-off of our investment in Capmark Financial Group, Inc. (financial services sector).

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gains of $364.9 million included $1,115.7 million attributable to net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, partially offset by $750.8 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales of investments. Of the $1,115.7 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors NV. These increases were partially offset by decreased 111 Table of Contents share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains of $750.8 million resulted primarily from the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation and Alliance Boots GmbH, and the sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net unrealized losses of $242.1 million included $419.4 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial sales or write-offs which were partially offset by $177.3 million of net unrealized gains reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses resulted primarily from the partial sales of Avago Technologies Limited, Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, which were partially offset by the write-off of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. Of the $177.3 million of net increases in value, 80.3% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE: JAZZ). These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses on HCA, Inc., Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK:1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Oriental Brewery (consumer sector) and Intelligence Ltd. (service sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses on Biomet, Inc. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector) reflecting decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in the value of market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012 consists primarily of dividends earned from HCA, Inc. and Academy Sports and Outdoors. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation. Management fee refunds amounted to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $126.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in European Fund III and European Fund II, which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income (loss) in our Private Markets segment was $831.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $468.9 million, compared to an economic net income of $362.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income. 112 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2011 $ 43,627,900 New Capital Raised 7,360,100 Distributions (9,023,900 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (1,327,900 ) Foreign Exchange 16,000 Change in Value 8,475,400 December 31, 2012 $ 49,127,600 AUM for the Private Markets segment was $49.1 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $5.5 billion, compared to $43.6 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $8.5 billion and new capital raised of $7.4 billion related principally to North America Fund XI. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our private equity portfolio of $9.0 billion, comprised of $6.1 billion of realized gains and $2.9 billion of return of original cost, as well as a reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $1.3 billion as a result of the 2006 Fund entering its post-investment period. The change in value in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, and NXP Semiconductors NV, which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd, Far Eastern Horizon Ltd and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH, which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2011 $ 37,869,700 New Capital Raised 7,451,700 Distributions (1,089,400 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (3,205,400 ) Foreign Exchange 99,600 Change in Value 46,800 December 31, 2012 $ 41,173,000 113 Table of Contents FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $41.2 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $3.3 billion, compared to $37.9 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to new capital raised of $7.5 billion relating primarily to North America Fund XI commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees. The increases were partially offset by the reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $3.2 billion as a result of the fund entering its post-investment period during which it earns management fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital at a lower rate as well as distributions of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $4.0 billion relating to KKR Asian Fund II, $1.1 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.5 billion in connection with other infrastructure, natural resources and private equity funds and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. We will earn management fees on such AUM as this capital is deployed. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $2.0 billion, compared to committed dollars invested of $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to a decrease in both the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2012, our Private Markets Segment had $14.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $615.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $89.3 million, compared to fees of $526.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in gross monitoring fees of $76.8 million, an increase in gross transaction fees of $70.7 million and an increase in management fees of $34.2 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $92.4 million. The increase in gross transaction fees was primarily the result in the increase in both the size and number of fee-generating investments completed. During 2011 there were 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion compared to 13 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion during 2010. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in gross monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs or sales of three portfolio companies, HCA, Inc., The Nielsen Company B.V. and Seven Media Group, which impacted fees by $39.7 million, net of associated fee credits. Termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Excluding the impact of termination payments, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million compared with 33 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in management fees was primarily due to our China Growth Fund paying a full year of fees during 2011 as compared to only one quarter in 2010 and to a lesser extent an increase in the number of fee paying investment vehicles. 114 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses were $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $45.0 million, compared to expenses of $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of $26.1 million in compensation and benefits expense and an increase in occupancy and related charges of $9.3 million, each of which is a reflection of the hiring of additional personnel and the continued expansion of this business. The remaining increases were due primarily to increases in professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the formation of new investment vehicles. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $226.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $44.3 million, compared to fee related earnings of $182.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income (loss) was $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $464.4 million, compared to investment income (loss) of $603.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 driven primarily by a lower level of appreciation in our private equity funds. For the year ended December 31, 2011, investment income (loss) was comprised primarily of net carried interest of $139.3 million. The following table presents the components of net carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 486,382 $ 420,574 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) (242,104 ) 593,971 Dividends and Interest 21,933 187,525 Gross carried interest 266,211 1,202,070 Less: Allocation to KKR carry pool (109,361 ) (453,872 ) Less: Management fee refunds (17,587 ) (143,446 ) Net carried interest $ 139,263 $ 604,752 Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2011 consist primarily of realized gains from the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Avago Technologies Limited, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC (energy sector). These gains were partially offset by the write-off of our investment in Capmark Financial Group, Inc. (financial services sector). Net realized gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2010 consist primarily of the sales of East Resources Inc. (energy sector), and partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Avago Technologies Limited. 115 Table of Contents The following table presents net unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest by fund for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Asian Fund 65,763 170,526 Co-Investment Vehicles and Other 35,648 40,926 China Growth Fund 12,388 — E2 Investors 536 968 European Fund III (9,378 ) 21,768 Millennium Fund (37,456 ) 73,098 2006 Fund (120,395 ) 216,594 European Fund (189,210 ) 70,091 Total(a) $ (242,104 ) $ 593,971 (a)The above table excludes any funds for which there were no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest during either of the periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the European II Fund was excluded. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net unrealized losses of $242.1 million included $419.4 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial sales or write-offs which were partially offset by $177.3 million of net unrealized gains reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses resulted primarily from the partial sales of Avago Technologies Limited, Dollar General Corporation, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, which were partially offset by the write-off of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. Of the $177.3 million of net increases in value, 80.3% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE: JAZZ). These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses on HCA, Inc., Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK:1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Oriental Brewery (consumer sector) and Intelligence Ltd. (service sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses on Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector) reflecting decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 33% of net unrealized gains from changes in value were attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and Legrand Holdings S.A. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the net unrealized gains from changes in value, the most significant of which were HCA Inc., Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector) and US Foods, formerly known as US Foodservice (retail sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to both improvements in market comparables and individual company performance. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 consists primarily of dividends earned from Dollar General Corporation. Dividend and interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 consists primarily of dividends earned from HCA Inc. and Visant Inc. Management 116 Table of Contents fee refunds amounted to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $125.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. The lower management fee refund figure primarily reflects the 2006 Fund becoming carry-earning in 2010, as well as a benefit in the current year due to certain funds declining in value which triggered the reversal of management fee refunds related to management fees earned in the prior year. Economic Net Income Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $362.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $421.8 million, compared to economic net income of $784.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income.

The decrease was primarily attributable to distributions from our funds totaling $6.5 billion which was comprised of $4.3 billion of realized gains and $2.2 billion of return of original cost. This decrease was partially offset by $2.3 billion in new capital raised relating primarily to our natural resources strategy and our infrastructure strategy as well as net unrealized gains from changes in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $1.6 billion. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity funds were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion in our 2006 Fund and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 78% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V. and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., partially offset by decreases in Legrand Holdings S.A., Sealy Corporation and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to Oriental Brewery and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Biomet, Inc. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. 117 Table of Contents Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2010 $ 38,186,700 New Capital Raised 2,197,400 Distributions (2,276,500 ) Foreign Exchange (222,900 ) Change in Value (15,000 ) December 31, 2011 $ 37,869,700 FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $37.9 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.3 billion, compared to $38.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to distributions from our funds totaling $2.3 billion and to foreign exchange adjustments on foreign denominated commitments to our funds of $0.2 billion. The decrease was partially offset by $2.2 billion in new capital raised relating primarily to our natural resources strategy and our infrastructure strategy. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to committed dollars invested of $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the 2011 as compared with 2010.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $20.2 million and incentive fees of $9.7 million. The increase in management fees is due primarily to the acquisition of Prisma and to a lesser extent new capital raised. The increase in incentive fees is due to incentive fees earned in our equity strategies business and hedge fund solutions platforms during 2012, neither of which businesses earned incentive fees in 2011, as well as an increase in incentive fees received from KFN resulting from a higher level of income when compared to the prior period. As of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded approximately $0.4 billion relating to certain special situations and direct lending investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. We will earn management fees on such AUM as this capital is deployed. Expenses Expenses were $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $9.0 million, compared to expenses of $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from an increase in the net asset values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income was $102.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $44.9 million, compared to economic net income of $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

These increases were partially offset by $1.5 billion of distributions and redemptions from certain investment vehicles.

Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2012, our Public Markets segment had $1.8 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. 121 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees were $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $22.6 million, compared to $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily due to an increase in management fees of $27.9 million reflecting an increase in fee-paying assets under management partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees due to a decline in the financial performance of KFN when compared to the prior year. Expenses Expenses were $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $20.0 million, compared to $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $2.6 million, compared to $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Investment Income (Loss) Investment loss was of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to investment income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized net carried interests. Economic Net Income Economic net income was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.1 million, compared to economic net income of $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in carried interest described above was the main contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income.

The increase for the period was due to $1.6 billion of new capital raised and a $0.5 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles, 122 Table of Contents which was largely offset by $0.8 billion of redemptions in our liquid credit separately managed accounts and $0.6 billion of distributions from our other funds and vehicles.

Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2011, our Public Markets segment had $1.3 billion of uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. 123 Table of Contents Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment The following table sets forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) Fees Management and Incentive Fees: Management Fees $ — $ — $ — Incentive Fees — — — Management and Incentive Fees — — — Monitoring and Transaction Fees: Monitoring Fees — — — Transaction Fees 129,159 170,480 105,266 Fee Credits — — — Net Monitoring and Transaction Fees 129,159 170,480 105,266 Total Fees 129,159 170,480 105,266 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 29,341 26,109 16,863 Occupancy and Related Charges 900 1,256 945 Other Operating Expenses 10,602 12,171 8,376 Total Expenses 40,843 39,536 26,184 Fee Related Earnings 88,316 130,944 79,082 Investment Income (Loss) Gross Carried Interest — — — Less: Allocation to KKR Carry Pool — — — Less: Management Fee Refunds — — — Net Carried Interest — — — Other Investment Income (Loss) 1,110,503 202,802 1,219,053 Total Investment Income (Loss) 1,110,503 202,802 1,219,053 Income (Loss) Before Noncontrolling Interests in Income of Consolidated Entities 1,198,819 333,746 1,298,135 Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 2,574 3,536 3,033 Economic Net Income (Loss) $ 1,196,245 $ 330,210 $ 1,295,102 Syndicated Capital $ 543,800 $ 2,426,600 $ — Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $41.3 million, compared to fees of $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. While we completed a greater number of capital markets transactions in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year, transaction fees decreased primarily due to a lower level of syndicated capital as equity 124 Table of Contents syndication transaction sizes were significantly higher for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 102 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 88 represented debt offerings, as compared to 72 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 57 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $1.3 million, compared to expenses of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense relating primarily to increased headcount which was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses reflecting a lower level of professional fees. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $42.6 million, compared to fee related earnings of $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily related to the decrease in fees as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $1,110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $907.7 million, compared to investment income of $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The following table reflects the components of investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 715,930 $ 151,666 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 243,727 16,514 Dividend Income 143,297 30,767 Interest Income 45,663 46,556 Interest Expense (38,114 ) (42,701 ) Other Investment Income (Loss) $ 1,110,503 $ 202,802 For the year ended December 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised of $818.6 million of realized gains primarily from the sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were the partial sales of Dollar General, Alliance Boots GmbH and HCA, Inc. These realized gains were partially offset by $102.7 million of realized losses primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH, and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events. 125 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011, net realized gains were comprised of $345.1 million of realized gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation, HCA, Inc., Avago Technologies Limited, and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, partially offset by $193.4 million of realized losses primarily from the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. The net unrealized gains were comprised of unrealized gains relating to the reversals of previously recognized unrealized losses related primarily to the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. and net unrealized gains reflecting increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Dollar General Corporation and The Nielsen Company. These net unrealized gains were offset by the reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with partial sales of private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income was $1,196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $866.0 million, compared to economic net income of $330.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income. Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital was $543.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,882.8 million compared to syndicated capital of $2,426.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarily due to a lower level of private equity syndication transaction sizes when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, as discussed under ""—Fees"" above. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Fees Fees in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $65.2 million, compared to fees of $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the size and number of various equity and debt transactions during the period. Overall, we completed 72 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 57 represented debt offerings, as compared to 50 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2010 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 36 represented debt offerings. The fees were earned in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $13.3 million, compared to expenses of $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in Compensation and Benefits expense and a $4.1 million increase in occupancy and other operating expenses relating primarily to increased headcount and the overall expansion of the capital markets business. 126 Table of Contents Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment were $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $51.8 million, compared to fee related earnings of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 a decrease of $1.0 billion, compared to investment income of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 driven primarily by a lower level of appreciation of our balance sheet investments.

The net unrealized gains were comprised of unrealized gains relating to the reversals of previously recognized unrealized losses related primarily to the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. and net unrealized gains reflecting increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Dollar General Corporation and The Nielsen Company. These net unrealized gains were offset by the reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with partial sales of private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net realized gains were comprised of $150.3 million of gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which was the partial sale of Dollar General Corporation, and $124.1 million of losses from the sale of non-private equity investments, which related primarily to the write-off of our investment in Aero Technical Support & Services S.a.r.L (industrial sector). The net unrealized gains were comprised of $821.8 million of net unrealized appreciation of private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors NV. Dividend income of $226.6 million in 2010 primarily consisted of dividends earned from HCA Inc. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment was $330.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $1.0 billion, compared to economic net income of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. 127 Table of Contents Segment Book Value The following table presents our segment statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2012: As of December 31, 2012 ($ in thousands, except per unit amounts) Private Markets Segment Public Markets Segment Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment Total Reportable Segments Cash and short-term investments $ 358,237 $ 28,690 $ 1,147,360 $ 1,534,287 Investments — — 4,758,157 4,758,157 Unrealized carry 730,292 24,939 — 755,231 Other assets 207,047 280,472 62,119 549,638 Total assets $ 1,295,576 $ 334,101 $ 5,967,636 $ 7,597,313 Debt obligations $ — $ — $ 500,000 $ 500,000 Other liabilities 78,724 16,433 24,275 119,432 Total liabilities 78,724 16,433 524,275 619,432 Noncontrolling interests 1,339 739 18,619 20,697 Book value $ 1,215,513 $ 316,929 $ 5,424,742 $ 6,957,184 Book value per adjusted unit $ 1.72 $ 0.45 $ 7.70 $ 9.87 The following tables provide reconciliations of KKR's GAAP Common Units Outstanding to Adjusted Units and KKR & Co.

Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, including the sale of investments and other principal assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds, (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions; (v) underwriting commitments within our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our fund investors and unitholders; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $1,534.3 million. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, capital markets transactions and other investment products; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) realizations on and sales of investments and other principal assets; and (iv) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our common units described below. With respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2012, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. As of December 31, 2012, netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds, the most significant of which were our domestic 2006 Fund partnership and our European Fund II, which had netting holes of approximately $299 million and $516 million, respectively. These amounts do not reflect realization activity occurring subsequent to December 31, 2012. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, our netting holes may increase or decrease in the future. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these sources of funding. 129 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Agreements For the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings made, and as of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either of the revolving credit agreements described below, except for a letter of credit under the Corporate Credit Agreement described further below. We may, however, utilize these facilities prospectively in the normal course of our operations. •On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement""). The Corporate Credit Agreement originally provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. On February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit facility was reduced from $1.0 billion to $700 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the issuer of the 2020 Senior Notes (discussed below) became guarantors of the Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of our private equity funds. On June 3, 2011, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50 million. This commitment increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750 million. On June 22, 2012, KKR requested the issuance of a letter of credit in the amount of $14.5 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is an unaffiliated third party. The letter of credit was issued on July 2, 2012 and initially set to expire on July 3, 2013. On August 20, 2012, the letter of credit in connection with this fee-generating transaction was increased to $20.0 million and the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2013. A $5.0 million sublimit for letters of credit remains available under the Corporate Credit Agreement. •On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement"") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. On March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition to extending the terms, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a reduction of the cost of funding on amounts drawn and a reduced commitment fee. Borrowings under this facility may only be used for our capital markets business. Senior Notes •On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co.

Common Units •On March 27, 2012, KKR & Co. L.P. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale by us from time to time of up to 1,500,000 common units of KKR & Co. L.P. to generate cash proceeds up to (i) the amount of withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, and (ii) the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan that are settled in cash instead of common units. The administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan is expected to reduce the maximum number of common units eligible to be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan by the number of common 131 Table of Contents units issued and sold pursuant to the registration statement unless such reduction is already provided for with respect to such awards under the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statement effective on April 11, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2012, 468,439 common units were issued and sold under the registration statement and are included in our basic common units outstanding as of December 31, 2012. Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: (i) continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; (ii) service debt obligations that may give rise to future cash payments; (iii) fund cash operating expenses; (iv) pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings as described below; (v) make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy; (vi) underwrite commitments within our capital markets business and (vii) acquire additional principal assets, including the acquisition of other investment advisory and capital markets businesses. We may also require cash to fund contingent obligations including those under clawback, net loss sharing arrangements, contingent purchase price payments in connection with our acquisitions of or investments in equity stakes in other businesses or obligations in connection with the defense, prosecution, or settlement of legal claims. See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Capital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing. In addition, we are responsible for certain limited partner interests in some of our private equity funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2012: Uncalled Commitments ($ in thousands) Private Markets North America Fund XI $ 232,100 European Fund III 174,000 2006 Fund 64,700 Asian Fund 35,400 Infrastructure 34,100 E2 Investors (Annex Fund) 14,000 Natural Resources 13,600 China Growth Fund 6,400 Other 10,800 Total Private Markets Commitments 585,100 Public Markets Direct Lending Vehicles 33,700 Special Situations Vehicles 29,200 Mezzanine Fund 29,900 Total Public Markets Commitments 92,800 Total Uncalled Commitments $ 677,900 132 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $677.9 million to its active private equity and other investment vehicles, (ii) $125.0 million to KKR Asian Fund II L.P. for which the investment period has not yet commenced, subject to adjustment, (iii) $94.2 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business related to revolving credit facilities of Portfolio Companies and other companies and (iv) $150.0 million relating to our joint venture with Stone Point Capital and CPPIB as described below. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding. In addition to the commitments described above, KKR has earmarked approximately $440 million to fund, acquire and develop new strategies, products and initiatives including natural resources, real estate and other strategies. The amounts earmarked to fund and develop new strategies, products and initiatives may be revised or terminated by KKR in its discretion from time to time. Acquisition of Prisma Capital Partners On October 1, 2012, KKR closed its previously announced acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (""Prisma""). Prisma is a provider of customized hedge fund solutions with approximately $8.1 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2012. The initial purchase price was paid by KKR at the closing in cash. KKR may also become obligated to make future purchase price payments in the years 2014 and 2017 based on whether the Prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such years. KKR has the right in its sole discretion to pay a portion of such future purchase price payments, if any, in KKR & Co. L.P. common units rather than in cash. Joint Venture with Stone Point Capital and CPPIB On January 17, 2013, KKR entered into a joint venture partnership with Stone Point Capital (""Stone Point"") and CPPIB Credit Investments, Inc. (""CPPIB""), to establish MerchCap Solutions LLC (""MCS"", formerly known as ""KKR—SPC Merchant Advisors LLC""). MCS will seek to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as make certain principal investments to support client needs. KKR and Stone Point each committed $150 million of equity and CPPIB committed an additional $50 million to MCS to support its business. KKR expects that certain capital markets activities for third parties (other than KKR and its Portfolio Companies) will be principally conducted by MCS. Acquisition of Nephila On January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. (""Nephila""). Nephila is a leading investment manager that offers a broad range of investment products focusing on reinsurance risk, investing in instruments such as insurance-linked securities, catastrophe bonds, and weather derivatives. Nephila has assets under management of approximately $8 billion as of January 1, 2013. Tax Receivable Agreement We and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding 133 Table of Contents companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to executives who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR common units as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. These payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by current and former holders of KKR Group Partnership Units (held by KKR Holdings and our principals) to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $2.9 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31, 2012, $0.5 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized. Distributions KKR intends to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of its investment management business each year in excess of amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business, to make appropriate investments in its business and its investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of its debt instruments or other agreements. KKR does not intend to distribute net realized principal investment income, other than certain additional distributions that KKR may determine to make. These additional distributions, if any, are intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by KKR. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships (the holding companies of the KKR business), KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships. For purposes of KKR's distribution policy, its distributions are expected to consist of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool and (iii) any additional distributions for certain taxes as described above. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) noncontrolling interests and (iii) amounts determined by KKR to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of its business and other matters as discussed above. 134 Table of Contents Total distributable earnings were $1,449.4 million for year ended December 31, 2012, up from $782.6 million and $738.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This increase was primarily related to the increase in net realized principal investment income and realized cash carry from the sale of private equity investments. See ""Segment Analysis"" for further discussion surrounding our private equity and principal realizations. Total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under KKR's current distribution policy. The declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P. and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that such distributions will be sufficient to pay any particular KKR & Co. L.P. unitholder's actual U.S. or non-U.S. tax liability. The following table presents our distribution calculation for years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 as described above: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 FRE(a) $ 319,811 $ 417,153 $ 318,322 Realized cash carry 285,424 202,115 184,153 Net realized principal investment income 866,776 186,288 252,184 Less: local income taxes (15,572 ) (16,291 ) (12,031 ) Less: noncontrolling interests (7,043 ) (6,671 ) (4,409 ) Total Distributable Earnings 1,449,396 782,594 738,219 Less: net realized principal investment income (866,776 ) (186,288 ) (252,184 ) Distributed Earnings 582,620 596,306 486,035 Distributed Earnings to KKR & Co.

L.P. common unit $ 1.22 $ 0.74 $ 0.60 (a)See Note 12 ""Segment Reporting"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of such measure to financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. (b)Represents the amount of distributed earnings allocable to KKR & Co. L.P. based on its ownership in the KKR business as of each respective date. (c)Additional distribution is provided primarily from certain realizations on investments within KKR's capital markets and principal activities segment and was calculated for certain taxes as described in our distribution policy. The amount of any additional distribution in the future should not be expected to be consistent or regularly declared. Other Liquidity Needs We may also be required to fund various underwriting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments. We 135 Table of Contents generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own account. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2012 on an unconsolidated basis. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 677.9 $ — $ — $ — $ 677.9 Debt payment obligations(2) — — — 500.0 500.0 Interest obligations on debt(3) 31.9 63.8 63.8 95.6 255.1 Lending commitments(4) 94.2 — — — 94.2 Other commitments(5) 150.0 — — — 150.0 Lease obligations 44.1 84.1 79.8 125.0 333.0 Total $ 998.1 $ 147.9 $ 143.6 $ 720.6 $ 2,010.2 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Represents 2020 Senior Notes which are presented gross of unamortized discount. The 2043 Senior Notes issued on February 1, 2013 are excluded from the table above. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2012, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. (5)Represents our commitment to our MCS joint venture. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Joint Venture with Stone Point Capital and CPPIB"". The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement, because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2012, a payable of $70.4 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $2.9 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement"". The commitment table above excludes contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with the Prisma acquisition because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was estimated to be $71.3 million. See Note 13 ""Acquisitions"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 136 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we also enter into contractual arrangements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that include general indemnification obligations. Our maximum exposure under such arrangements is unknown due to the fact that the exposure would relate to claims that may be made against us in the future. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012 relating to indemnification obligations. The partnership documents governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors in our funds at the end of the life of the fund. Our principals are responsible for any clawback obligation relating to carry distributions received prior to October 1, 2009 up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to October 1, 2009 may give rise to clawback obligations that will be allocated generally to carry pool participants and KKR. As of December 31, 2012, assuming that all applicable private equity funds were liquidated at no value, the amount of carried interest distributed that would be subject to this clawback provision would be $1,095.4 million, of which $871.8 million would be borne by KKR and carry pool participants and $223.6 million would be borne by our principals. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at their December 31, 2012 fair values, there would have been no clawback obligation. We have other carry-paying vehicles, including our mezzanine, infrastructure and special situations funds, which generally include clawback provisions; however, no distributions of carried interest have been made with respect to these vehicles as of December 31, 2012. The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds that were contributed to us may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments attributed to the limited partners of such fund. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity vehicles allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had been previously distributed. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2012, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $616.7 million as of December 31, 2012. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, the KKR Group Partnerships are responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2012. This table differs from the table 137 Table of Contents presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds. Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 14,471.5 $ — $ — $ — $ 14,471.5 Debt payment obligations(2) 39.6 415.5 170.0 500.0 1,125.1 Interest obligations on debt(3) 51.3 89.6 69.2 95.6 305.7 Lending commitments(4) 94.2 — — — 94.2 Other commitments(5) 150.0 — — — 150.0 Lease obligations 44.1 84.1 79.8 125.0 333.0 Total $ 14,850.7 $ 589.2 $ 319.0 $ 720.6 $ 16,479.5 (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by our consolidated investment funds, which include amounts committed by KKR and our fund investors, to fund the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Amounts include 2020 Senior Notes, gross of unamortized discount as well as financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds. Certain of our consolidated fund investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements in connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the fund. Such financing arrangements include $625.0 million of financing provided through a term loan and revolving credit facilities. These financing arrangements have been entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the fund and are not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or our management companies. The 2043 Senior Notes issued on February 1, 2013 are excluded from the table above. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2012, including both variable and fixed rates provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. (5)Represents our commitment to our MCS joint venture. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Joint Venture with Stone Point Capital and CPPIB"". The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2012, a payable of $70.4 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $2.9 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement"". 138 Table of Contents The commitment table above excludes contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with the Prisma acquisition because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was estimated to be $71.3 million. See Note 13 ""Acquisitions"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular, include our consolidated funds notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of our consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $6.2 billion, $(0.2) billion and $0.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments by our funds of $5.1 billion, $(0.2) billion and $0.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $5.2 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $2.7 billion, $(2.3) billion and $5.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Certain KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(220.9) million, $(47.6) million and $(1.3) million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, computer hardware and leasehold improvements of $37.0 million, $18.2 million and $13.1 million, a (decrease) increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents that primarily funds collateral requirements of $(2.9) million, $29.3 million and $(11.8) million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively as well as cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $(186.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(5.6) billion, $0.4 billion and $(0.5) billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests, of $(4.9) billion, $0.4 billion and $0.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; (ii) net proceeds received net of repayment of debt 139 Table of Contents obligations of $(0.4) billion, $0.1 billion and $(0.6) billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively; and (iii) distributions to our partners of $(0.2) billion, $(0.2) billion and $(0.1) billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation Our policy is to consolidate (i) those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including those private equity, fixed income, and other investment funds and their respective consolidated funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities (""VIEs"") for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. With respect to the consolidated KKR funds, we generally have operational discretion and control, and limited partners have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund. The consolidated KKR funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, those investments are accounted for as investments and carried at fair value as described below. The KKR funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third party investors in our funds, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, our attributable share of the net income from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to us or our partners' capital. Noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than us. 140 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements For the purposes of the discussion under this subsection ""Fair Value Measurements"": Private Equity—Consists primarily of investments in portfolio companies of KKR funds and investments in infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. Fixed Income—Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans), distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in collateralized loan obligations. Other—Consists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity or fixed income investments. Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated KKR funds. The KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. KKR has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated KKR funds in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by the KKR funds are reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. For investments and certain other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated KKR fund, KKR has elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated KKR funds. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodology applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated KKR funds. Investments in unconsolidated investment vehicles are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, KKR's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment vehicles are reported at fair value, the carrying value of KKR's equity method investments approximates fair value. The carrying amounts of other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition (excluding goodwill, intangible assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. See Note 14 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets. See Note 13 ""Acquisitions"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information on contingent consideration. KKR's debt obligations, except for KKR's 2020 Senior Notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value. The fair value for KKR's 2020 Senior Notes was derived using Level II inputs similar to those utilized in valuing fixed income investments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated 141 Table of Contents statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows from highest to lowest: Level I Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt, and securities sold short. We classified 21.4% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2012. Level II Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are fixed income investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 6.2% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2012. Level III Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies and fixed income investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. We classified 72.4% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2012. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2012 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. KKR's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset. A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by KKR in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels I, II, and III, which KKR recognizes at the beginning of the reporting period. 142 Table of Contents Investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. KKR does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where KKR holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. Level II Valuation Methodologies Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities and fixed income and other investments. Fixed income investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. KKR's policy is to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets KKR's best estimate of fair value. For debt securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security. Level III Valuation Methodologies The majority of our Level III investments are private equity investments that are valued utilizing unobservable pricing inputs. Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures including EBITDA multiples and control premiums. Other measures are also used in arriving at a market comparables valuation including illiquidity discounts, the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities and any favorable or unfavorable tax attributes. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used in the discounted cash flow methodology and include assumed growth rates, capital structure, risk premiums and other factors, including, if applicable, factors relating to our estimation of the most likely buyer or market participant for a hypothetical monetization event, which might include public equity offerings or a sale to a private equity investor or a strategic buyer. Also, as discussed in greater detail under ""—Business Environment,"" a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. In certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. Upon completion of the valuations conducted using the market comparables methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology, a weighting is ascribed to each method. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within the range suggested by the two 143 Table of Contents methodologies. When determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, KKR considers, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in our portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. Across our Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 77% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of our private markets investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2012, the weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology for our Level III private equity investments were 47% and 53%, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, we believe that the approach of using both the market multiples methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology resulted in valuations of our aggregate Level III private equity portfolio that were generally lower than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and that were generally higher than if only the market comparables methodology had been used. In addition, an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. When determining the illiquidity discount applied, KKR evaluates each private equity investment to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment in the near-term and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. These factors include whether KKR lacks the unilateral ability to sell the portfolio company or take the portfolio company public, whether the portfolio company is currently engaged in significant restructuring activities, the size of the portfolio company, and whether the company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. Depending on the applicability of the criteria, KKR determines the amount of the illiquidity discount to be applied. Our Level III fixed income investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, fixed income investments are valued by KKR using internally developed valuation models. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers. As discussed above and in the notes to our financial statements, we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies. Level III Valuation Process The valuation process involved for Level III measurements for private equity, fixed income, and other investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. For purposes of this discussion, private equity investments include infrastructure, real estate and natural resources investments. KKR has a valuation committee for private equity investments and a valuation committee for fixed income and other investments. The private equity valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of natural resources and real estate investments. Each of the private equity valuation committee and the fixed income valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued. The valuation teams for natural resources and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently 144 Table of Contents implementing KKR's quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations for all Level III investments, except for certain investments other than KKR private equity investments. All preliminary valuations are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input from their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to a single committee consisting of Senior Principals involved in various aspects of the KKR business. When these valuations are approved by this single committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of KKR's board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors. As of December 31, 2012, upon completion by the independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR, of the investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on certain Level III fixed income investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. As described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time. Changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under ""—Key Financial Measures—Investment Income (Loss)—Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities."" Based on the investments of our private equity funds as of December 31, 2012, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments. As of December 31, 2012, private equity investments which represented greater than 5% of the net assets of consolidated private equity investments included: (i) Alliance Boots GmbH valued at $3.5 billion and (ii) HCA, Inc. valued at $2.1 billion. Revenue Recognition Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring and consulting fees from providing advisory and other services, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and 145 Table of Contents separately managed accounts, and (iii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. Certain of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31, 2012, there is no carried interest subject to management fee refunds, which may reduce carried interest in future periods. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements. Recognition of Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. Due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements. Recognition of Carried Interest in Statement of Operations Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment activities. 146 Table of Contents Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. Clawback Provision The instruments governing our private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision. Under a ""clawback"" provision, upon the liquidation of a private equity fund, the general partner is required to return, on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled. Certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions prior to October 1, 2009 with respect to the private equity funds had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of the private equity funds to repay amounts to fund limited partners pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. KKR principals are responsible for clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to October 1, 2009 up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Carry distributions arising subsequent to October 1, 2009 are allocated generally to carry pool participants and the KKR Group Partnerships. Our other investment vehicles, including mezzanine, infrastructure and special situations, generally include clawback provisions; however, no distributions of carried interest have been made with respect to these vehicles as of December 31, 2012. Net Loss Sharing Provision The instruments governing certain of our private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of our private equity funds allocate a greater share of their investment losses to us relative to the amounts contributed by us to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed. Unlike the ""clawback"" provisions, we will be responsible for amounts due under net loss sharing arrangements and will indemnify our principals for personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. 147 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Measurements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, ""Fair Value Measurement"" (""ASU 2011-04""), which amended Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 to clarify existing guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2011-04 requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level III fair value measurements and provide additional disclosures for classes of assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value. As a result of adopting ASU 2011-04, KKR has expanded its fair value disclosures. See section ""Fair Value Measurements"" above and Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements"". Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, ""Statement of Comprehensive Income"" (""ASU 2011-05""), which requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. The standard did not impact our reported results of operations but did impact our financial statement presentation. KKR has adopted the presentation of total comprehensive income in two consecutive statements. See the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, ""Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities"" (""ASU 2011-11""), which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. Disclosures About Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, ""Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""),"" which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including (i) changes in AOCI balances by component and (ii) significant items reclassified out of AOCI. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, ""Intangibles—Goodwill and Other,"" which provides the option to perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, an entity is required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is intended to simplify the impairment testing, is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. 148 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect that those movements have on the management fees and carried interests that we receive. We have an increased exposure to market risks as a result of our principal assets. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of securities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage and monitor risks through several committees. With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, we manage risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee, and then a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data and other information. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis. Market Risk Our funds hold investments that are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on the investments of our funds as of December 31, 2012, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments. Our base management fees in our Private Markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Segments—Private Markets."" In the case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund, vehicle, or specialty finance company, for that particular period, although certain funds in our Public Markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested. To the extent that base management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management and other amounts that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. Currently, a majority of our private equity funds are based on a percentage of committed or invested capital. Securities Market Risk Our investment funds make certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general 149 Table of Contents economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our Private Markets investment funds primarily hold investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these investments may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds make investments from time to time in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are denominated. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when our funds have invested a meaningful amount of capital in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated. Because most of the capital commitments to our funds are denominated in U.S. dollars, our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros, British pounds and Korean won). We estimate that a simultaneous parallel movement by 10% in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our funds' investments were denominated as of December 31, 2012 would result in net gains or losses from investment activities of our funds of $846.7 million. However, we estimate that the effect on net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. from such a change would be significantly less than the amount presented above, because a substantial majority of the gain or loss would be attributable to noncontrolling interests in our funds. Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. Interest Rate Risk We and our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing arrangements structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates, and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that we would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. Based on our debt obligations payable at December 31, 2012 (inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds), we estimate that interest expense relating to instruments bearing variable rates would increase on an annual basis by $6.3 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points. The estimated impact on interest expense is solely on the debt obligations of our consolidated funds. 150 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 152 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 154 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 155 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 156 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 157 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 159 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 161 151 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Unitholders of KKR & Co. L.P.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of KKR & Co. L.P. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Prisma Capital Partners LP. and its affiliates (collectively, ""Prisma""), acquired on October 1, 2012, as the Company is in the process of evaluating the internal controls of the acquired business. Prisma represents approximately 0.6% of the total consolidated assets and approximately 3.0% of the total consolidated fees of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Prisma. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherit limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation 152 Table of Contents of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KKR & Co. L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP New York, New York February 22, 2013 153 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

(NYSE:KKR), together with its consolidated subsidiaries (""KKR""), is a leading global investment firm that offers a broad range of investment management services to fund investors and provides capital markets services for the firm, its portfolio companies and third parties. Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, KKR conducts business with offices around the world, which provides a global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. KKR operates as a single professional services firm and carries out its investment activities under the KKR brand name. KKR & Co. L.P. was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on June 25, 2007 and its general partner is KKR Management LLC (the ""Managing Partner""). KKR & Co. L.P. is the parent company of KKR Group Limited, which is the non-economic general partner of KKR Group Holdings L.P. (""Group Holdings""), and KKR & Co. L.P. is the sole limited partner of Group Holdings. Group Holdings holds a controlling economic interest in each of (i) KKR Management Holdings L.P. (""Management Holdings"") through KKR Management Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation which is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) KKR Fund Holdings L.P. (""Fund Holdings"" and together with Management Holdings, the ""KKR Group Partnerships"") directly and through KKR Fund Holdings GP Limited, a Cayman Island limited company which is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Group Holdings also owns certain economic interests in Management Holdings through a wholly owned Delaware corporate subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp. and certain economic interests in Fund Holdings through a Delaware partnership of which Group Holdings is the general partner with a 99% economic interest and KKR Management Holdings Corp. is a limited partner with a 1% economic interest. KKR & Co. L.P., through its indirect controlling economic interests in the KKR Group Partnerships, is the holding partnership for the KKR business. KKR & Co. L.P. both indirectly controls the KKR Group Partnerships and indirectly holds equity units in each KKR Group Partnership (collectively, ""KKR Group Partnership Units"") representing economic interests in KKR's business. The remaining KKR Group Partnership Units are held by KKR's principals through KKR Holdings L.P. (""KKR Holdings""), which is not a subsidiary of KKR. As of December 31, 2012, KKR & Co. L.P. held 36.9% of the KKR Group Partnership Units and KKR's principals held 63.1% of the KKR Group Partnership Units through KKR Holdings.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). The consolidated financial statements (referred to hereafter as the ""financial statements"") include the accounts of KKR's management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds (the ""KKR Funds"") and certain other entities. KKR consolidates the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries. KKR Holdings' ownership interest in the KKR Group Partnerships is reflected as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements. References in the accompanying financial statements to KKR's ""principals"" are to KKR's senior employees and non-employee operating consultants who hold interests in KKR's business through KKR Holdings, including those principals who also hold interests in the Managing Partner entitling those principals to vote for the election of the Managing Partners' directors (the ""Senior Principals""). Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income (loss) during the reporting periods. Such estimates include but are not limited to the valuation of investments and financial instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the financial statements. 162 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Consolidation General KKR consolidates (i) those entities in which it holds a majority voting interest or has majority ownership and control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including the KKR Funds in which KKR, as general partner, is presumed to have control, or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities (""VIEs"") for which KKR is considered the primary beneficiary. With respect to the consolidated KKR Funds, KKR generally has operational discretion and control, and limited partners have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund. The KKR Funds are consolidated by KKR notwithstanding the fact that KKR has only a minority economic interest in those funds. KKR's financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income (loss) and cash flows of the consolidated KKR Funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third party fund investors, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by KKR from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, KKR's attributable share of the net income (loss) from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR partners' capital. The KKR Funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies (""Portfolio Companies""). Rather, the KKR Funds reflect their investments at fair value as described in the Fair Value Measurements section. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Variable Interest Entities KKR consolidates all VIEs in which it is considered the primary beneficiary. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest under GAAP. A controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's business and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The consolidation rules which were revised effective January 1, 2010, require an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which KKR has a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether KKR's involvement, through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests unrelated to the holding of equity interests, would give it a controlling financial interest under GAAP. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. Where KKR has an interest in an entity that has qualified for the deferral of the consolidation rules, the analysis is based on consolidation rules prior to January 1, 2010. These rules require an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which KKR has a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether KKR's involvement, through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests would be expected to absorb a majority of the 163 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) variability of the entity. Under both guidelines, KKR determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a VIE and reconsiders that conclusion at each reporting date. In evaluating whether KKR is the primary beneficiary, KKR evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly by KKR or indirectly through related parties. The consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively; however, if it is not readily apparent that KKR is not the primary beneficiary, a quantitative analysis may also be performed. Investments and redemptions (either by KKR, affiliates of KKR or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entities could affect an entity's status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. At each reporting date, KKR assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly. KKR's accounting conclusion under the existing consolidation rules determined that effective January 1, 2011, KKR became the primary beneficiary of certain entities and consolidated such entities that were unconsolidated prior to that date. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the maximum exposure to loss for those VIEs in which KKR is determined not to be the primary beneficiary but in which it has a variable interest is as follows: December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Investments $ 188,408 $ 61,053 Due from Affiliates, net 2,266 2,095 Maximum Exposure to Loss $ 190,674 $ 63,148 For those unconsolidated VIEs in which KKR is the sponsor, KKR may have an obligation as general partner to provide commitments to such funds. For years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, KKR did not provide any support other than its obligated amount. KKR's investment strategies differ by investment fund; however, the fundamental risks have similar characteristics, including loss of invested capital and loss of management fees and carried interests. Accordingly, disaggregation of KKR's involvement with VIEs would not provide more useful information. Business Combinations Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist primarily of contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and incentive fees, and are included in Other Assets within the statements of financial condition. Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and amortization expense is included within General, Administrative and Other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. KKR does not hold any indefinite-lived intangible assets. 164 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with an acquisition. Goodwill will be assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is recorded in Other Assets within the statements of financial condition. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests represent noncontrolling interests of certain investment vehicles and funds that are subject to periodic redemption by fund investors following the expiration of a specified period of time (typically between one and three years), or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee during the period when capital may not be otherwise withdrawn.

When redeemable amounts become legally payable to fund investors, they are classified as a liability and included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For all consolidated investment vehicles and funds in which redemption rights have not been granted, noncontrolling interests are presented within Equity in the consolidated statements of financial condition as Noncontrolling Interests. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests represent (i) noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and (ii) noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings.

Noncontrolling Interests held by KKR Holdings Noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings include economic interests held by KKR's principals in the KKR Group Partnerships. KKR's principals receive financial benefits from KKR's business in the form of distributions received from KKR Holdings and through their direct and indirect participation in the value of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings. These financial benefits are not paid by KKR and are borne by KKR Holdings.

Fair Value Measurements Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated KKR Funds. The KKR Funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. KKR has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated KKR Funds in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by the KKR Funds are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. For investments and certain other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated KKR Fund, KKR has elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated KKR Funds. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated KKR Funds. 167 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Investments in unconsolidated investment vehicles are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, KKR's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment vehicles are reported at fair value, the carrying value of KKR's equity method investments approximates fair value. The carrying amounts of Other Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition (excluding Fixed Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. Further information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets is presented in Note 14 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets."" Further information on contingent consideration is presented in Note 13 ""Acquisitions."" KKR's debt obligations, except for KKR's 2020 Senior Notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value. Further information on KKR's 2020 Senior Notes is presented in Note 8, ""Debt Obligations."" The fair value for KKR's 2020 Senior Notes was derived using Level II inputs similar to those utilized in valuing fixed income investments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. See Note 5, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for further information on KKR's valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows: Level I Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt, and securities sold short. Level II Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are fixed income investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. 168 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Level III Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private Portfolio Companies and fixed income investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. KKR's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset. A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by KKR in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels I, II, and III, which KKR recognizes at the beginning of the reporting period. Investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. KKR does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where KKR holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. Level II Valuation Methodologies Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities and fixed income and other investments. Fixed income investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. KKR's policy is to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets KKR's best estimate of fair value. For debt securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some 169 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security. Level III Valuation Methodologies Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level III consist primarily of the following: Private Equity Investments: KKR generally employs two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used. Upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies. When determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, KKR considers, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. Across the Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 77% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of the Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. When determining the illiquidity discount applied, KKR evaluates each private equity investment to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment in the near-term and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. These factors include whether KKR lacks the unilateral ability to sell the portfolio company or take the portfolio company public, whether the portfolio company is currently engaged in significant restructuring activities, the size of the portfolio company, and whether the company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. Depending on the applicability of the criteria, KKR determines the amount of the illiquidity discount to be applied. 170 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Fixed Income Investments: Fixed income investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, fixed income investments are valued by KKR using internally developed valuation models. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers. Other Investments: Other investments primarily represent privately-held equity and equity-like securities (e.g. warrants) in companies that are not private equity or fixed income investments. KKR generally employs the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on KKR's Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements."" KKR utilizes several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of KKR's valuation methodologies. KKR's reported fair value estimates could vary materially if KKR had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if KKR only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies. Level III Valuation Process The valuation process involved for Level III measurements for private equity, fixed income, and other investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. KKR has a valuation committee for private equity investments and a valuation committee for fixed income and other investments. The private equity valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of natural resources and real estate investments. Each of the private equity valuation committee and the fixed income valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued. The valuation teams for natural resources and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing KKR's quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations for all Level III investments, except for certain investments other than KKR private equity investments. All preliminary valuations are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to a single committee consisting of Senior Principals involved in various aspects of the KKR business. When these valuations are approved by this single committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III 171 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of KKR's board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors. Investments Investments consist primarily of private equity, fixed income, and other investments. Investments are carried at their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Further disclosure on investments is presented in Note 4, ""Investments."" Private Equity—Consists primarily of investments in Portfolio Companies of KKR Funds and investments in infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. Fixed Income—Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans), distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in collateralized loan obligations. Other—Consists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity or fixed income investments. Securities Sold Short Whether part of a hedging transaction or a transaction in its own right, securities sold short represent obligations of KKR to deliver the specified security at the contracted price at a future point in time, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices. The liability for such securities sold short, which is recorded in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the statement of financial condition, is marked to market based on the current fair value of the underlying security at the reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These transactions may involve market risk in excess of the amount currently reflected in the accompanying statements of financial condition. Cash and Cash Equivalents KKR considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and Cash Equivalents Held at Consolidated Entities Cash and cash equivalents held at consolidated entities represents cash that, although not legally restricted, is not available to fund general liquidity needs of KKR as the use of such funds is generally limited to the investment activities of the KKR Funds. 172 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents Restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represent amounts that are held by third parties under certain of KKR's financing and derivative transactions. Due from and Due to Affiliates For purposes of classifying amounts, KKR considers its principals and their related entities, unconsolidated funds and the Portfolio Companies of its funds to be affiliates. Receivables from and payables to affiliates are recorded at their current settlement amount. Fixed Assets, Depreciation and Amortization Fixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements, furniture and computer hardware. Such amounts are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in Other Assets within the statement of financial condition. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated economic useful lives, which for leasehold improvements are the lesser of the lease terms or the life of the asset, and three to seven years for other fixed assets. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances, excluding those resulting from contributions from and distributions to owners. In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, comprehensive income represents Net Income (Loss), as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and net foreign currency translation adjustments. Derivatives Derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to foreign currencies and credit standing of reference entities to manage foreign exchange risk and credit risk arising from certain assets and liabilities. All derivatives are recognized in Other Assets or Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. KKR's derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that its counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. KKR attempts to minimize this risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Fees Fees consist primarily of (i) monitoring and consulting fees from providing advisory and other services, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and separately managed accounts, and (iii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the 173 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, fees consisted of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Transaction Fees $ 237,089 $ 343,249 $ 212,527 Monitoring & Consulting Fees 192,658 265,927 119,242 Management Fees 98,144 80,201 64,785 Incentive Fees 40,551 34,243 38,832 Total Fees $ 568,442 $ 723,620 $ 435,386 Substantially all fees presented in the table above are earned from affiliates. Transaction Fees Transaction fees are earned by KKR primarily in connection with successful investment transactions and capital markets activities. Transaction fees are recognized upon closing of the transaction. Fees are typically paid on or around the closing of a transaction. In connection with pursuing successful Portfolio Company investments, KKR receives reimbursement for certain transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses, which are reimbursed by third parties, are typically deferred until the transaction is consummated and are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition on the date incurred. The costs of successfully completed transactions are borne by the KKR Funds and included as a component of the investment's cost basis. Subsequent to closing, investments are recorded at fair value each reporting period as described in the section above titled ""Investments"". Upon reimbursement from a third party, the cash receipt is recorded and the deferred amounts are relieved. No fees or expenses are recorded for these reimbursements. Monitoring and Consulting Fees Monitoring fees are earned by KKR for services provided to Portfolio Companies and are recognized as services are rendered. These fees are generally paid based on a fixed periodic schedule by the Portfolio Companies either in advance or in arrears and are separately negotiated for each Portfolio Company. In connection with the monitoring of Portfolio Companies and certain unconsolidated funds, KKR receives reimbursement for certain expenses incurred on behalf of these entities. Costs incurred in monitoring these entities are classified as general, administrative and other expenses and reimbursements of such costs are classified as monitoring fees. In addition, certain monitoring fee provisions may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. 174 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Consulting fees are earned by certain consolidated entities for consulting services provided to Portfolio Companies and other companies and are recognized as the services are rendered. These fees are separately negotiated with each company for which services are provided. Management Fees Management fees are earned by KKR for management services provided to private equity funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance vehicles and other investment vehicles which are recognized in the period during which the related services are performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the related agreement. Management fees earned from private equity funds and certain investment vehicles are based upon a percentage of capital committed during the investment period, and thereafter based on remaining invested capital. For certain other investment vehicles, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts and a specialty finance vehicle, management fees are recognized in the period during which the related services are performed and are based upon the net asset value, gross assets or as otherwise defined in the respective agreements. Management fees received from consolidated KKR Funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, KKR's allocated share of the net income from consolidated KKR Funds is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination of these fees does not have an effect on the net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR partners' capital. Private Equity Funds For KKR's consolidated and unconsolidated private equity funds, gross management fees generally range from 1% to 2% of committed capital during the fund's investment period and is generally 0.75% of invested capital after the expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time. Typically, an investment period is defined as a period of up to six years. The actual length of the investment period may be shorter based on the timing and deployment of committed capital. Certain of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the earned cash management fees, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements. KKR Financial Holdings LLC (""KFN"") KKR's management agreement with KFN entitles KKR to a base management fee. KKR earns a base management fee, computed and payable monthly in arrears, based on an annual rate of 1.75% of adjusted equity, which is an amount defined in the management agreement. 175 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Structured Finance Vehicles KKR's management agreements for its structured finance vehicles provide for senior collateral management fees and subordinate collateral management fees. Senior collateral management fees are determined based on an annual rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.20% of collateral and subordinate collateral management fees are determined based on an annual rate ranging from 0.30% to 0.35% of collateral. If amounts distributable on any payment date are insufficient to pay the collateral management fees according to the priority of payments, any shortfall is deferred and payable on subsequent payment dates. KKR has the right to waive all or any portion of any collateral management fee. As of December 31, 2012, KKR has permanently waived $169.3 million of collateral management fees. KKR generally waives the collateral management fees for the majority of its structured finance vehicles; however, KKR may cease waiving collateral management fees at its discretion. For the purpose of calculating the collateral management fees, collateral, the payment dates, and the priority of payments are terms defined in the management agreements. Other Investment Vehicles Certain other investment vehicles that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, (ii) liquid long/short equity strategies, (iii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments and direct senior lending and (iv) hedge funds solutions provide for management fees determined quarterly based on an annual rate generally ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%. Such rate may be based on the investment vehicles average net asset value, capital commitments, or invested capital. Incentive Fees KFN KKR's management agreement with KFN entitles KKR to quarterly incentive fees. KKR records the KFN performance-based incentive fee, if any, when the performance-based incentive fee becomes fixed and determinable, which is quarterly. The quarterly incentive fee is an amount equal to the product of (i) 25% of the dollar amount by which: (a) KFN's net income, before incentive compensation, per weighted average share of KFN's common shares for such quarter, exceeds (b) an amount equal to (A) the weighted average of the price per share of the common stock of KFN in its August 2004 private placement and the prices per share of the common stock of KFN in its initial public offering and any subsequent offerings by KFN multiplied by (B) the greater of (1) 2.00% and (2) 0.50% plus one-fourth of the ten year treasury rate for such quarter, multiplied by (ii) the weighted average number of KFN's common shares outstanding in such quarter. The incentive fee is paid quarterly in arrears and is not subject to any hurdle or clawback provisions. The management agreement with KFN was renewed on January 1, 2013 and will automatically be renewed for successive one-year terms following December 31, 2013 unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 176 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Hedge Fund Structures Incentive fees earned on the performance of certain hedge fund structures are recognized based on fund performance, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, and/or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each fund's governing agreements. Incentive fee rates generally range from 5% to 20%. KKR does not record performance-based incentive fees until the end of each fund's measurement period (which is generally one year) when the performance-based incentive fees become fixed and determinable. Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments which are recorded in net gains (losses) from investment activities, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt which are recorded in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. Dividend Income Dividend income is recognized by KKR on the ex-dividend date, or in the absence of a formal declaration, on the date it is received. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the majority of dividends were earned by the consolidated KKR Funds. Interest Income Interest income is recognized as earned. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the majority of interest income was earned by the consolidated KKR Funds. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from credit facilities entered into by KKR, debt issued by KKR, and debt outstanding at the KKR funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow, which are not direct obligations of the general partners of the KKR funds or management companies. In addition to these interest costs, KKR capitalizes debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and Benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. 177 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) All KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution. Further disclosure regarding equity based compensation is presented in Note 10 ""Equity Based Compensation."" Profit Sharing Plan KKR provides certain profit sharing programs for KKR employees and other eligible personnel. In particular, KKR provides a 401(k) plan (the ""Plan"") for eligible employees in the United States. For certain professionals who are participants in the Plan, KKR may, in its discretion, contribute an amount after the end of the Plan year. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, KKR incurred expenses of $4.6 million, $4.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in connection with the Plan. Carry Pool Allocation With respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR will allocate to its principals and other professionals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the statement of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation expense for KKR employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 12 ""Segment Reporting"" for the amount of carry pool allocation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Carried Interest Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduce noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where 178 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Carried interest is recognized based on the contractual formula set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund was terminated at the reporting date with the then estimated fair values of the investments realized. Due to the extended durations of KKR's private equity funds and other investment vehicles, KKR believes that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects the periodic performance of KKR in the management of those funds. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 12 ""Segment Reporting"" for the amount of carried interest income earned or reversed for years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The agreements governing KKR's private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" or, in certain instances, a ""net loss sharing"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See Note 15 ""Commitments and Contingencies"". General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges and costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions. Foreign Currency Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are primarily held at management and capital markets companies located outside the United States. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Results of foreign operations are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for each reporting period. Translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Foreign currency gains or losses resulting from transactions outside of the functional currency of a consolidated entity are recorded as incurred in general, administrative and other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Per Common Unit Basic Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period. 179 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional common units that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common units had been issued. Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit exclude KKR Holdings units which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common units of KKR & Co. L.P. The KKR Holdings units are excluded from the diluted calculation since the exchange of these units would proportionally increase KKR & Co. L.P.'s interests in the KKR Group Partnerships and would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common unit as a result of certain tax benefits KKR & Co. L.P. is assumed to receive upon the exchange. Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit include unvested equity awards that have been granted under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (""Equity Incentive Plan"") since these equity awards dilute KKR and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. Further disclosure regarding Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is presented in Note 6 ""Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Per Common Unit."" Income Taxes The consolidated entities of KKR are generally treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. and non-U.S. tax purposes. However, certain consolidated subsidiaries are treated as corporations for U.S. and non-U.S tax purposes and are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state and/or local income taxes at the entity-level. In addition, certain consolidated entities which are treated as partnerships for U.S. tax purposes are subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax or other local taxes. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets, which are recorded in Other Assets within the statement of financial condition, are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset and presented as a single amount within Other Assets or Accounts Payable, Accrued and Other Liabilities, as applicable, in the accompanying statements of financial position. KKR analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, KKR determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. KKR recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. 180 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) KKR records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process: (a) determination is made whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (b) those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Tax Receivable Agreement KKR and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to the exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in KKR's intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in KKR's intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in KKR's business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax KKR's intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. KKR has entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires KKR's intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to executives who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR common units (as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units), 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that KKR would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of KKR's current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if KKR becomes taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, KKR expects that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. These payment obligations are obligations of KKR's intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by current and former holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings and KKR's principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of KKR's intermediate holding companies which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. 181 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) As of December 31, 2012, approximately $2.9 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. KKR expects its intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31, 2012, $0.5 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Measurements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, ""Fair Value Measurement"" (""ASU 2011-04""), which amended Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 to clarify existing guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2011-04 requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level III fair value measurements and provide additional disclosures for classes of assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value. As a result of adopting ASU 2011-04, KKR has expanded its fair value disclosures. See section ""Fair Value Measurements"" above and Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements"". Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, ""Statement of Comprehensive Income"" (""ASU 2011-05""), which requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012 and was applied retrospectively. The standard did not impact KKR's reported results of operations but did impact the financial statement presentation. KKR has adopted the presentation of total comprehensive income in two consecutive statements. See the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, ""Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities"" (""ASU 2011-11""), which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. Disclosures About Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, ""Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""),"" which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including (i) changes in AOCI balances by component and (ii) significant items reclassified out of AOCI. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year 182 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, ""Intangibles—Goodwill and Other,"" which provides the option to perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, an entity is required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance. The guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is intended to simplify the impairment testing, is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. 3. NET GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations consist primarily of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments (including foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to foreign denominated investments and related activities) and other financial instruments, including those for which the fair value option has been elected. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in the fair value of these investments and other financial instruments during a period. Upon disposition of an investment or financial instrument, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. 183 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

(2)The Transfers Out noted in the tables above for private equity investments is attributable to Portfolio Companies that completed an initial public offering during the period. In addition, the Transfers Out noted above for fixed income and other investments are principally attributable to certain investments that experienced a higher level of market activity during the period and thus were valued using observable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded for Level III investments are reported in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no transfers between Level I and Level II during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 188 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) The following table presents additional information about valuation methodologies and inputs used for investments that are measured at fair value and categorized within Level III as of December 31, 2012: Fair Value Impact to Valuation from an Increase in Input(3) December 31, 2012 Valuation Methodologies Unobservable Input(s)(1) Weighted Average(2) Range Private equity investments $ 27,653,647 (9) Inputs to both Illiquidity Discount 9% 0% - 20%(6) Decrease market comparable Weight Ascribed to Market Comparables 47% 0% - 100% (4) and discounted cash Weight Ascribed to Discounted Cash Flow 53% 0% - 100% (5) flow Market comparables Enterprise Value/LTM EBITDA Multiple 10x 5x - 15x(7) Increase Enterprise Value/Forward EBITDA Multiple 9x 5x - 13x(7) Increase Control Premium 0% 0% - 20%(8) Increase Discounted cash flow Weighted Average Cost of Capital 10% 6% - 25% Decrease Enterprise Value/LTM EBITDA Exit Multiple 9x 5x - 13x Increase Fixed income investments $ 1,587,046 (10) Yield Analysis Discount Margin 1197 bps 414 - 4510 bps Decrease Yield 13% 5% - 46% Decrease Net Leverage 6x 1x - 12x Decrease Illiquidity Discount 3% 0% - 15% Decrease (1)In determining certain of these inputs, management evaluates a variety of factors including economic conditions, industry and market developments, market valuations of comparable companies and company specific developments including exit strategies and realization opportunities. Management has determined that market participants would take these inputs into account when valuing the investments. LTM means Last Twelve Months and EBITDA means Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization. (2)Inputs were weighted based on the fair value of the investments included in the range. (3)Unless otherwise noted, this column represents the directional change in the fair value of the Level III investments that would result from an increase to the corresponding unobservable input. A decrease to the unobservable input would have the opposite effect. Significant increases and decreases in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. (4)The directional change from an increase in the weight ascribed to the market comparables approach would increase the fair value of the Level III investments if the market comparables approach results in a higher valuation than the discounted cash flow approach. The opposite would be true if the market comparables approach results in a lower valuation than the discounted cash flow approach. (5)The directional change from an increase in the weight ascribed to the discounted cash flow approach would increase the fair value of the Level III investments if the discounted cash flow approach results in a higher valuation than the market comparables approach. The opposite would be true if the discounted cash flow approach results in a lower valuation than the market comparables approach. (6)All private equity investments are assigned a minimum 5% illiquidity discount, with the exception of investments in KKR's natural resources strategy. (7)Ranges shown exclude inputs relating to a single portfolio company that was determined to lack comparability with other investments in KKR's private equity portfolio. This portfolio company had a fair value representing less than 0.5% of the total fair value of Private Equity Investments and had an Enterprise Value/LTM EBITDA Multiple and Enterprise Value/Forward EBITDA Multiple of 29x and 22x, respectively. The exclusion of this investment does not impact the weighted average. (8)Level III private equity investments whose valuations include a control premium represent less than 1% of total Level III private equity investments. The valuations for the remaining investments do not include a control premium. (9)Amounts include $161.5 million of investments whose valuation inputs are not directly comparable to other private equity investments, and as such the inputs associated with these investments have been excluded from this table. These investments have a fair value representing less than 1% of the total fair value of private equity investments. (10)Amounts include $226.1 million of investments that were valued using dealer quotes or third party valuation firms. The table above excludes Other Investments in the amount of $245.0 million comprised primarily of privately-held equity and equity-like securities (e.g. warrants) in companies that are neither private 189 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued) equity nor fixed income investments. These investments were valued using Level III valuation methodologies that are generally the same as those shown for private equity investments. The various unobservable inputs used to determine the Level III valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. Significant increases and decreases in these inputs in isolation and interrelationships between those inputs could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements as noted in the table above. 6.

L.P. per common unit since the exchange of these units would proportionally increase KKR & Co. L.P.'s interests in the KKR Group Partnerships and would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common unit as a result of certain tax benefits KKR & Co. L.P. is assumed to receive upon the exchange. Diluted Net Income (Loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit include unvested equity awards that have been granted under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan since these equity awards dilute KKR and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. 190 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

DEBT OBLIGATIONS Debt obligations consist of the following: December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Investment Financing Arrangements $ 625,026 $ 1,066,536 2020 Senior Notes 498,388 498,180 $ 1,123,414 $ 1,564,716 Investment Financing Arrangements Certain of KKR's investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements with major financial institutions, generally in connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns. These financing arrangements are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of KKR's investment vehicles or its management companies. As of December 31, 2011, $796.4 million of financing was outstanding that was structured through the use of total return swaps which effectively convert third party capital contributions into borrowings of KKR. During May 2012, KKR entered into an agreement for an early redemption of one such financing arrangement. The terms of the agreement included a full repayment of the financing at par, which amounted to $625.0 million. During October 2012, KKR repaid the principal and accrued interest on the remaining $171.4 million outstanding financing in connection with the maturity of the underlying investment. As of December 31, 2012, there are no borrowings outstanding for financing arrangements structured through the use of total return swaps. 193 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 8. DEBT OBLIGATIONS (Continued) As of December 31, 2011, $182.2 million of financing was outstanding that was structured through the use of a syndicated term and a revolving credit facility (the ""Term Facility"") that matures in August 2014. During November 2012, KKR repaid $101.3 million of the outstanding financing. The per annum rate of interest for each borrowing under the Term Facility was equal to the Bloomberg United States Dollar Interest Rate Swap Ask Rate plus 1.75% at the time of each borrowing under the Term Facility through March 11, 2010. On March 11, 2010, the Term Facility was amended and the per annum rate of interest was the greater of the 5-year interest rate swap rate plus 1.75% or 4.65% for periods from March 12, 2010 to June 7, 2012. For the period June 8, 2012 through maturity the interest rate is equal to one year LIBOR plus 1.75%. The per annum interest rate at December 31, 2012 on the borrowings outstanding of $80.9 million was 2.82%. This financing arrangement is non-recourse to KKR beyond the specific assets pledged as collateral. In April 2011, one of KKR's private equity investment vehicles entered into a revolving credit facility with a major financial institution (the ""Revolver Facility"") with respect to a specific private equity investment. The Revolver Facility provides for up to $50.1 million of financing and matures on the first anniversary of the agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event based on the value of the collateral and events of default, KKR may be required to provide additional collateral. KKR has the option to extend the agreement for an additional two years provided the value of the investment meets certain defined financial ratios. On April 5, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the Revolver Facility to April 4, 2014. In addition, KKR may request to increase the commitment to the Revolver Facility up to $75.1 million, subject to lender approval and provided the value of the investment meets certain defined financial ratios. The per annum rate of interest for each borrowing under the Revolver Facility is equal to the Hong Kong interbank market rate plus 3.75%. The interest rate at December 31, 2012 on the borrowings outstanding was 4.30%. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $40.9 million and $40.8 million, respectively, of borrowings were outstanding under the Revolver Facility. This financing arrangement is non-recourse to KKR beyond the specific assets pledged as collateral. During May 2011, a KKR investment vehicle entered into a $200.0 million non-recourse multi-currency three-year revolving credit agreement that bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% (the ""Mezzanine Investment Credit Agreement""). The Mezzanine Investment Credit Agreement is expected to be used to manage timing differences between capital calls from limited partners in the investment vehicle and funding of investment opportunities and to borrow in foreign currencies for purposes of hedging the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar investments. On June 18, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the Mezzanine Investment Credit Agreement to May 15, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $202.9 million was drawn down and $114.1 million was repaid. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $143.7 million and $47.1 million, respectively, of borrowings were outstanding under the Mezzanine Investment Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Mezzanine Investment Credit Agreement was 2.90%. This financing arrangement is non-recourse to KKR beyond the specific assets and capital commitments pledged as collateral. In November 2011, a KKR investment vehicle entered into a $200.0 million five-year borrowing base revolving credit facility (the ""2011 Lending Partners Credit Agreement""). KKR has the option to extend the credit facility for up to two additional years. In addition, KKR may request to increase the 194 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P.

DEBT OBLIGATIONS (Continued) commitment to the credit facility up to $400.0 million when the ratio of the loan commitments to committed equity capital is 1.50:1. On April 2, 2012, KKR increased the commitment to the credit facility to $400.0 million. The per annum rate of interest for each borrowing under the 2011 Lending Partners Credit Agreement ranges from LIBOR plus 1.75% for broadly syndicated loans and LIBOR plus 2.75% for all other loans until November 15, 2016 and thereafter, LIBOR plus 4.00% per annum for all loans. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $200.2 million was drawn down and $30.2 million was repaid. As of December 31, 2012, $170.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the 2011 Lending Partners Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2011 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2011 Lending Partners Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the 2011 Lending Partners Credit Agreement was 2.97%. In January 2013, this KKR investment vehicle entered into a $150.0 million 5-year borrowing base revolving credit facility (the ""2013 Lending Partners Credit Agreement""). KKR has the option to extend the credit facility for one additional year. The per annum rate of interest for borrowings under the 2013 Lending Partners Credit Agreement shall be the applicable spread plus libor rate as stated in the credit facility agreement. This financing arrangement is non-recourse to KKR beyond the specific assets pledged as collateral. In December 2011, a KKR investment vehicle entered into a $66.5 million (€50.0 million) one-year borrowing base revolving credit facility that bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% (the ""Investment Credit Agreement""). In December 2012, KKR renewed the revolving credit facility for one year. The Investment Credit Agreement is expected to be used to manage timing differences between capital calls and the funding of investment opportunities. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $69.7 million was drawn down and $26.6 million was repaid. As of December 31, 2012, $39.5 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Investment Credit Agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Investment Credit Agreement was 1.97%. This financing arrangement is non-recourse to KKR beyond the specific assets and capital commitments pledged as collateral. In January 2012, a KKR investment vehicle entered into a $200.0 million three-year borrowing base revolving credit facility (the ""KKR Debt Investors II Investment Credit Agreement""). As of December 31, 2012, $150 million of borrowings were outstanding under the KKR Debt Investors II Investment Credit Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $150.0 million was drawn down and remains outstanding as of December 31, 2012.

KKR Revolving Credit Agreements Corporate Credit Agreement On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement""). The Corporate Credit Agreement originally provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. On February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit facility was reduced from $1.0 billion to $700.0 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the issuer of the 2020 Senior Notes became guarantors of the amended and restated Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of KKR's private equity funds. On June 3, 2011, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50.0 million. This commitment has increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750.0 million. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under the Corporate Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2012, no amounts were drawn under the credit facility. On June 22, 2012, KKR requested the issuance of a letter of credit in the amount of $14.5 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement in connection with a fee-generating transaction. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is an unaffiliated third party. The letter of credit was issued on July 2, 2012 and was initially set to expire on July 3, 2013. On August 20, 2012, the letter of credit in connection with this fee-generating transaction was increased to $20.0 million and the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2013. A $5.0 million sublimit for letters of credit remains available under the Corporate Credit Agreement. KCM Credit Agreement On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a revolving credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement"") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. On March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition to extending the term, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a 197 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P.

INCOME TAXES (Continued) KKR files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, KKR is subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2012, the federal, state and local tax returns of KKR and its predecessor entities for the years 2009 through 2011 are open under normal statute of limitations and are therefore subject to examination. At December 31, 2012, 2011and 2010, KKR's unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Unrecognized Tax Benefits, beginning of period $ 3,850 $ 3,973 $ 4,640 Gross increases in tax positions in prior periods 31 175 — Gross decreases in tax positions in prior periods — — (1,722 ) Gross increases in tax positions in current period 985 555 1,227 Gross decreases in tax positions in current period — — — Settlement of tax positions — — — Lapse of statute of limitations (239 ) (853 ) (172 ) Unrecognized Tax Benefits, end of period $ 4,627 $ 3,850 $ 3,973 If the above tax benefits were recognized it would reduce the annual effective income tax rate. KKR believes that there will not be a significant increase or decrease to the tax positions within 12 months of the reporting date. The unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. KKR recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax positions in income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, interest and penalties included in KKR's tax provision were immaterial. 10. EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION The following table summarizes the expense associated with equity based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 KKR Holdings Principal Awards $ 230,394 $ 324,014 $ 622,018 KKR Holdings Restricted Equity Units 9,588 16,848 65,524 Equity Incentive Plan Units 62,876 16,615 — Discretionary Compensation 97,349 112,744 136,651 Total $ 400,207 $ 470,221 $ 824,193 200 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 10. EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) KKR Holdings Equity Awards—Principal Awards KKR principals and certain non-employee consultants and service providers received grants of KKR Holdings units which are exchangeable for KKR Group Partnership Units. These units are subject to minimum retained ownership requirements and in certain cases, transfer restrictions, and allow for their exchange into common units of KKR & Co. L.P. on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, KKR Holdings owned approximately 63.1%, or 432,553,276 and 66.8%, or 456,214,235, respectively, of the outstanding KKR Group Partnership Units. Except for any units that vested on the date of grant, units are subject to service based vesting, generally over a three to five year period from the date of grant. The transfer restriction period will generally last for a minimum of (i) one year with respect to one-half of the interests vesting on any vesting date and (ii) two years with respect to the other one-half of the interests vesting on such vesting date. While providing services to KKR, these individuals will also be subject to minimum retained ownership rules requiring them to continuously hold at least 25% of their vested interests. Upon separation from KKR, certain individuals will be subject to the terms of a non-compete agreement that may require the forfeiture of certain vested and unvested units should the terms of the non-compete agreement be violated. Holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held through KKR Holdings are not entitled to participate in distributions made on KKR Group Partnership Units until such units are vested. Because KKR Holdings is a partnership, all of the 432,553,276 KKR Holdings units have been legally allocated, but the allocation of 29,438,740 of these units has not been communicated to each respective principal. The units that have not been communicated are subject to performance based vesting conditions, which include profitability and other similar criteria. These criteria are not sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes, and the achievement, or lack thereof, will be determined based upon the exercise of judgment by the general partner of KKR Holdings. Each principal will ultimately receive between zero and 100% of the units initially allocated. The allocation of these units has not yet been communicated to the award recipients as this was management's decision on how to best incentivize its principals. It is anticipated that additional service-based vesting conditions will be imposed at the time the allocation is initially communicated to the respective principals. KKR applied the guidance of Accounting Standards Code (""ASC"") 718 and concluded that these KKR Holdings units do not yet meet the criteria for recognition of compensation cost because neither the grant date nor the service inception date has occurred. In reaching a conclusion that the service inception date has not occurred, KKR considered (a) the fact that the vesting conditions are not sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes, (b) the significant judgment that can be exercised by the general partner of KKR Holdings in determining whether the vesting conditions are ultimately achieved, and (c) the absence of communication to the principals of any information related to the number of units they were initially allocated. The allocation of these units will be communicated to the award recipients when the performance-based vesting conditions have been met, and currently there is no plan as to when the communication will occur. The determination as to whether the award recipients have satisfied the performance-based vesting conditions is made by the general partner of KKR Holdings, and is based on multiple factors primarily related to the award recipients' individual performance. 201 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 10. EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) The fair value of KKR Holdings unit grants is based on the closing price of KKR & Co. L.P. common units on the date of grant. KKR determined this to be the best evidence of fair value as a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit is traded in an active market and has an observable market price. Additionally, a KKR Holdings unit is an instrument with terms and conditions similar to those of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. Specifically, units in both KKR Holdings and KKR & Co. L.P. represent ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership Units and, subject to any vesting, minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions referenced above, each KKR Holdings unit is exchangeable into a KKR Group Partnership Unit and then into a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on a one-for-one basis. Units granted to principals give rise to equity-based payment charges in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For units vesting on the grant date, expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on the grant date multiplied by the number of vested units. Equity-based payment expense on unvested units is calculated based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit at the time of grant, discounted for the lack of participation rights in the expected distributions on unvested units which currently ranges from 7% to 52%, multiplied by the number of unvested units on the grant date. The grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. unit reflects a discount for lack of distribution participation rights because equity awards are not entitled to receive distributions while unvested. The discount range was based on management's estimates of future distributions that unvested equity awards will not be entitled to receive between the grant date and the vesting date. Therefore, units that vest in the earlier periods have a lower discount as compared to units that vest in later periods, which have a higher discount. The discount range will generally increase when the level of expected annual distributions increases relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. A decrease in expected annual distributions relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit would generally have the opposite effect. Units granted to certain non-employee consultants and service providers give rise to general, administrative and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations. For units vesting on the grant date, expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on the grant date multiplied by the number of vested units. General, administrative and other expense recognized on unvested units is calculated based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on each reporting date and subsequently adjusted for the actual fair value of the award at each vesting date. Accordingly, the measured value of these units will not be finalized until each vesting date. The calculation of equity-based payment expense and general administrative and other expense on unvested units assumes a forfeiture rate of up to 4% annually based upon expected turnover by class of principal, consultant, or service provider. As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $146.4 million of estimated unrecognized equity-based payment and general administrative and other expense related to unvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.8 years, using the graded attribution method, which treats each vesting portion as a separate award. 202 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

These grants will be funded by KKR Holdings and will not dilute KKR's interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. The vesting of these restricted equity units occur in installments, generally over a three to five year period from the date of grant. Units granted to professionals, support staff and other personnel are measured and recognized on a basis similar to KKR Holdings equity awards except that the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit at the time of grant is not discounted for the lack of distribution participation rights since unvested units are entitled to distributions. The calculation assumes a forfeiture rate of up to 4% annually based upon expected turnover by class of professionals, support staff, and other personnel. As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $3.8 million of estimated unrecognized expense related to unvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years, using the graded attribution method, which treats each vesting portion as a separate award. 203 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan Under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, KKR is permitted to grant equity awards representing ownership interests in KKR & Co. L.P. common units. Vested awards under the Equity Incentive Plan dilute KKR & Co. L.P. common unitholders and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. The total number of common units that may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan is equivalent to 15% of the number of fully diluted common units outstanding, subject to annual adjustment. As of December 31, 2012, equity awards relating to 21,509,666 KKR & Co. L.P. common units have been granted under the Equity Incentive Plan and are subject to service based vesting, which vest generally over a three to five year period from the date of grant. In certain cases, these awards are subject to transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements. The transfer restriction period, if applicable, lasts for (i) one year with respect to one-half of the interests vesting on any vesting date and (ii) two years with respect to the other one-half of the interests vesting on such vesting date. While providing services to KKR, if applicable, certain of these individuals are also subject to 204 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P.

EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION (Continued) minimum retained ownership rules requiring them to continuously hold common unit equivalents equal to at least 15% of their cumulatively vested interests. Expense associated with the vesting of these awards is based on the closing price of the KKR & Co. L.P. common units on the date of grant, discounted for the lack of participation rights in the expected distributions on unvested units, which currently ranges from 7% to 52% multiplied by the number of unvested units on the grant date. The grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. unit reflects a discount for lack of distribution participation rights because equity awards are not entitled to receive distributions while unvested. The discount range was based on management's estimates of future distributions that unvested equity awards will not be entitled to receive between the grant date and the vesting date. Therefore, units that vest in the earlier periods have a lower discount as compared to units that vest in later periods, which have a higher discount. The discount range will generally increase when the level of expected annual distributions increases relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. A decrease in expected annual distributions relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit would generally have the opposite effect. Expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the award and assumes a forfeiture rate of up to 4% annually based upon expected turnover by class of recipient. As of December 31, 2012, there was approximately $126.5 million of estimated unrecognized expense related to unvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years, using the straight line method.

While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution. 11.

KFN KFN is a publicly traded specialty finance company whose limited liability company interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol ""KFN."" KFN is managed by KKR but is not consolidated by KKR. KFN was organized in August 2004 and completed its initial public offering on June 24, 2005. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, KFN had consolidated assets of $8.4 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, and shareholders' equity of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Shares of KFN held by KKR represented 0.1% of KFN's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2012. There were no outstanding shares of KFN held by KKR as of December 31, 2011. If KKR were to exercise all of its outstanding vested options, KKR's ownership interest in KFN would be 0.35% and 0.34% of KFN's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Discretionary Investments Certain of KKR's investment professionals, including its principals and other qualifying employees, are permitted to invest, and have invested, their own capital in side-by-side investments with KKR's investment vehicles. Side-by-side investments are made on the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable investment vehicle, except that the side-by-side investments are not subject to management fees, incentive fees or a carried interest. The cash invested by these individuals aggregated $108.9 million, $227.8 million and $66.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Aircraft and Other Services Certain of the Senior Principals own aircraft that KKR uses for business purposes in the ordinary course of its operations. These Senior Principals paid for the purchase of these aircraft with personal funds and bear all operating, personnel and maintenance costs associated with their operation. The hourly rates that KKR pays for the use of these aircraft are based on current market rates for chartering private aircraft of the same type.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued) Facilities Certain of the Senior Principals are partners in a real-estate based partnership that maintains an ownership interest in KKR's Menlo Park location. Payments made to this partnership were $6.8 million, $6.5 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 12. SEGMENT REPORTING KKR operates through three reportable business segments. These segments, which are differentiated primarily by their investment objectives and strategies, consist of the following: Private Markets Through the Private Markets segment, KKR manages and sponsors a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. KKR also manages and sources investments in infrastructure, natural resources and real estate. These investment funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. Public Markets Through the Public Markets segment, KKR manages KKR Financial Holdings LLC, or KFN, which is a specialty finance company, as well as a number of investment funds, structured finance vehicles and separately managed accounts that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, (ii) liquid long/short equity strategies, (iii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments and direct senior lending and (iv) hedge funds solutions. Many of these funds, vehicles and accounts, including three management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, are managed by KKR Asset Management LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. KKR's hedge fund solutions strategies are managed by Prisma Capital Partners LP, an SEC registered investment adviser. Capital Markets and Principal Activities The Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with its global capital markets business. KKR's capital markets business supports the firm, its portfolio companies and select third parties by providing tailored capital markets advice and by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments and companies seeking financing. KKR's capital markets services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings, structuring new investment products and providing capital markets services. KKR's principal asset base primarily includes investments in its private equity funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such private equity funds, general partner interests in various KKR-sponsored investment funds, and other principal assets. Key Performance Measures The non-GAAP segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of 208 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 12. SEGMENT REPORTING (Continued) each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and as such represents the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds that KKR manages. FRE FRE is comprised of segment operating revenues less segment operating expenses and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments before investment income. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. ENI ENI is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations and management fee refunds; less (iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes. Book Value Book Value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR's investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as KKR's overall liquidity position. Book value differs from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. 209 Table of Contents KKR & CO.

At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31, 2012, there is no carried interest subject to management fee refunds, which may reduce carried interest in future periods. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements.

ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Prisma On October 1, 2012, KKR completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (""Prisma""). Prisma is a provider of customized hedge fund solutions mainly through the management of funds of hedge fund portfolios. The addition of Prisma provides KKR with a new funds of hedge fund strategy and a greater presence in the hedge funds space, from which KKR can create and offer more liquid products for KKR's fund investors. Initial consideration transferred was $200.0 million in cash, and KKR may also become obligated to make future additional payments (referred to hereafter as ""contingent consideration"") to the sellers (certain of which are now employees of KKR) in years 2014 and 2017 based on the Prisma business achieving certain performance metrics when measured in such years. KKR has the right in its sole discretion to pay a portion of the contingent consideration, if any, in KKR & Co. L.P. common units rather than in cash. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized within General, Administrative and Other in the consolidated statements of operations. The following is a summary of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 13,141 Other Assets 6,652 Intangible Assets 181,000 Goodwill 89,000 Total Assets $ 289,793 Liabilities Assumed $ 18,493 Total Liabilities $ 18,493 As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated to be $71.3 million and has been recorded as a liability within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of the contingent consideration was derived using Level III inputs. This amount was determined based on the present value of a range of undiscounted cash flows of $0 to $155.0 million in each of 2014 and 2017, using a discount rate ranging from 2.1% to 3.1%, after applying probability, risk-weighting, and other adjustments that KKR has determined to be applicable. The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes the financial results of Prisma since the date of acquisition, October 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. During this period, Prisma's fees and net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. were $17.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. This net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. reflects amortization of intangible assets and equity based compensation charges associated with Prisma since the date of the acquisition. Additionally, the portion of net income that is allocable to KKR reflects KKR's approximate 36.9% ownership interest in the KKR Group Partnerships after applicable corporate and local income taxes. On a segment basis, the financial results of Prisma are included within the Public Markets segment. 219 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 13. ACQUISITIONS (Continued) The information that follows provides supplemental information about pro forma fees and net income (loss) attributable to KKR and Co. L.P. as if the acquisition of Prisma had been consummated as of January 1, 2011. Such information is unaudited and is based on estimates and assumptions which KKR believes are reasonable. These results are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated statements of operations in future periods or the results that would have actually been realized had KKR and Prisma been a combined entity during 2012 and 2011. On a pro forma basis for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, (i) fees would be estimated to be $612.8 million and $782.0 million, respectively, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. would be estimated to be $563.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively, (iii) net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit—basic would be estimated to be $2.36 and $0.02, respectively, and (iv) net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit—diluted would be estimated to be $2.22 and $0.02, respectively. KKR incurred $3.7 million of acquisition related costs which were expensed as incurred and are reflected within General, Administrative and Other Expense on the consolidated statement of operations. 14. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill Goodwill from the acquisition of Prisma represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and is primarily attributed to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. The carrying value of goodwill was $89.0 million as of December 31, 2012 and is recorded within Other Assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition. This goodwill has been allocated entirely to the Public Markets Segment. As of December 31, 2012, the fair value of KKR's operating segments substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. All of the goodwill is currently expected to be deductible for tax purposes. See Note 7 ""Other Assets and Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities.""

The intangible assets as of December 31, 2012 are expected to amortize over a weighted-average period of 11.0 years. 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Debt Covenants Borrowings of KKR contain various debt covenants. These covenants do not, in management's opinion, materially restrict KKR's investment or financing strategies. KKR is in compliance with its debt covenants in all material respects. Investment Commitments As of December 31, 2012, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $677.9 million to its active private equity and other investment vehicles, (ii) $125.0 million to KKR Asian Fund II L.P. for which the investment period has not yet commenced, subject to adjustment, and (iii) $94.2 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business related to credit facilities of Portfolio Companies and other companies. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding. Non-cancelable Operating Leases KKR's non-cancelable operating leases consist primarily of leases of office space around the world. There are no material rent holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives associated with any of these property leases. In addition to base rentals, certain lease agreements are subject to escalation provisions and rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. 221 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) As of December 31, 2012, the approximate aggregate minimum future lease payments, net of sublease income, required on the operating leases are as follows: 2013 $ 44,087 2014 42,226 2015 41,870 2016 41,855 2017 and Thereafter 162,998 Total minimum payments required $ 333,036 Contingent Repayment Guarantees The instruments governing KKR's private equity funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the limited partners at the end of the life of the fund. Under a ""clawback"" provision, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of KKR's investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions prior to October 1, 2009 with respect to the private equity funds had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of the private equity funds to repay amounts to fund limited partners pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. KKR principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to October 1, 2009, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. As of December 31, 2012, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by KKR principals who do not hold direct controlling economic interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. Carry distributions arising subsequent to October 1, 2009 may give rise to clawback obligations that will be allocated generally to carry pool 222 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) participants and KKR. KKR will indemnify its principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. As of December 31, 2012, the amount of carried interest that is subject to this clawback provision was $1,095.4 million, assuming that all applicable private equity funds were liquidated at no value. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at their December 31, 2012 fair values, there would have been no clawback obligation. The instruments governing certain of KKR's private equity funds may also include a ""net loss sharing provision,"" that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partners to contribute capital to the fund, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In connection with the ""net loss sharing provisions,"" certain of KKR's private equity vehicles allocate a greater share of their investment losses to KKR relative to the amounts contributed by KKR to those vehicles. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by KKR to the limited partners in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2012, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $616.7 million as of December 31, 2012. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, KKR enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. In addition, KKR has provided certain indemnities relating to environmental matters and has provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that KKR has made. KKR's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against KKR that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, KKR expects the risk of material loss to be low. Litigation From time to time, KKR is involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of KKR's business. KKR's business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against it. In August 1999, KKR and certain of its current and former personnel as well as the investment partnerships which made an investment were named as defendants in an action brought in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, or the Alabama State Court, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy in connection with the acquisition of Bruno's, Inc. (""Bruno's""), one of KKR's former portfolio companies, in 1995. The action was removed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In April 2000, the complaint in this action was amended to further allege that KKR and others violated state law by fraudulently misrepresenting the financial condition of Bruno's in an August 1995 subordinated notes offering relating to the acquisition and in Bruno's subsequent periodic financial disclosures. In January 2001, the action was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In 2009, the action was remanded to the Alabama State Court and subsequently consolidated for pretrial purposes with a similar action brought against the underwriters 223 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) of the August 1995 subordinated notes offering, which was pending before the Alabama State Court. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, in an unspecified amount to be proven at trial, for losses they allegedly suffered in connection with their purchase of the subordinated notes. In September 2009, KKR and the other named defendants moved to dismiss the action. In April 2010, the Alabama State Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In August 2011, the Alabama Supreme Court denied KKR's petition seeking permission to appeal certain rulings made by the Alabama State Court when denying in part the motion to dismiss. In October 2011, the plaintiffs' investment adviser filed an amended motion to dismiss a third-party complaint filed by KKR and other defendants asserting a contribution claim against the plaintiffs' investment adviser, which was granted, without prejudice, in October 2012. In December 2011, KKR filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court seeking permission to appeal the Alabama Supreme Court's denial of KKR's petition. In January 2012, the Alabama State Court granted a motion to sever the action from the related action against the underwriters of the subordinated notes. In May 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied KKR's petition for a writ of certiorari. Discovery is ongoing, and trial is scheduled to begin in May 2013. On May 23, 2011, KKR, certain KKR affiliates and the board of directors of Primedia Inc. (a former KKR portfolio company whose directors at that time included certain KKR personnel) were named as defendants, along with others, in two shareholder class action complaints filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware challenging the sale of Primedia in a merger transaction that was completed on July 13, 2011. These actions allege, among other things, that Primedia board members, KKR, and certain KKR affiliates, breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement at an unfair price and failing to disclose all material information about the merger. Plaintiffs also allege that the merger price was unfair in light of the value of certain shareholder derivative claims, which were dismissed on August 8, 2011, based on a stipulation by the parties that the derivative plaintiffs and any other former Primedia shareholders lost standing to prosecute the derivative claims on behalf of Primedia when the Primedia merger was completed. The dismissed shareholder derivative claims included allegations concerning open market purchases of certain shares of Primedia's preferred stock by KKR affiliates in 2002 and allegations concerning Primedia's redemption of certain shares of Primedia's preferred stock in 2004 and 2005, some of which were owned by KKR affiliates. With respect to the pending shareholder class actions challenging the Primedia merger, on June 7, 2011, the Court of Chancery denied a motion to preliminarily enjoin the merger. On July 18, 2011, the Court of Chancery consolidated the two pending shareholder class actions and appointed lead counsel for plaintiffs. On October 7, 2011, defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated shareholder class action. The operative complaint seeks, in relevant part, unspecified monetary damages and rescission of the merger. On December 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which similarly alleges that the Primedia board members, KKR, and certain KKR affiliates breached their respective fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement at an unfair price in light of the value of the dismissed shareholder derivative claims. That amended complaint seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages. On January 31, 2012, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending before the Court of Chancery. Additionally, in May 2011, two shareholder class actions challenging the Primedia merger were filed in Georgia state courts, asserting similar allegations and seeking similar relief as initially sought by 224 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) the Delaware shareholder class actions above. Both Georgia actions have been stayed in favor of the Delaware action. In December 2007, KKR, along with 15 other private equity firms and investment banks, were named as defendants in a purported class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by shareholders in certain public companies acquired by private equity firms since 2003. In August 2008, KKR, along with 16 other private equity firms and investment banks, were named as defendants in a purported consolidated amended class action complaint. The suit alleges that from mid-2003 defendants have violated antitrust laws by allegedly conspiring to rig bids, restrict the supply of private equity financing, fix the prices for target companies at artificially low levels, and divide up an alleged market for private equity services for leveraged buyouts. The amended complaint seeks injunctive relief on behalf of all persons who sold securities to any of the defendants in leveraged buyout transactions and specifically challenges nine transactions. The first stage of discovery concluded on or about April 15, 2010. On August 18, 2010, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to proceed to a second stage of discovery in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court granted a second stage of discovery as to eight additional transactions but denied a second stage of discovery as to any transactions beyond the additional eight specified transactions. On October 7, 2010, the plaintiffs filed under seal a fourth amended complaint that includes new factual allegations concerning the additional eight transactions and the original nine transactions. The fourth amended complaint also includes eight purported sub-classes of plaintiffs seeking unspecified monetary damages and/or restitution with respect to eight of the original nine challenged transactions and new separate claims against two of the original nine challenged transactions. On January 13, 2011, the court granted a motion filed by KKR and certain other defendants to dismiss all claims alleged by a putative damages sub-class in connection with the acquisition of PanAmSat Corp. and separate claims for relief related to the PanAmSat transaction. The second phase of discovery permitted by the court is completed. On July 11, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file a proposed fifth amended complaint that seeks to challenge ten additional transactions in addition to the transactions identified in the previous complaints. Defendants opposed plaintiffs' motion. On September 7, 2011, the court granted plaintiffs' motion in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court granted a third stage of limited discovery as to the ten additional transactions identified in plaintiffs' proposed fifth amended complaint but denied plaintiffs' motion seeking leave to file a proposed fifth amended complaint. On June 14, 2012, following the completion of the third phase of discovery, plaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint which, like their proposed fifth amended complaint, seeks to challenge ten additional transactions in addition to the transactions identified in the previous complaints. On June 22, 2012, defendants filed a motion to dismiss certain claims asserted in the fifth amended complaint. On July 18, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing certain previously released claims against certain defendants. On July 23, 2012, defendants, including KKR, filed motions for summary judgment, which is pending decision before the United States District Court. On March 4, 2011, KKR received a request from the SEC for information relating to the acquisition of Del Monte Foods Company by private equity funds affiliated with KKR and two other private equity firms, which was announced on November 25, 2010 and completed on March 8, 2011. On May 20, 2011 the SEC issued a subpoena to KKR seeking substantially the same documents and information as the March 4, 2011 request for information. On December 16, 2011, the SEC issued another subpoena to KKR seeking documents and information regarding the period prior to the 225 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) announcement of the acquisition of Del Monte Foods Company. KKR is cooperating with the SEC's investigations. In September 2006 and March 2009, KKR received requests for certain documents and other information from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") in connection with the DOJ's investigation of private equity firms to determine whether they have engaged in conduct prohibited by United States antitrust laws. KKR is cooperating with the DOJ's investigation. In January 2011, KKR received a request from the SEC for information regarding KKR's fund investors and clients that the SEC defines as sovereign wealth funds and certain services provided by KKR. On December 19, 2011, the SEC issued a subpoena to KKR seeking additional documents and information involving certain sovereign wealth funds specified by the SEC, and on December 6, 2012 and February 15, 2013, the SEC requested some additional documents and information pursuant to such subpoena regarding the specified sovereign wealth funds. KKR is cooperating with the SEC's investigation. In July 2012, KKR received a subpoena from the New York State Attorney General's Office seeking information and documents concerning the waiver or deferral of management fees with respect to funds where KKR or its affiliate serves or served as such a fund's general partner. KKR is cooperating with this investigation. Moreover, in the ordinary course of business KKR is subject to governmental and regulatory examinations or investigations and also is and can be both the defendant and the plaintiff in numerous actions with respect to acquisitions, bankruptcy, insolvency and other types of proceedings. Such lawsuits may involve claims that adversely affect the value of certain investments owned by KKR's funds. KKR establishes an accrued liability for litigation, regulatory and other matters only when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. No loss contingency is recorded for matters where such losses are either not probable or reasonably estimable (or both) at the time of determination. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, including among others (i) the proceedings are in early stages; (ii) damages sought are unspecified, unsupportable, unexplained or uncertain; (iii) discovery has not been started or is incomplete; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties. Consequently, management is unable to estimate a range of potential loss, if any, related to these matters. For one or more of the matters described above for which a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, we have estimated the aggregate amount of losses attributable to KKR to be approximately $32.5 million. We believe such losses should be, in whole or in part, subject to insurance and/or indemnity, which we believe will reduce any ultimate loss. This estimate is based upon information available as of February 21, 2013 and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. Actual outcomes may vary significantly from this estimate. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings, and some of the matters discussed above seek potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts. As of such date, based on information known by management, management has not 226 Table of Contents KKR & CO. L.P. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted) 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) concluded that the final resolutions of the matters above will have a material effect upon the consolidated financial statements. However, given the potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of investigations and litigations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on our financial results in any particular period. 16. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS KKR has a registered broker-dealer which is subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA""). Additionally, KKR has an entity based in London which is subject to the capital requirements of the U.K. Financial Services Authority, another entity based in Hong Kong which is subject to the capital requirements of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance, an entity based in Japan subject to the Financial Services Authority of Japan, and two entities based in Mumbai which are subject to capital requirements of the Reserve Bank of India (""RBI"") and Securities and Exchange Board of India (""SEBI""). All of these broker dealer entities have continuously operated in excess of their respective minimum regulatory capital requirements. The regulatory capital requirements referred to above may restrict KKR's ability to withdraw capital from its registered broker-dealer entities.

ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are at the reasonable assurance level: (i) effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act; and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. On October 1, 2012, we acquired Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (as discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). The internal control over financial reporting of Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates was excluded from the evaluation of the company's effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 230 Table of Contents On October 1, 2012, we acquired Prisma Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (as discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). We are in the process of evaluating the internal controls of the acquired business. However, as permitted by related SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, we excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired business from management's annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In the aggregate, this business represented approximately 0.6% of our total consolidated assets and approximately 3.0% of our total consolidated fees as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, we are a leading global investment firm with $94.3 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2013 and a 37-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. When our founders started our firm in 1976, they established the principles that guide our business approach today, including a patient and disciplined investment process; the alignment of our interests with those of our fund investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders; and a focus on attracting world class talent. Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 230 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $485 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, equity strategies, hedge fund solutions, capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds. We conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other principal investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. We seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these 107 Table of Contents aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. Business Segments Private Markets Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and source investments in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. Public Markets We operate our credit and hedge funds businesses through the Public Markets segment. Our credit business is managed by KKR Asset Management, LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. KAM advises funds, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts, BDCs and other investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds and (ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments, direct lending investments and long/short credit. In addition, on February 19, 2014, KKR acquired Avoca, a leading European credit investment manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2013. In addition to our credit business, we have a hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies and focuses on providing investment solutions for institutional investors. These strategies are managed by KAM and Prisma Capital Partners LP, or KKR Prisma, an SEC registered investment adviser. This business offers customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge fund-of-fund solutions and a long/short equity strategy. In addition, on January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk. Capital Markets and Principal Activities Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with our global capital markets business. Our capital markets business employs approximately 45 executives and supports our firm, our portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings and providing other types of capital markets services. When we underwrite an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities or indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities or debt with capital markets investors. To allow us to carry out these activities, we are registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Our third party capital markets activities are generally carried out through Merchant Capital Solutions LLC, a joint venture with two other unaffiliated partners and non-bank financial companies, or NBFCs, in India. KKR's principal assets, which include investments in our investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide us with a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing portfolio of businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The majority of our 108 Table of Contents principal assets consist of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR private equity funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such private equity funds, and other assets we acquired in the KPE Transaction, with the remaining holdings consisting of assets held in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies and other opportunistic investments. We believe that the market experience and skills of professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of professionals in our Private Markets and Public Markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this asset base over time. Business Environment As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and elsewhere in the world. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments. While certain economies experienced moderate expansion in 2013, the current global economic environment remains uncertain. Within Europe, there is a divergence between stronger growth in Germany, and weaker or negative growth in other countries. Overall, Europe has experienced negative growth trends as sovereign debt concerns have affected consumer and business behavior which has pushed the region into recession. Fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of European countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, stresses in the European banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area. Through the course of 2013, fiscal restraint, deficit reductions, and central bank support have alleviated some of the stresses and borrowing costs have receded. However, these issues may resurface if there is not continual progress in structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, and other matters. Ongoing austerity and deleveraging in the developed world are likely to persist in the near-term, but at a slower pace. Importantly, periods of deleveraging tend to be accompanied by increased volatility in the global capital markets, which may pose downside risk to the economic outlook. While a number of policy actions have been taken which seek to address the European sovereign debt crisis, if one or more Eurozone members were to leave the Eurozone, the functioning of Europe's single market currency could be undermined which would cause a deeper and more damaging impact on the global economy. Growth in Asian economies is mixed. For example, the rate of real gross domestic product growth in China remains lower compared to the pace of growth in prior years. In addition, the new Chinese leadership has signaled that its reform agenda is more important than growth, and regulatory and structural adjustments could further impair growth. The U.S. economy grew moderately in 2013, but continues to be restrained by various headwinds. For example, while unemployment has declined, the unemployment rate remains elevated and consumer and business spending has been cautious. In the wake of recent fiscal tightening in the U.S., including the temporary U.S. government shutdown, U.S. consumers could further retrench spending, and while central banks around the world adopt quantitative easing, the U.S. dollar could continue to appreciate, which could impact U.S. corporate profitability as well as curtail U.S. growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced a shift in monetary policy by initiating the tapering of quantitative easing. Uncertainty surrounding the pace and timing of tapering could cause interest rates to rise which could affect our investments. In addition, foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and rising U.S. interest rates may negatively impact certain foreign currencies that depend upon foreign capital flows. For example, the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Australian dollar depreciated 17.6%, 11.1% and 14.2% against the U.S. dollar, respectively in 2013. Furthermore, higher interest rates and weaker currencies in some emerging market currencies may increase country default risk. Within credit markets, spreads have tightened significantly while issuance has reached record levels in 2013. If interest rates rise sharply, or growth remains weak, default risk may rise. Moreover, while our Private Markets business invested or committed over 109 Table of Contents $8.5 billion in new transaction activity during 2013 through February 18, 2014, levels of transaction activity are generally volatile, and reduced levels of transaction activity tend to result in a reduced amount of transaction fees and potential future investment gains. In addition to economic conditions, global equity markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as equity prices, which have been and may continue to be volatile, significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. For our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. For other investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings, or IPOs, as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. For example, during the first quarter of 2014, we have been able to complete an IPO for Santander Consumer USA (NYSE: SC) and complete secondary sales of common shares of Kion Group AG (XETRA: KGX), ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (XETRA: PSM) and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI). Notwithstanding the trends described above, global equity markets rose during the year ended December 31, 2013, with the S&P 500 Index up 32.4% and the MSCI World Index up 27.4%. Equity market volatility declined during the year ended December 31, 2013 as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, beginning the year at 18.0 and ending at 13.7 on December 31, 2013. The below-investment grade credit markets trailed the equity markets, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 5.3% and the BoAML HY Master II Index up 7.4% during the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Conditions in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity and other transactions. Similarly, our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness. To the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance and valuations of those portfolio companies and, therefore, our investment returns on our funds. In addition, during economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth, the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt (and thereby extend our investment holding period) may hinder our ability to realize investment gains from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve. Credit markets can also impact valuations. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, as was the case in 2013, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. 110 Table of Contents Our Public Markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit and equity strategies, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and mezzanine debt. As a result, conditions in global credit and equity markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on favorable terms in the future. In addition, our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. As a result, the conditions in global equity and credit markets, as well as transaction activity in our Private Markets segment and to a lesser extent, Public Markets segment, impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment. Finally, conditions in commodity markets impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways, including through the direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. The price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility, which among other things, could be driven by economic, monetary, political or weather related factors. If certain of our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw materials or other inputs, or if consumers defer purchases of or seek substitutes for the products of such portfolio companies, such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which may in turn reduce the valuation of those portfolio companies. However, the results of operations and valuations of certain of our other portfolio companies, for example those involved in the development of oil and natural gas properties, may benefit from an increase or suffer from a decline in commodity prices. In particular, our Private Markets portfolio contains several real asset investments whose values are influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. While near-term natural gas and oil prices rose during the year ended December 31, 2013, long-term pricing of such real assets was by comparison more stable. The valuations of these real asset investments generally increase or decrease with the increase or decrease, respectively, of such long-term commodities prices as well as individual company performance. Furthermore, as we make additional investments in oil and gas companies and assets, the value of our portfolio may become increasingly sensitive to oil and gas prices. Basis of Accounting The consolidated financial statements, referred to hereafter as our ""financial statements,"" include the accounts of KKR's management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest or non-economic variable interest in those entities. In particular, the majority of our consolidated funds consist of funds in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds. With respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. As of December 31, 2013, our Private Markets segment included 21 consolidated investment funds and 17 unconsolidated co-investment vehicles. Our Public Markets segment included 11 consolidated investment vehicles and 53 unconsolidated vehicles. 111 Table of Contents When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Consolidation."" Key Financial Measures Fees Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, and (iv) consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing advisory and other services. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. Fees reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. However, because those management fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors in our funds who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds, net income attributable to KKR is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. For a further discussion of our fee policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition."" Expenses Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. All KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are 112 Table of Contents funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution. With respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR allocates to its principals and other professionals a portion of the carried interest earned as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. For the purpose of the discussion under ""—Consolidated Results of Operations,"" these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation and benefits expense for KKR employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations. However, for the purposes of the discussion under ""—Segment Analysis,"" carry pool allocations are recorded as a component of Investment Income (Loss). General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. General, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors. Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements."" Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. Dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies. 113 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances, principal assets and credit instruments in which our consolidated funds invest. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from debt issued by KKR, credit facilities entered into by KKR, and debt outstanding at our consolidated funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow, which are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of our consolidated funds or management companies. In addition to these interest costs, we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. See ""—Liquidity"". Income Taxes The KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes. Furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such wholly-owned subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management Holdings Corp., and of the KKR Group Partnerships, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. We also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to KKR Management Holdings Corp., as a result of a 2011 recapitalization of KKR Management Holdings Corp. We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships held by KKR Holdings, we expect this activity to continue. 114 Table of Contents Segment Operating and Performance Measures The segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings L.P. and as such represent the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds that KKR manages. Certain of the following financial measures in this report are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. These financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP if available. We caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included within ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Segment Reporting"" and later in this report under ""—Segment Book Value."" Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"") Fee related earnings is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses (other than certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income). This measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments before investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (""Equity Incentive Plan""); (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. Economic Net Income (Loss) (""ENI"") Economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of KKR's businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations, management fee refunds, interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income; less (iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes. 115 Table of Contents Assets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's credit products; (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles; and (v) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds, for only those funds where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by KKR's investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's investment of committed capital. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which KKR is entitled to a carried interest and (ii) capital invested by KKR's investment funds and vehicles. Gross Dollars Invested Gross dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital that has been invested by all of our Public Markets investment vehicles in our private credit non-liquid strategies and is used as a measure of investment activity for our Public Markets in a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into our Public Markets investment of capital across its private credit non-liquid strategies for all the investment vehicles which it manages. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which our Public Markets Segment is entitled to a fee or carried interest and (ii) internal and proprietary capital invested by our Public Markets investment funds and vehicles. 116 Table of Contents Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. It does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in committed dollars invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by KKR investment funds. Syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment and across its investment platform. Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR's investment funds and vehicles to make future investments. Adjusted Units Adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of KKR that is held by KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of KKR as if all outstanding KKR Holdings units had been exchanged for common units of KKR & Co. L.P. Book Value Book value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of our investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as our overall liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of KKR excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders in our consolidated funds. Book value differs from KKR & Co. L.P. partners' capital on a GAAP basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. Cash and Short-Term Investments Cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating KKR's liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's available liquidity. Cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. The impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of approximately $2.2 billion. Excluding approximately $0.9 billion of liquid short-term investments, cash and short-term investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. 117 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of operations of our three business segments in these periods, see ""—Segment Analysis."" The following tables set forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

L.P. $ 691,226 $ 560,836 $ 1,921 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012 Fees Fees were $762.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $194.1 million, compared to fees of $568.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of $79.8 million, an increase in transaction fees of $50.3 million and an increase in incentive fees of $24.8 million. The increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of Prisma as well as new capital raised primarily in our Public Markets segment. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase in the size and number of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended December 31, 2013 in our Private Markets segment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012. Transaction fees vary by 118 Table of Contents investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to an increase in incentive fees received from Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the scheduled payments of such fees, incentive fees can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. Expenses Expenses were $1,767.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $168.3 million, compared to $1,598.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $179.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expenses of $14.3 million. The increase in other general, administrative and other expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees in connection with the growth of our business, the acquisition of Prisma as well as a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund during the year ended December 31, 2013. The net decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, partially offset by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation as a result of the Prisma acquisition, increased headcount and an increase in fees and (iii) higher equity-based compensation relating to additional equity grants under the Equity Incentive Plan. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, essentially flat compared to $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 7,716,772 $ 7,936,155 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 109,310 (64,482 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,826,082 $ 7,871,673 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for private equity investments which illustrates the variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment 119 Table of Contents Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding gains and losses in our private equity portfolio.

(b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value in our private equity investments. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA), ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V., partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BOM: 534816) and China Outfitters Holdings (HK: 1146). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector), Academy Sports and Outdoors (retail sector) and Oriental Brewery (consumer products sector). The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources (energy sector), Toys R Us (retail sector) and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd. (AX: SWM), Far Eastern Horizon Ltd. (HK: 3360) and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. (HK: 1252). Our private portfolio 120 Table of Contents contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH (manufacturing sector), which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation (financial services sector) and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. Dividend Income Dividend income was $695.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $245.4 million, compared to dividend income of $940.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from Capsugel (healthcare sector), $139.7 million from Pets at Home (consumer products sector), $113.9 million from Visma (technology sector), $85.6 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $52.0 million from Santander Consumer USA and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors, $95.0 million from SunGard (technology sector), $78.5 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. Significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income Interest income was $474.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $116.2 million, compared to $358.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase primarily reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense Interest expense was $99.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $30.4 million, compared to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt obligations in connection with our 2043 Senior Notes issued on February 1, 2013. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, principally a decrease in dividends in investment income, an increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in fees, income before taxes was $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.2 billion, compared to income before taxes of $8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $27.3 million, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase primarily reflects a higher level of investment income in vehicles that allow for redemptions by their limited partners. 121 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.3 billion, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above as well as a decrease in KKR Holdings's ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. was $691.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $130.4 million, compared to $560.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in KKR & Co. L.P.'s ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from 36.9% on December 31, 2012 to 41.6% on December 31, 2013. Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $568.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $155.2 million, compared to fees of $723.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transaction fees of $106.1 million and a decrease in monitoring fees of $73.3 million, which were partially offset by a $17.9 million increase in management fees. The decrease in transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of investments completed in our Private Markets segment and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall capital markets transaction activity. In our Private Markets segment, during 2012 there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion as compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion during 2011. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. In our capital markets business, the transaction fees we receive will depend on the amount of capital our funds and other vehicles deploy, the amount of capital this business syndicates and the number of transactions it completes for third party clients. The decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs of HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V. (NYSE: NLSN), and the sale of Seven Media Group (media sector), while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Also contributing to the decrease in monitoring fees was a decrease in expense reimbursements in connection with monitoring of portfolio companies of $16.2 million. The decrease in monitoring fees from termination payments and expense reimbursements was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and an increase in the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase relating to the acquisition of Prisma as well as increases relating to new capital raised primarily in our Public Markets segment. 122 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in compensation and benefits of $0.4 billion due to (i) higher carried interest being allocated to the carry pool for employees during 2012 as compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of investment income and (ii) higher equity-based compensation relating to equity grants under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by (iii) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition. Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains from investment activities were $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $6.9 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by a higher level of net appreciation in our private equity portfolio in the current period when compared to the prior period. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 7,936,155 $ 619,322 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities (64,482 ) 362,536 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 7,871,673 $ 981,858 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio.

The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd. and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH, which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2011 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion in our 2006 Fund and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 78% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V. and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAZZ), partially offset by decreases in Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK: 1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to Oriental Brewery and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector). The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Dividend Income Dividend income was $940.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $715.8 million, compared to dividend income of $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors, $95.0 million from SunGard, $78.5 million from TDC A/S, and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $82.4 million of dividends from Dollar General Corporation, $68.3 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $29.4 million from TDC A/S, $26.2 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. and an aggregate of $18.8 million of dividends from other investments. These types of dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends and may occur in the future; however, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income Interest income was $358.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $36.7 million, compared to $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase 124 Table of Contents primarily reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense Interest expense was $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $3.6 million, compared to $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in financing arrangements that were entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of enhancing returns. Income (Loss) Before Taxes Due to the factors described above, principally increased gains from investment activities, income before taxes was $8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $7.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $30.7 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due primarily to increases in the investment values of vehicles that allow for redemptions by limited partners, and to a lesser extent an increase in capital contributions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $6.5 billion, compared to $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. was $560.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $558.9 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net gains (losses) from investment activities as described above.

The net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $53.7 million and an increase in management fees of $35.6 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $39.3 million. The increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in both the size and number of fee-generating investments completed. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. The increase in management fees is primarily attributable to new capital raised in KKR North America Fund XI and KKR Asian Fund II, partially offset by the KKR 2006 Fund and KKR Asian Fund entering their post-investment periods with a lower management fee. As of December 31, 2013, FPAUM excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and $2.2 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. The inclusion of these amounts in FPAUM in future periods would be accretive to our fees. The investment period of our European Fund III ends on March 31, 2014, which will reduce the fund's fee rate and change the fund's management fee base from committed capital to invested capital. This will result in a decrease in fees earned for European Fund III beginning in the second quarter of 2014. This decrease will not be offset by a successor European private equity fund until such time as the successor fund has its first close and commences its investment period, which will occur after our European Fund III enters its post-investment period. Expenses Expenses were $434.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $46.3 million, compared to expenses of $388.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with the increase in fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense, as well as an increase in headcount. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $158.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $7.3 million, compared to fee related earnings of $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due to the increase in fees partially offset by increase in expenses and fees as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $795.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $111.6 million, compared to investment income of $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by a lower level of management fee refunds. Management fee refunds amounted to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $113.4 million, as compared to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in 127 Table of Contents European Fund III and European Fund II in the year ended 2012 which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds in the prior period. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. (services sector). Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $692.1 million included $1,174.6 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies which were partially offset by $482.5 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. Increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended December 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Bharti Infratel Ltd. and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Toys R Us, Samson Resources, and U.N. RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. 128 Table of Contents The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote off PagesJaunes Group (media sector) (currently known as Solocal Group SA (FRA: QS3)) and our remaining warrants in Eastman Kodak (technology sector) and sold our remaining investment in Seven West Media Ltd. realizing a modest loss. None of these events had a material impact on our net carried interest. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gains of $917.0 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, partially offset by $224.1 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales of investments. Of the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $952.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $120.8 million, compared to economic net income of $831.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in investment income as described above was the primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2012 $ 49,127,600 New Capital Raised 13,613,100 Distributions (9,197,900 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (272,300 ) Foreign Exchange 32,800 Change in Value 7,939,600 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2013 $ 61,242,900 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ AUM for the Private Markets segment was $61.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $12.1 billion, compared to $49.1 billion at December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable 129 Table of Contents to (i) new capital raised of $13.6 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas and (ii) appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $7.9 billion. The increases were partially offset by $9.2 billion in distributions to private equity fund investors comprised of $6.0 billion of realized gains and $3.2 billion of return of original cost. The appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V., partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti Infratel Ltd and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources, Toys R Us and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. As of December 31, 2013, our AUM excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.2 billion in commitments in connection with other infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. Such commitments will not contribute to AUM unless and until we are entitled to receive fees or carried interest in accordance with our definition of AUM. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2012 $ 41,173,000 New Capital Raised 13,200,600 Distributions (3,860,800 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (654,700 ) Foreign Exchange 172,700 Change in Value 125,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2013 $ 50,156,300 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $50.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.0 billion, compared to $41.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised of $13.2 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II which commenced its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas, which were partially offset by distributions of $3.9 billion to private equity fund investors and a reduction of $0.7 billion reflecting the impact of certain funds entering the post-investment period. 130 Table of Contents Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.8 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012. In the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 70 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $17.0 billion compared to 28 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2013, our Private Markets Segment had $20.1 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $539.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $76.3 million, compared to fees of $615.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross transaction fees of $70.2 million and a decrease in gross monitoring fees of $47.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in fee credits of $47.6 million. The decrease in gross transaction fees was primarily the result of a decrease in the number and size of fee-generating investments completed. In the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a combined transaction value of $24.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs of HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V., and the sale of Seven Media Group, while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. This decrease in monitoring fees from termination payments was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. Expenses Expenses were $388.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $0.7 million, compared to expenses of $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in other operating expenses related to a lower level of broken deal expenses, reflecting reduced transaction activity, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with increased headcount. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $75.6 million, compared to fee related earnings of $226.6 million for 131 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in fees as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $545.4 million, compared to investment income of $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was driven primarily by a higher level of net carried interest in our private equity funds. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, Legrand Holdings S.A. and HCA, Inc. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Hilcorp Resources, LLC (energy sector), Legrand Holdings S.A. and Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO).

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gains of $917.0 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, partially offset by $224.1 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales of investments. Of the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the 132 Table of Contents investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net unrealized losses of $70.6 million included $247.9 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial sales or write-offs which were partially offset by $177.3 million of net unrealized gains reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses resulted primarily from the partial sales of Avago Technologies Limited, Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we wrote-off Capmark Financial Group, Inc. Of the $177.3 million of net increases in value, 80.3% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses on HCA, Inc., Sealy Corporation and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Oriental Brewery and Intelligence Ltd. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses on Biomet, Inc. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. reflecting decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in the value of market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Management fee refunds amounted to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $126.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in European Fund III and European Fund II, which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income (loss) in our Private Markets segment was $831.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $468.9 million, compared to an economic net income of $362.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income.

The increase was primarily attributable to appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $8.5 billion and new capital raised of $7.4 billion related principally to North America Fund XI. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our private equity portfolio of $9.0 billion, comprised of $6.1 billion of realized gains and $2.9 billion of return of original cost, as well as a reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $1.3 billion as a result of the 2006 Fund entering its post-investment period. The change in value in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd, Far Eastern Horizon Ltd and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH, which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012: ($ in thousands) December 31, 2011 $ 37,869,700 New Capital Raised 7,451,700 Distributions (1,089,400 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (3,205,400 ) Foreign Exchange 99,600 Change in Value 46,800 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2012 $ 41,173,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $41.2 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $3.3 billion, compared to $37.9 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to new capital raised of $7.5 billion relating primarily to North America Fund XI commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees. The increases were partially offset by the reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $3.2 billion as a result of the fund entering its post-investment period during which it earns management fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital at a lower rate as well as distributions of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $4.0 billion relating to KKR Asian Fund II, $1.1 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.5 billion in connection with other infrastructure, energy and private equity funds and co-investment vehicles. 134 Table of Contents Committed Dollars Invested Committed dollars invested were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $2.0 billion, compared to committed dollars invested of $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to a decrease in both the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. In the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 28 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $7.3 billion compared to 38 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $26.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $100.9 million and an increase in incentive fees of $28.5 million. The increase in management fees is due primarily to a full year of results for Prisma being reflected in 2013, the impact of our investment in Nephila, which was made during 2013 and new capital raised. The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to (i) an increase in incentive fees received from Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, (ii) incentive fees relating to our investment in Nephila and (iii) incentive fees from our KKR Equity Strategies platform. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the scheduled payments of such fees, incentive fees can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. On December 16, 2013, we, certain of our affiliates and KFN entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR. Upon completion of this merger (which is subject to various conditions, including, among others things, obtaining the requisite approval of KFN's shareholders), KKR would no longer recognize management fees or incentive fees from KFN. Such management fees and incentive fees amounted to $40.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2013. This reduction in fees may be offset in whole or in part, by investment income that is earned from KFN's business. Expenses Expenses were $133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $58.8 million, compared to expenses of $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase across all expense categories was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, (ii) a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund and (iii) to a lesser extent an increase in operating expenses reflecting the continued growth of our Public Markets business. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $155.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $74.9 million, compared to fee related earnings of $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was attributable to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses, in each case as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $14.0 million compared to investment income of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from a larger increase in 137 Table of Contents the net asset values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior period. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income was $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $88.5 million, compared to economic net income of $102.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is attributable to the increase in both fee related earnings as well as investment income, partially offset by higher expenses as described above.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $20.2 million and incentive fees of $9.7 million.

Transaction fees increased primarily due to an increase in number of capital markets transactions in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 128 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2013 of which 16 represented equity offerings and 112 represented debt offerings, as compared to 102 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 88 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses were $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.8 million, compared to expenses of $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was largely due to an increase in compensation and benefits related to higher fees as well as increased headcount in our capital markets business in connection with the growth of this segment. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $10.4 million, compared to fee related earnings of $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in expenses, in each case as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $956.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $154.1 million, compared to investment income of $1,110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The following table reflects the components of investment income for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 ($ in thousands) Net Realized Gains (Losses) $ 635,633 $ 715,930 Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 299,249 243,727 Dividend Income 45,960 143,297 Interest Income 50,425 45,663 Interest Expense (65,662 ) (38,114 ) Other Operating Income and Expenses(a) (9,217 ) — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Investment Income (Loss) $ 956,388 $ 1,110,503 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)Represents certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income that is not included in ""Compensation and benefits"" and ""Other operating expenses"" above. 143 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised of $705.9 million of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Intelligence, Ltd. These realized gains were partially offset by $70.3 million of realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of PagesJaunes Group. Realized investment losses from principal investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Alliance Boots GmbH, partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains on the sale of Dollar General Corporation, HCA Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V. For further discussion of private equity valuation changes, refer to ""—Private Markets Segment."" For the year ended December 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised of $818.6 million of realized gains primarily from the sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were the partial sales of Dollar General, Alliance Boots GmbH and HCA, Inc. These realized gains were partially offset by $102.7 million of realized losses primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH, and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events. Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income was $1,051.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $144.5 million, compared to economic net income of $1,196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital was $1,112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $568.3 million compared to syndicated capital of $543.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the number and size of syndication transactions when compared to year ended December 31, 2012. Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011 Fees Fees were $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $41.3 million, compared to fees of $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. While we completed a greater number of capital markets transactions in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year, transaction fees decreased primarily due to a lower level of syndicated capital as equity syndication transaction sizes were significantly higher for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 102 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 88 represented debt offerings, as compared to 72 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 57 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, 144 Table of Contents and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Expenses Expenses were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $1.3 million, compared to expenses of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense relating primarily to increased headcount which was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses reflecting a lower level of professional fees. Fee Related Earnings Fee related earnings were $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $42.6 million, compared to fee related earnings of $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily related to the decrease in fees as described above. Investment Income (Loss) Investment income was $1,110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $907.7 million, compared to investment income of $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

These realized gains were partially offset by $102.7 million of realized losses primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net realized gains were comprised of $345.1 million of realized gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most significant of which were Dollar General Corporation, HCA, Inc., Avago Technologies Limited, and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, partially offset by $193.4 million of realized losses primarily from the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. The net unrealized gains were comprised of unrealized gains relating to the reversals of previously recognized unrealized losses related primarily to the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. and net unrealized gains reflecting increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Dollar General Corporation and The Nielsen Company B.V. These net unrealized gains were offset by the reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with partial sales of private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation. 145 Table of Contents Economic Net Income (Loss) Economic net income was $1,196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $866.0 million, compared to economic net income of $330.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income. Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital was $543.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,882.8 million compared to syndicated capital of $2,426.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease is primarily due to a lower level of private equity syndication transaction sizes when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, as discussed under ""—Fees"" above.

Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, including the sale of investments and other principal assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds, (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions; (v) underwriting commitments within our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our fund investors and unitholders; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $2.2 billion. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, capital markets transactions and other investment products; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) realizations on and sales of investments and other principal assets; and (iv) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our common units described below. With respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2013, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. As of December 31, 2013, netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds, the most significant of which were our domestic Millennium Fund partnership and domestic 2006 Fund partnership, which had netting holes of approximately $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The domestic Millennium Fund partnership is not in position to pay cash carry. However, subsequent to December 31, 2013, we exited a portion of our investment in Santander Consumer USA. Pro forma for this event, the netting hole in our domestic 2006 Fund partnership was reduced to zero, and consequently, this fund is in position to pay cash carry upon a profitable realization event. However, in 148 Table of Contents accordance with the criteria set forth above, funds currently in position to pay cash carry may develop netting holes in the future and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. As of December 31, 2013, no private equity funds, other than the domestic Millennium Fund partnership and domestic 2006 Fund partnership had a netting hole greater than $50 million. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these sources of funding. Revolving Credit Agreements For the year ended December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings made, and as of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under either of the revolving credit agreements described below, except for a letter of credit under the Corporate Credit Agreement described further below. We may, however, utilize these facilities prospectively in the normal course of our operations. •On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement""). The general partners of our private equity funds are guarantors under this agreement. The Corporate Credit Agreement originally provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. On February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit facility was reduced from $1.0 billion to $700 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the issuer of the 2020 Senior Notes (discussed below) became guarantors of the Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of our private equity funds. On June 3, 2011, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50 million. This commitment increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750 million. On June 22, 2012, KKR requested the issuance of a letter of credit in the amount of $14.5 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is an unaffiliated third party. The letter of credit was issued on July 2, 2012 and initially set to expire on July 3, 2013. On August 20, 2012, the letter of credit in connection with this fee-generating transaction was increased to $20.0 million and the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2013. On July 23, 2013, the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2014. A $5.0 million sublimit for letters of credit remains available under the Corporate Credit Agreement. •On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement"") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. On March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition to extending the terms, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a reduction of the cost of funding on amounts drawn and a reduced commitment fee. Borrowings under this facility may only be used for our capital markets business. Senior Notes •On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co. LLC, a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp., issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes (the 149 Table of Contents ""2020 Senior Notes""), which were issued at a price of 99.584%.

The 2020 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The 2020 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, accruing from September 29, 2010. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 29 and September 29 of each year. The indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the 2020 Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on the issuer's and the guarantors' ability to, subject to exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indenture, as supplemented, also provides for events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2020 Senior Notes may declare the 2020 Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Senior Notes automatically becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the 2020 Senior Notes may be redeemed at the issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the 2020 Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the 2020 Senior Notes are subject to repurchase by the issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. •On February 1, 2013, KKR Group Finance Co. II LLC, a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp., issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes (the ""2043 Senior Notes""), which were issued at a price of 98.856%. The 2043 Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer and will mature on February 1, 2043, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 2043 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The 2043 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, accruing from February 1, 2013. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the 2043 Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on the issuer's and the guarantors' ability to, subject to exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indenture, as supplemented, also provides for events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2043 Senior Notes may declare the 2043 Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the 2043 Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2043 Senior Notes automatically becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the 2043 Senior Notes may be redeemed at the issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the 2043 Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the 2043 Senior Notes are subject to repurchase by the issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the 150 Table of Contents aggregate principal amount of the 2043 Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2043 Senior Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Common Units •On April 12, 2013, KKR & Co. L.P. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale by us from time to time of up to 2,500,000 common units of KKR & Co. L.P. to generate cash proceeds (a) up to (1) the amount of withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, and (2) the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan that are settled in cash instead of common units; and (b) to the extent the net proceeds from the sale of common units exceeds the amounts due under clause (a), for general corporate purposes. The administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan is expected to reduce the maximum number of common units eligible to be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan by the number of common units issued and sold pursuant to the registration statement unless such reduction is already provided for with respect to such awards under the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statement effective on May 6, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, 844,073 common units have been issued and sold under the registration statement and are included in our basic common units outstanding as of December 31, 2013. Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: (i) continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; (ii) service debt obligations that may give rise to future cash payments; (iii) fund cash operating expenses; (iv) pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings as described below; (v) make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy; (vi) underwrite commitments within our capital markets business and (vii) acquire additional principal assets, including the acquisition of other investment advisory and capital markets businesses. We may also require cash to fund contingent obligations including those under clawback, net loss sharing arrangements, contingent purchase price payments in connection with our acquisitions of or investments in equity stakes in other businesses or obligations in connection with the defense, prosecution, or settlement of legal claims. See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Capital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. In addition, we are responsible for certain limited partner interests in some of our private 151 Table of Contents equity funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2013: Uncalled Commitments ($ in thousands) Private Markets North America Fund XI $ 324,800 Energy Income and Growth Fund 227,500 Real Estate Partners Americas 123,200 European Fund III 121,500 Asian Fund II 72,400 2006 Fund 61,700 Infrastructure 19,900 Natural Resources 11,100 China Growth Fund 6,400 Asian Fund 3,700 E2 Investors (Annex Fund) 900 Co-Investment Vehicles 39,200 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Private Markets Commitments 1,012,300 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Public Markets Special Situations Vehicles 125,900 Mezzanine Fund 21,200 Direct Lending Vehicles 12,600 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Public Markets Commitments 159,700 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Uncalled Commitments $ 1,172,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As of December 31, 2013, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $1,172.0 million to its active private equity and other investment vehicles, (ii) $83.7 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business and (iii) $161.0 million relating to Merchant Capital Solutions as described below and certain other investment commitments. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding. In addition to the commitments described above, KKR has earmarked approximately $430 million to fund, acquire and develop new strategies, products and initiatives including energy, real estate, alternative credit and other strategies. The amounts earmarked to fund and develop new strategies, products and initiatives may be revised or terminated by KKR in its discretion from time to time. Prisma Capital Partners On October 1, 2012, KKR acquired all of the equity interests of Prisma. KKR may become obligated to make future purchase price payments in the years 2014 and 2017 based on whether the Prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such years. KKR has the right in its sole discretion to pay a portion of such future purchase price payments, if any, in KKR & Co. L.P. common units rather than in cash. Merchant Capital Solutions Merchant Capital Solutions LLC (""MCS"", formerly known as ""MerchCap Solutions LLC"") is a joint venture partnership with Stone Point Capital (""Stone Point"") and CPPIB Credit Investments, Inc. (""CPPIB""). MCS seeks to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as make certain principal investments to support client needs. KKR and Stone Point each committed $150 million of equity and CPPIB committed an additional $50 million to MCS to support its business. KKR expects that certain capital markets activities for third parties (other than KKR and its Portfolio Companies) will be principally conducted by MCS. 152 Table of Contents Acquisition of Avoca Capital On February 19, 2014, KKR closed its previously announced acquisition of Avoca Capital and its affiliates (""Avoca""), a European credit investment manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2013. The purchase price was payable by KKR at the closing in cash, and/or securities representing the right to receive up to approximately 5.0 million KKR & Co. L.P. common units. Acquisition of KFN On December 16, 2013, KKR, affiliates of KKR and KFN, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR Fund Holdings (the ""Merger""), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. KFN is managed by KKR Financial Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of KKR, pursuant to a management agreement. Completion of the merger is subject to various conditions. At the effective time of the merger, each common share of KFN issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any common shares held by KKR Fund Holdings or any of its subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.51 KKR common units together with cash in lieu of fractional units. Tax Receivable Agreement We and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to executives who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR common units as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. These payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from 153 Table of Contents those received by current and former holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings and our current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $4.7 million, $2.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31, 2013, $1.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized. Distributions In April 2013, we amended our distribution policy to provide for the quarterly distribution of a percentage of net realized principal investment income as described below. The distribution of net realized principal investment income replaces the annual, additional distribution that was historically announced in connection with fourth quarter earnings. This additional distribution was intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by us, and as a result of the change in distribution policy, we expect that such additional distributions will no longer be made, although the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P. may decide otherwise from time to time. We intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business and 40% of the net cash income from our realized principal investments, in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations. For purposes of our distribution policy, distributions are expected to consist of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool and (iii) a percentage of net realized principal investment income. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) non-controlling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above. The declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P., which may change the distribution policy at any time, and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment of their tax liabilities as limited partners of KKR & Co. L.P. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships (the holding companies of the KKR business), KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships. 154 Table of Contents The following table presents our distribution calculation for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011as described above. Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Cash Revenues Fees $ 1,028,330 $ 823,895 $ 911,668 Realized cash carry 690,027 475,707 336,858 Net realized principal investment income 657,139 866,776 186,288 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Cash Revenue 2,375,496 2,166,378 1,434,814 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash Expenses Realized cash carry allocated to carry pool 276,011 190,283 134,743 Compensation and benefits 343,772 272,811 257,951 Occupancy and related charges 56,327 55,068 51,009 Other operating expenses 215,883 176,205 185,555 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Cash Expenses 891,993 694,367 629,258 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash income (loss) before noncontrolling interests and local taxes 1,483,503 1,472,011 805,556 Less: local income taxes (21,238 ) (15,572 ) (16,291 ) Less: noncontrolling interests (6,387 ) (7,043 ) (6,671 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Distributable Earnings 1,455,878 1,449,396 782,594 Less: estimated current corporate income taxes (98,814 ) (66,733 ) (174,929 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distributable Earnings, net of taxes 1,357,064 1,382,663 607,665 Less: Undistributed net realized principal investment income (394,285 ) (544,395 ) (97,449 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distributed Earnings $ 962,779 $ 838,268 $ 510,216 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distribution per KKR & Co.

This is a term to describe a portion of KKR's quarterly distribution. Realized investment losses from principal investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized principal investment income as described above in (i) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. 155 Table of Contents Total Distributable Earnings Total distributable earnings is the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool and (iii) net realized principal investment income; less (i) applicable local income taxes, if any, and (ii) noncontrolling interests. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses), and also assess amounts available for distribution to KKR unitholders. However, total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under KKR's current distribution policy. Total distributable earnings were $1,455.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, compared to $1,449.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry of $214.3 million and an increase in fees of $204.4 million, largely offset by a decrease in net realized principal investment income of $209.6 million, an increase in realized cash carry allocated to carry pool of $85.7 million and increase in compensation and benefits of $71.0 million. Total distributable earnings were $1,449.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $666.8 million, compared to $782.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net realized principal investment income of $680.5 million and an increase in realized cash carry of $138.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in fees of $87.8 million and an increase in realized cash carry allocated to carry pool of $55.5 million. Other Liquidity Needs We may also be required to fund various underwriting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments. We generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own account. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2013 on an unconsolidated basis: Payments due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 1,172.0 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,172.0 Debt payment obligations(2) — — — 1,000.0 1,000.0 Interest obligations on debt(3) 59.4 118.8 118.8 739.7 1,036.7 Underwriting commitments(4) 38.8 — — — 38.8 Lending commitments(5) 44.9 — — — 44.9 Other commitments(6) 161.0 — — — 161.0 Lease obligations 46.5 91.6 76.3 92.6 307.0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 1,522.6 $ 210.4 $ 195.1 $ 1,832.3 $ 3,760.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which 156 Table of Contents our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs."" (2)Represents the 2020 Senior Notes and 2043 Senior Notes, which are presented gross of unamortized discount. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2013, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. These commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated. (5)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. (6)Represents our commitment to MCS and certain other investment commitments. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Merchant Capital Solutions."" The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement, because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2013, a payable of $89.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $7.6 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement."" The commitment table above excludes contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2013, the recorded amounts of these contingent consideration obligations were approximately $156.7 million. The commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts to be paid, if any, are not presently known. See the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. In addition, certain of our consolidated funds have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. However, based on prior experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be low. The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds and vehicles relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry 157 Table of Contents distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds. Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the KPE Transaction, as of December 31, 2013, no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2013 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback obligation would have been $1,350.7 million. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Certain private equity funds that were contributed to us in the KPE Transaction in 2009 also include a ""net loss sharing provision."" Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2013, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $496.4 million as of December 31, 2013. Prior to the KPE Transaction in 2009, certain of our principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that our principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Using valuations as of December 31, 2013, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by our principals. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and our principals who participate in the carry pool. Unlike the clawback obligation, we will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify our principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information 158 Table of Contents relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2013. This table differs from the table presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds.

(2)Amounts include the 2020 Senior Notes and 2043 Senior Notes, gross of unamortized discount as well as financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds. Certain of our consolidated fund investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements in connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the fund. Such financing arrangements consist of $915.5 million of financing provided through a term loan and revolving credit facilities. These financing arrangements have been entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the fund and are not direct obligations of the general partners of our private equity funds or our management companies.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular, include our consolidated funds notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of our consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $2.6 billion, $6.2 billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments by our funds of $1.4 billion, $5.1 billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $3.9 billion, $5.2 billion and $3.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $3.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $(2.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Certain KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $15.5 million, $(220.9) million and $(47.6) million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, computer hardware and leasehold improvements of $14.4 million, $37.0 million and $18.2 million as well as a (decrease) increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents that primarily funds collateral requirements of $(29.9) million, $(2.9) million and $29.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively as well as cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $(186.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2012. 160 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2.5) billion, $(5.6) billion and $0.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests, of $(2.8) billion, $(4.9) billion and $0.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; (ii) net proceeds received net of repayment of debt obligations of $0.8 billion, $(0.4) billion and $0.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and (iii) distributions to our partners of $(0.4) billion, $(0.2) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation Our policy is to consolidate (i) those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including those private equity, credit, and other investment funds and their respective consolidated funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities (""VIEs"") for which we are considered the primary beneficiary. With respect to the consolidated KKR funds, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. The consolidated KKR funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, those investments are accounted for as investments and carried at fair value as described below. The KKR funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third party investors in our funds, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, our attributable share of the net income from those 161 Table of Contents funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to us or our partners' capital. Noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than us. Investments Investments consist primarily of private equity, real assets, credit, equity method and other investments. Investments are carried at their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Further disclosure on investments is presented in Note 4 ""Investments"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The following describes the types of securities held within each investment class. Private Equity—Consists primarily of equity investments in operating companies. Real Assets—Consists primarily of investments in (i) oil and natural gas properties (""energy""), (ii) infrastructure assets, and (iii) residential and commercial real estate assets and businesses (""real estate""). Credit—Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans), distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in collateralized loan obligations. Equity Method—Consists primarily of investments in unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles are reported at fair value, the carrying value of our equity method investments representing KKR's interests in unconsolidated funds approximates fair value. Other—Consists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity, real assets, credit or equity method investments. Fair Value Measurements Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated funds. Our funds and vehicles are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. We have retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by our funds and vehicles are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle, we have elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on 162 Table of Contents an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and vehicles. The carrying amounts of Other Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition (excluding Fixed Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. These items are presented in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report, specifically, information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets is presented in Note 14 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"" and information on contingent consideration is presented in Note 13 ""Acquisitions."" Our debt obligations, except for our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value. Further information on our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes are presented in Note 8 ""Debt Obligations."" The fair value for our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes were derived using Level II inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. See Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements"" for further information on our valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows: Level I Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt and securities sold short. We classified 17.6% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2013. Level II Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 8.4% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2013. Level III Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. We classified 74.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2013. The valuation of our Level III investments at 163 Table of Contents December 31, 2013 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset. A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels I, II, and III, which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period. Investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. We do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. Level II Valuation Methodologies Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of securities indexed to publicly-listed securities and credit and other investments. Credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. Our policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value. For securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security. 164 Table of Contents Level III Valuation Methodologies Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level III consist primarily of the following: Private Equity Investments: We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used in both methodologies. For valuations determined for periods other than at year end, various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period. Also, as discussed in greater detail under ""—Business Environment,"" a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. In certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. Upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies. When determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, we consider, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. Across the Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 85% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of the Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2013, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology for our Level III private equity investments were 51% and 49%, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we believe that the approach of using both the market multiples methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology resulted in valuations of our aggregate Level III private equity portfolio that were only marginally higher than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and that were only marginally lower than if only the market comparables methodology had been used. When determining the illiquidity discount to be applied, we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum 5% discount to all private equity investments. We then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. These factors generally include (i) whether we are unable to sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. These factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the 165 Table of Contents time horizon over which an investment may be monetized. Depending on the applicability of these factors, we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5% minimum, and during the time we hold the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time, based on changes to these factors. The amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment. Accordingly, the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations. Real Assets Investments: For energy and infrastructure investments, we generally utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. For real estate investments, we generally utilize a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in these methodologies include an unlevered discount rate and terminal capitalization rate. The valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs. Certain investments in real estate and energy generally do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. Credit Investments: Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of values determined by an independent valuation firm. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers. Other Investments: We generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements."" We utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies. Level III Valuation Process The valuation process involved for Level III measurements for private equity, real assets, credit, and other investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. We have a Private Markets valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit and other investments. The Private Markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of real estate investments. Each of the Private Markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued. The valuation teams for energy, infrastructure and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing our quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For Private Markets investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial 166 Table of Contents and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations for all Level III investments in Private Markets, except for certain investments other than our private equity investments. For most investments classified as Level III in Public Markets, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by us to provide third party valuations, or ranges of valuations from which our investment professionals select a preliminary valuation, or a third party firm is generally engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations. All preliminary valuations in Private Markets and Public Markets are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to a single committee consisting of senior principals involved in various aspects of the our business. When these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors. As of December 31, 2013, upon completion by an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR, of Private Markets investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on certain Level III credit investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. As described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time. Changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under ""—Key Financial Measures—Investment Income (Loss)—Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities."" Based on the investments of our private equity funds as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments. As of December 31, 2013, private equity investments which represented greater than 5% of consolidated investments consisted of Alliance Boots GmbH valued at $4.6 billion. On a segment basis, as of December 31, 2013, investments which represented greater than 5% of total reportable segments investments consisted of Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA Inc. and First Data Corporation, valued at $640.7 million, $287.3 million and $265.1 million, respectively. 167 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles, and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies and (iv) consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing advisory and other services. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. Certain of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31, 2013, there is no carried interest subject to management fee refunds, which may reduce carried interest in future periods. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements. Recognition of Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. Due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements. Recognition of Carried Interest in Statement of Operations Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and 168 Table of Contents correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. Clawback Provision The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a carry-paying fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance hurdle. Prior to the KPE Transaction, certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to KKR had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that KKR principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to KKR and KKR's principals who participate in the carry pool. Net Loss Sharing Provision Certain private equity funds that were contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction also include a ""net loss sharing provision."" Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by KKR to fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any 169 Table of Contents carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Unlike the clawback obligation, KKR will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify KKR's principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-11, ""Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities"" (""ASU 2011-11""), which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. ASU 2011-11 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013 and was applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on KKR's condensed consolidated financial statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, ""Intangibles—Goodwill and Other,"" which provides the option to perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, an entity is required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance. The guidance was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is intended to simplify the impairment testing, did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. Disclosures About Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, ""Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""AOCI""),"" which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including: (i) changes in AOCI balances by component and (ii) significant items reclassified out of AOCI. ASU 2013-02 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, did not have a material impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. AOCI is comprised of only one component, foreign currency translation adjustments, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no items reclassified out of AOCI. See KKR's condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and changes in equity. Foreign Currency Matters In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, ""Foreign Currency Matters,"" which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment (""CTA"") related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a (i) sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, (ii) loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity, and (iii) step acquisition for a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's condensed consolidated financial statements. 170 Table of Contents Amendments to Investment Company Scope, Measurement, and Disclosures In June 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, ""Financial Services—Investment Companies Topic 946"" (""ASU 2013-08"") which amends the scope, measurement, and disclosure requirements for investment companies. ASU 2013-08 (i) amends the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, (ii) requires an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value rather than using the equity method of accounting, and (iii) introduces new disclosures. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014. Earlier application is prohibited. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial results and consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest and net gains from investment activities. We have an increased exposure to market risks as a result of our principal assets. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below. The firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks. Management of Market Risk When we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our two Co-Chief Executive Officers, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, must approve the transaction before it may be made. In addition, this committee supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and other strategies for the composition of our balance sheet. Certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions, after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above. With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee, and then a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal 171 Table of Contents and regulatory issues, financial data and other information. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis. Management of General Business Risk KKR has a risk committee comprised of senior employees from across our business segments and across business operations, and includes our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our General Counsel. The risk committee monitors and evaluates KKR's general business risks. The Chief Administrative Officer, who also serves as the chairman of the risk committee, regularly reports to our Co-Chief Executive Officers and quarterly to the Audit Committee, which is the chief committee that monitors risk on behalf of the Board of Directors. In addition, in 2013 we established a position dedicated to evaluating and monitoring market risk and coordinating such efforts across our businesses. KKR's global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including conflicts relating to specific transactions and circumstances as well as those implicit in the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses and monitors compliance matters. Our Chief Administrative Officer and our General Counsel are members of this committee. KKR's management committee is responsible for evaluating certain matters affecting the business of KKR. It consists of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our General Counsel and other senior principals across our business segments and across business operations, and is chaired by our Chief Administrative Officer. The management committee is responsible for approving the valuation of our Level III investments in Private and Public Markets. Market Risk The majority of our investments are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on the investments held as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds. Based on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income 172 Table of Contents attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. in 2014 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors: Year Ended December 31, 2013 Management fees Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool Allocation Net Gains/ (Losses) From Investment Activities Excluding Carried Interest ($ in thousands) 10% Decline in Fair Value of Investments(1) $ 8,092 (2) $ 187,668 (3) $ 226,992 (3) (1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at December 31st of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees were earned. (2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees. (3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. Our management fees in our Private Markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Segments—Private Markets."" Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not affect the amount of fees we may charge in these types of funds. In the case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund, vehicle, or specialty finance company, for that particular period, although certain funds in our Public Markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested. To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the approximate percentage of our fund management fees based on the NAV of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts, are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2013 Fund Management Fees Based on NAV of the Applicable Funds 26 % Securities Market Risk Our investment funds and principal assets hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our investments are comprised primarily of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these 173 Table of Contents investments may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds and principal assets hold investments in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are denominated. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated. Because most of the capital commitments to our funds and KKR's capital are denominated in U.S. dollars, our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros, British pounds and Korean won), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds. We estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as of December 31, 2013 would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. in 2014 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors: Year Ended December 31, 2013 Management fees Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool Allocation Net Gains/ (Losses) From Investment Activities Excluding Carried Interest ($ in thousands) 10% Decline in Foreign Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar(1) $ 3,447 (2) $ 24,106 (3) $ 44,957 (3) (1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would only marginally impact our ability to earn incentive fees since the majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in U.S. dollars. (2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees. (3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise 174 Table of Contents perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. Interest Rate Risk We and our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing arrangements structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates, and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that we would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. Based on our debt obligations payable at December 31, 2013 (inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds), we estimate that interest expense relating to instruments bearing variable rates would increase on an annual basis by $9.2 million in the event interest rates were to increase by a hypothetical 100 basis points. Based on outstanding debt obligations at December 31, 2013, the estimated impact on interest expense is solely related to the debt obligations of our consolidated funds, a substantial portion of which is attributable to noncontrolling interests. 175 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:24:17.881616

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview We are a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds. We aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. We invest our own capital alongside the capital we manage for fund investors and bring debt and equity investment opportunities to others through our capital markets business. Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 250 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $505 billion. We have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations (""CLOs""), capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. These efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds. We conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. We have also used our balance sheet as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The majority of our balance sheet consists of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR investment funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of KKR private equity funds and interests in CLOs, corporate loans, debt securities and energy and real estate assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of KKR Financial Holdings on April 30, 2014. Our balance sheet also holds other assets used in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies. As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other balance sheet investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the 111 Table of Contents sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. These teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration and not subject to redemption. With over 75% of our fee paying assets under management not subject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception, we have significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. We believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. Business Segments Private Markets Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and sponsor a group of funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2014, the segment had $61.5 billion of AUM and FPAUM of $47.3 billion, consisting of $38.3 billion in private equity and $9.0 billion in real assets (including infrastructure, energy and real estate) and other strategies. Prior to 2010, FPAUM in the Private Markets segment consisted entirely of private equity funds. Public Markets We operate and report our combined credit and hedge funds businesses through the Public Markets segment. Our credit business advises funds, CLOs, separately managed accounts, and investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, including a business development company or BDC, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or UCITS, and alternative investments funds or AIFs, which invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans, high yield bonds and opportunistic credit, and (ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, direct lending investments, special situations investments and long/short credit investment strategies. The funds, accounts, registered investment companies and CLOs in our leveraged credit and alternative credit strategies are managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC (formerly known as KKR Asset Management LLC), which is a SEC-registered investment adviser, KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland), regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, and KKR Credit Advisors (UK), regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA. KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) and KKR Credit Advisors (UK) (formerly known collectively as Avoca Capital) were acquired by KKR on February 19, 2014. Our Public Markets segment also includes our hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies including customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge fund-of-fund solutions and acquiring stakes in or seeding hedge fund managers. The funds and accounts in our hedge fund business are managed by Prisma Capital Partners LP, an SEC-registered investment adviser. In our hedge funds stakes and seeding business, we have a 24.9% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd., or Nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk, and a 24.9% interest in BlackGold Capital Management L.P., or BlackGold, a credit-oriented investment manager focused on investing in energy and hard asset investments. 112 Table of Contents We intend to continue to grow the Public Markets business by leveraging our global investment platform, experienced investment professionals and the ability to adapt our investment strategies to different market conditions to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at various levels of the capital structure and across market cycles. As of December 31, 2014, this segment had $37.1 billion of AUM, comprised of $17.5 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $8.7 billion of assets managed in our alternative credit strategies $10.2 billion of assets managed in our hedge fund solutions strategies and $0.7 billion of assets managed in other strategies. Our alternative credit investments include $1.8 billion of assets managed in our mezzanine strategy, $2.4 billion of assets managed in our direct lending strategy, $3.5 billion of assets managed in our special situations strategies and $1.0 billion of assets managed in our long/short credit strategy. The following chart presents the growth in the AUM of our Public Markets segment from the commencement of its operations in August 2004 through December 31, 2014. Capital Markets and Other Our Capital Markets and Other segment is comprised primarily of our global capital markets business. Our capital markets business supports our firm, our private equity portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings and providing other types of capital markets services. When we underwrite an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities or indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities or debt with capital markets investors. KKR Capital Markets LLC is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a FINRA member, and we are also registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Our third party capital markets activities are generally carried out through Merchant Capital Solutions LLC, a joint venture with two other unaffiliated partners, and non-bank financial companies, or NBFCs, in India. Business Environment Market Conditions As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in North and South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and elsewhere in the world. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments. In terms of economic conditions, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP in the U.S. increased 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.4% for the full year ended December 31, 2014. As of January 2015, The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, estimates that the U.S. economy will expand by 3.6% in 2015. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 6.2% as of December 31, 2014. In the Euro Area, real GDP increased 0.34% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 0.9% for full year ended December 31, 2014 according to Eurostat. The Euro Area unemployment rate remains elevated at 11.6% as of October 7, 2014, despite recent signs of improvement according to the IMF. As of January 2015, the IMF estimates that the Euro Area will expand by 1.2% in 2015. According to the China Bureau of National Statistics, real GDP in China increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7.4% for the full year ended December 31, 2014. As of January 2015, the IMF estimates that China's economy will expand by 6.8% in 2015. In China, the unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.1% as of December 31, 2014 according to the China Bureau of National Statistics. 113 Table of Contents In addition to economic conditions, global equity and debt markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Global equity markets finished positively for the year ended December 31, 2014, with the S&P 500 Index up 13.7% and the MSCI World Index up 5.5%. Equity market volatility rose during the quarter as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, which began the quarter at 16.3 and ended at 19.2 on December 31, 2014, for an increase of 17.7%. The investment grade credit markets remained relatively flat, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 1.6% and the BoAML HY Master II Index up 2.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Within credit markets, spreads have widened while issuances reached record levels in 2014. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies may cause the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments. In addition, foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, the Euro fell 12% in 2014, while the British pound fell 6% last year relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency fluctuations can also affect our businesses which deal in cross-border trade. U.S. dollar appreciation relative to other currencies is likely to cause a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. investments to the extent unhedged, cause portfolio companies that export to the U.S. to suffer a decline in revenues, and make the exports of U.S. based companies less competitive. The recent unpegging of the euro-Swiss franc exchange rate also highlights potential risks of currency volatility. Interest rates can also materially impact the valuation of our investments, particularly those valued in whole or in part using a discounted cash flow analysis. In 2014, many global central banks cut interest rates as historic low rates combined with the fall in oil prices and below-potential growth heightened deflationary fears, particularly in China, Europe and Japan. According to Bloomberg, as at December 31, 2014, 10 year government bond yields for full year 2014 had declined by 97 basis points in China, 139 basis points in Germany, 41 basis points in Japan and 86 basis points in the U.S. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve ended its tapering campaign and has signaled a future rate increase. Our Private Markets portfolio contains several energy real asset investments whose values are influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. Such energy real asset investments had a fair value of $0.7 billion, as of December 31, 2014. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, the value of our energy real asset investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties decreased meaningfully. This decrease in value was primarily attributable to a drop in long-term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended December 31, 2014 with the greatest declines occurring in the fourth quarter. For example, the 2017 price of WTI crude oil declined from approximately $85 per barrel to $67 per barrel and the 2017 price of natural gas declined from approximately $4.22 per mcf to $3.76 per mcf as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

Business Conditions Our segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments. • Our ability to attract new capital and investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. Since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, alternative credit and hedge funds. In several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. We have also reached out to a new investor base of retail and high net worth clients. However, fundraising continues to be competitive and as two of our three flagship private equity funds have completed fundraising and our fourth flagship fund focused on Europe held its first close in 2014, the growth in AUM and FPAUM in the coming year may be lower. New capital raised for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $10.6 billion, $21.2 billion and $13.3 billion. • Our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital from our funds and our balance sheet. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments which have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in a reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. Equity invested for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were $3.8 billion, $7.4 billion and $10.2 billion, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were $0.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, such that 2014 reflects unusually high levels of activity for us on a historical basis. • Our ability to realize investments. The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically affects the value of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion. Since December 31, 2014, we have closed the strategic sales of Fotolia (media sector) and have received proceeds from the sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. that was completed on December 31, 2014. Pending transactions, the consummation of which are subject to closing conditions, include, as of February 20, 2015: Big Heart Pet Brands (consumer products sector) and Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector). Such sales, however, are episodic and reduced levels of sale activity in future quarters would reduce transaction fees, realized carry and distributions. 115 Table of Contents Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated CLOs. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds and CLOs, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those entities. In particular, in the majority of our consolidated funds and other investment vehicles, we hold a general partner interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds and vehicles. With respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. As of December 31, 2014, our AUM in our Private Markets segment included 20 consolidated investment vehicles and 13 unconsolidated investment vehicles. Our AUM in our Public Markets segment included 21 consolidated investment vehicles, including CLOs, and 68 unconsolidated investment vehicles. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds and entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests or appropriated capital on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Consolidation."" Key Financial Measures Under GAAP Fees and Other Fees and other consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other vehicles and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, (iv) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated and (v) consulting fees earned by entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. 116 Table of Contents Fees and other reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds and other entities, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. However, because those management and incentive fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds and entities, net income attributable to KKR is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds and other entities impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital. For a further discussion of our fee policies, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition."" Expenses Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. All employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain employees are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because employees are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to employees in excess of an employee's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution. With respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR allocates to its employees and other personnel a portion of the carried interest earned as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation and benefits expense for KKR employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations. General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, expenses incurred by oil and gas-producing entities (including impairment charges) that are consolidated and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. General, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors. 117 Table of Contents Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements."" Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. Dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies. Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances and other investments including credit instruments in which our consolidated funds and other entities invest. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from debt issued by KKR, including debt issued by KFN which was consolidated upon completion of the acquisition of KFN, credit facilities entered into by KKR, debt securities issued by consolidated CLOs and financing arrangements at our consolidated funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN. Debt securities issued by consolidated CLOs are supported solely by the investments held at the CLO vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro-rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. We also capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. See ""—Liquidity"". Income Taxes The KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes. Furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management Holdings Corp., and of the KKR Group Partnerships are subject to U.S. federal, state 118 Table of Contents and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. We also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to KKR Management Holdings Corp. We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships held by KKR Holdings, we expect this activity to continue. Appropriated Capital Appropriated capital represents the difference between the fair value of consolidated CLO assets and the fair value of consolidated CLO liabilities that is attributable to third party holders of the subordinated debt of consolidated CLOs. Changes in appropriated capital result from changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLO vehicles and the amount of net income (loss) of the consolidated CLOs that is attributed to third party interests will be reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital in the consolidated statements of operations to arrive at consolidated net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Segment Operating and Performance Measures The segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings L.P. and as such represent the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds or CLOs that KKR manages. We disclose the following financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. These financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP if available. We caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, 119 Table of Contents and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included within ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Segment Reporting"" and later in this report under ""—Economic Net Income (Loss)"" and ""—Segment Book Value."" Economic Net Income (Loss) (""ENI"") Economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of KKR's businesses inclusive of carried interest and related carry pool allocations and investment income. ENI is comprised of total segment revenues less total segment expenses and certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of non-cash equity-based charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the Equity Incentive Plan and other securities that are exchangeable for common units of KKR & Co. L.P.; (v) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items; (vi) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (vii) the exclusion of income taxes. Assets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's fixed income products; (iv) the value of outstanding CLOs (excluding CLOs wholly-owned by KKR); and (v) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR. AUM excludes those assets managed by entities where KKR does not hold more than a 50% ownership interest. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives management fees. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds or CLOs, for only those funds or CLOs where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. 120 Table of Contents Equity Invested Equity invested is the aggregate amount of equity capital that has been invested by KKR's investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's investments among its investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and replaces committed dollars invested. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which KKR is entitled to a carried interest and (ii) capital invested by KKR's investment funds, including investments made using investment financing arrangements. Gross Dollars Invested Gross dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital that has been invested by all of KKR's Public Markets investment vehicles in our private credit non-liquid strategies and is used as a measure of investment activity for a portion of KKR's Public Markets segment in a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's investment of capital across private credit non-liquid strategies for all the investment vehicles in the Public Markets segment. Such amounts include capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which KKR's Public Markets business is entitled to a fee or carried interest. Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. It does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in equity invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by KKR investment funds. Syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets and Other segment and across its investment platform. Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR's investment funds to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements. Adjusted Units Adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of KKR that is held by KKR & Co. L.P. (including equity awards issued under the Equity Incentive Plan), KKR Holdings and other holders of securities exchangeable into common units of KKR & Co. L.P. and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of KKR as if all outstanding KKR Holdings units, equity awards issued under the Equity Incentive Plan and other exchangeable securities had been exchanged for common units of KKR & Co. L.P. 121 Table of Contents Segment Book Value Book value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR's investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as KKR's overall liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of KKR excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders. Book value differs from KKR & Co. L.P. partners' capital on a GAAP basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings. Consolidated Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of operations of our three business segments in these periods, see ""—Segment Analysis."" The following tables set forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Year ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change ($ in thousands) Revenues Fees and Other $ 1,110,008 $ 762,546 $ 347,462 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Expenses Compensation and Benefits 1,263,852 1,266,592 (2,740 ) Occupancy and Related Charges 62,564 61,720 844 General, Administrative and Other 869,651 438,826 430,825 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Expenses 2,196,067 1,767,138 428,929 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Investment Income (Loss) Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 4,778,232 7,826,082 (3,047,850 ) Dividend Income 1,174,501 695,521 478,980 Interest Income 909,207 474,759 434,448 Interest Expense (317,192 ) (99,616 ) (217,576 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Investment Income (Loss) 6,544,748 8,896,746 (2,351,998 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (Loss) Before Taxes 5,458,689 7,892,154 (2,433,465 ) Income Taxes 63,669 37,926 25,743 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Income (Loss) 5,395,020 7,854,228 (2,459,208 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests (3,341 ) 62,255 (65,596 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Appropriated Capital 4,920,750 7,100,747 (2,179,997 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. $ 477,611 $ 691,226 $ (213,615 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 122 Table of Contents Fees and Other The net increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities of $164.8 million, an increase in transaction fees of $137.6 million and an increase in management fees of $37.3 million. The increase in revenue earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities was primarily the result of the acquisition of KFN, which owned oil and gas producing entities, completed on April 30, 2014, and to a lesser extent, growth in the activities of our other consolidated oil and gas producing entities. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by (i) an increase in the size of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended December 31, 2014 in our Private Markets segment and (ii) an increase in transaction fees in our capital markets business reflecting larger transaction sizes when compared to the prior period, including a capital markets fee received from the syndication of equity in First Data Corporation (financial services sector) of approximately $43 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our Private Markets segment had 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.4 billion compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2013. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of Avoca on February 19, 2014 and to a lesser extent new capital raised primarily in our Public Markets segment, partially offset by a decrease in management fees received from KFN as a result of our acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014, as management fees from KFN after that date are now eliminated in consolidation. Expenses The increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $430.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits of $2.7 million. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses is primarily due to an increase of approximately $330 million relating to the activities of our consolidated oil and gas producing entities which were not consolidated prior to the third quarter of 2013 as well as the activities of oil and gas producing entities acquired in the acquisition of KFN completed on April 30, 2014. This increase included an impairment charge of approximately $220 million relating to long-lived assets at our consolidated oil and gas producing entities. In addition, general, administrative, and other expenses increased as a result of (i) increased expenses attributable to Avoca which we acquired on February 19, 2014, (ii) expenses incurred by consolidated CLOs that were consolidated subsequent to the acquisition of Avoca and the acquisition of KFN, which was completed on April 30, 2014, and (iii) an increase in amounts accrued for litigation. The decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, (ii) lower carry pool allocations as a result of the recognition of a lower level of carried interest during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, partially offset by (i) an increase in cash compensation reflecting a higher level of fees as well as increased headcount and (ii) higher equity-based compensation relating primarily to additional equity grants under the Equity Incentive Plan. 123 Table of Contents Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 ($ in thousands) Private Equity Investments $ 4,586,193 $ 7,716,772 Other Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities 192,039 109,310 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities $ 4,778,232 $ 7,826,082 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities relate to our private equity portfolio. The following is a summary of the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities for private equity investments which illustrates the variances from the prior period. See ""—Segment Analysis—Private Markets Segment"" for further information regarding gains and losses in our private equity portfolio. Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 ($ in thousands) Realized Gains $ 6,224,683 $ 4,712,997 Unrealized Losses from Sales of Investments and Realization of Gains(a) (6,278,529 ) (4,155,261 ) Realized Losses (1,238,897 ) (1,048,778 ) Unrealized Gains from Sales of Investments and Realization of Losses(b) 1,233,070 1,058,710 Unrealized Gains from Changes in Fair Value 9,218,981 9,361,938 Unrealized Losses from Changes in Fair Value (4,573,115 ) (2,212,834 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities—Private Equity Investments $ 4,586,193 $ 7,716,772 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection with realization events where such gains become realized. (b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. The appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $2.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund III and North America Fund XI, respectively. Approximately 23% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, the most significant of which were gains on PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRAH), HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA), NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) and Yageo Corporation (TW: 2327). These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Tarkett S.A. (FP:TKTT), ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (XETRA: PSM) and Rundong Automobile Group (HK: 1365). Our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector), Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and WILD Flavors GmbH (consumer products sector). The unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Northgate Information Solutions (technology sector), Samson Resources (energy sector) and Toys R Us (retail sector). The unrealized gains were also offset by unrealized losses in our energy assets from our Natural Resources Fund and 124 Table of Contents Energy Income and Growth Fund of approximately $352 million. The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of WILD Flavors GmbH and Biomet, Inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of WILD Flavors GmbH completed in October 2014, and (iii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The decreased valuation of energy assets are generally related to decreases in commodity prices. Dividend Income During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received dividends of $178.6 million from Visma (technology sector), $171.6 million from Capsugel (healthcare sector), $162.1 million from Capital Safety Group (industrial sector), $87.7 million from WMF (consumer products sector) and an aggregate of $574.5 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from Capsugel, $139.7 million from Pets at Home (consumer products sector), $113.9 million from Visma, $85.6 million from Tarkett S.A. (manufacturing sector), $52.0 million from Santander Consumer USA (financial services sector) and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. Significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of debt instruments held by KFN including CLOs, subsequent to the acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014, as well as a net increase in the amount of credit instruments in our consolidated Public Markets investment vehicles, including CLOs acquired in the Avoca acquisition on February 19, 2014. Interest Expense The increase was primarily due to (i) interest expense associated with consolidated CLOs acquired in the Avoca and KFN acquisitions which were completed on February 19, 2014 and April 30, 2014, respectively, (ii) interest expense associated with senior and subordinated debt at KFN and (iii) interest expense on our 2044 Senior Notes issued on May 29, 2014. Income (Loss) Before Taxes The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income and increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in fees. Income Taxes The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of income in the KKR Group Partnerships that is subject to either corporate or local taxes, or both, as well as an increase in KKR & Co. L.P.'s ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from approximately 39.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to approximately 49.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in ownership subjects a greater level of income to corporate taxes. 125 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The decrease was primarily driven by the termination of our KKR Equity Strategies fund and to a lesser extent decreased investment income for funds and vehicles where noncontrolling interests are redeemable. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Appropriated Capital The decrease was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in investment income described above as well as a decrease in KKR Holdings's ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from approximately 60.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to approximately 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in income before taxes as described above, partially offset by an increase in KKR & Co. L.P.'s ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from approximately 39.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to approximately 49.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in ownership percentage was principally the result of the issuance of KKR common units in connection with the acquisition of KFN. The following tables set forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

The increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of Prisma as well as new capital raised primarily in our Public Markets segment. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase in the size and number of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended December 31, 2013 in our Private Markets segment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to an increase in incentive fees received from KKR Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. On April 30, 2014, KFN was acquired and from that date forward, management and incentive fees earned from KFN were eliminated. Expenses The increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $179.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expenses of $14.3 million. The increase in other general, administrative and other expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees in connection with the growth of our business, the acquisition of Prisma as well as a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund during the year ended December 31, 2013. The net decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, partially offset by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation as a result of the Prisma acquisition, increased headcount and an increase in fees and (iii) higher equity-based compensation relating to additional equity grants under the Equity Incentive Plan.

(b)Amounts represent the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses in connection with realization events where such losses become realized. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value in our private equity investments. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V., partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti Infratel Ltd. (IN: BHIN) and China Outfitters Holdings (HK: 1146). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors (retail sector) and Oriental Brewery (consumer products sector). The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources, Toys R Us and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed 128 Table of Contents investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd. (AX: SWM), Far East Horizon Ltd. (HK: 3360) and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. (HK: 1252). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH (manufacturing sector), which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation (financial services sector) and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. Dividend Income During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from Capsugel, $139.7 million from Pets at Home, $113.9 million from Visma, $85.6 million from Tarkett S.A., $52.0 million from Santander Consumer USA and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors, $95.0 million from SunGard (technology sector), $78.5 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. Significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. Significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. Interest Income The increase primarily reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles. Interest Expense The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt obligations in connection with our 2043 Senior Notes issued on February 1, 2013. Income (Loss) Before Taxes The decrease was primarily due to the factors described above, principally a decrease in dividends in investment income, an increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in fees. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The increase primarily reflects a higher level of investment income in vehicles that allow for redemptions by their limited partners. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Appropriated Capital The decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above as well as a decrease in KKR Holdings's ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from approximately 65.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to approximately 60.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. 129 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in KKR & Co. L.P.'s ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from 36.9% on December 31, 2012 to 41.6% on December 31, 2013. Segment Analysis The following is a discussion of the results of our three reportable business segments for years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Basis of Financial Presentation—Segment Operating and Performance Measures"" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. In connection with KKR's acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014, and the related increase in the amount of assets held by KKR, KKR's management reevaluated the manner in which it makes operational and resource deployment decisions and assesses the overall performance of each of KKR's operating segments. As a result, since June 30, 2014, KKR has modified the presentation of its segment financial information. Certain of the more significant changes between KKR's current segment presentation and its previously reported segment presentation reported prior to June 30, 2014, are as follows: • All income on investments is now attributed to either the Private Markets segment or Public Markets segment based on the character of the income generated. For example, gains from private equity investments are included in the Private Markets segment. Previously, income on investments held directly by KKR was reported in the Capital Markets and Principal Activities Segment. • Carried interest and other investment income (both realized and unrealized) is now included in total segment revenues as opposed to investment income. • Total segment expenses now include allocation to carry pool within compensation and benefits (both realized and unrealized), as opposed to such amounts being included in investment income. • The Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment has been renamed Capital Markets and Other. In connection with these modifications, segment information for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform to KKR's current segment presentation. Consequently, this information will not be consistent with historical segment financial results previously reported. While the modified segment presentation impacted the amount of economic net income reported by each operating segment, it had no impact on KKR's economic net income on a total reportable segment basis. Private Markets Segment The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Private Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 130 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2014 compared to year ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change ($ in thousands) Segment Revenues Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net Management Fees $ 453,210 $ 459,496 $ (6,286 ) Monitoring Fees 135,160 120,267 14,893 Transaction Fees 214,612 150,118 64,494 Fee Credits (198,680 ) (136,662 ) (62,018 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net 604,302 593,219 11,083 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Performance Income Realized Carried Interest 1,159,011 690,027 468,984 Incentive Fees — — — Unrealized Carried Interest 70,058 661,803 (591,745 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Performance Income 1,229,069 1,351,830 (122,761 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Investment Income (Loss) Net Realized Gains (Losses) 609,905 632,282 (22,377 ) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) (245,260 ) 252,466 (497,726 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Realized and Unrealized 364,645 884,748 (520,103 ) Net Interest and Dividends 90,499 (8,665 ) 99,164 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Investment Income (Loss) 455,144 876,083 (420,939 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Segment Revenues 2,288,515 2,821,132 (532,617 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits Cash Compensation and Benefits 239,161 231,911 7,250 Realized Allocation to Carry Pool 463,605 276,011 187,594 Unrealized Allocation to Carry Pool 33,430 282,003 (248,573 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Compensation and Benefits 736,196 789,925 (53,729 ) Occupancy and related charges 45,471 48,045 (2,574 ) Other operating expenses 168,021 154,982 13,039 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Segment Expenses 949,688 992,952 (43,264 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,424 1,498 (74 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Economic Net Income (Loss) $ 1,337,403 $ 1,826,682 $ (489,279 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assets Under Management $ 61,505,800 $ 61,242,900 $ 262,900 Fee Paying Assets Under Management $ 47,262,500 $ 50,156,300 $ (2,893,800 ) Equity Invested $ 7,223,400 $ 5,840,900 $ 1,382,500 Uncalled Commitments $ 18,272,400 $ 20,101,600 $ (1,829,200 ) Segment Revenues Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net The net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $64.5 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $62.0 million. The increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in the size of fee-generating investments completed. During the year ended December 31, 131 Table of Contents 2014, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.4 billion compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2013. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. See also discussion under ""—Assets Under Management"" and ""—Fee-Paying Assets Under Management"". Performance Income The net decrease primarily reflects a lower level of unrealized appreciation in our private equity portfolio in the 2014 period than in the 2013 period. While the value of our private equity portfolio increased in the 2014 period, the amount of appreciation was less than that in the prior period. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales of Oriental Brewery, WILD Flavors GmbH and Versatel GmbH (telecom sector). Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sale of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net unrealized carried interest income of $70.1 million included $1,098.2 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $1,028.1 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds. 132 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2014, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 12.8%. Increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 23% of the net increase in value for the year ended December 31, 2014, the most significant of which were gains on PRA Health Sciences, Inc., HCA, Inc., NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Yageo Corporation. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Tarkett S.A., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Rundong Automobile Group. Our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Biomet, Inc. and WILD Flavors GmbH. The unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Northgate Information Solutions, Samson Resources and Toys R Us. The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of WILD Flavors GmbH and Biomet, Inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of WILD Flavors GmbH completed in October 2014, and (iii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the sale of Oriental Brewery, the sale of WILD Flavors GmbH, the partial sale of HCA, Inc. and the sale of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAZZ). During the year ended December 31, 2014, we wrote off A.T.U Auto-Teile-Unger (retail sector) and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. and recognized realized losses. These 2014 write-offs did not have a significant impact on our 2014 net carried interest because these interests had already been substantially written down in prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the unrealized carried interest gain of $661.8 million included $1,174.6 million reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by $512.8 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. Increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended December 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Bharti Infratel Ltd. and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Toys R Us, Samson Resources, and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales 133 Table of Contents of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote off PagesJaunes Group (media sector) (currently known as Solocal Group SA (FRA: QS3)) and our remaining warrants in Eastman Kodak (technology sector) and sold our remaining investment in Seven West Media Ltd. realizing a modest loss. None of these write-offs had a material impact on our 2013 net carried interest because these interests had already been substantially written down in prior periods. Investment Income The net decrease is primarily due to a decrease in unrealized gains of $497.7 million and realized gains of $22.4 million, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest and dividends of $99.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, including the sale and partial sale of HCA, Inc., NXP Semiconductors N.V. and The Nielsen Company B.V. (NYSE: NLSN). Net unrealized losses are primarily related to the reversal of gains on sales of investments noted in the realized gains commentary above as well as declines in value of various investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and Samson Resources. For the year ended December 31, 2014, mark-to-market unrealized losses reflected in net unrealized losses relating to our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties were approximately $149 million, the majority of which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a decline in oil prices. These unrealized losses and reversals of gains upon realization events were partially offset by increases in value of various private equity investments including First Data Corporation, Alliance Boots GmbH and Biomet, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised primarily of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Intelligence, Ltd. These realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of PagesJaunes Group. Realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Alliance Boots GmbH, partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains primarily in connection with the sales of the investments noted in the realized gains commentary above. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $37.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our cash balances and other assets, (ii) $134.0 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets, including approximately $84 million received from our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and (iii) $80.7 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for KKR and KFN, a portion of which are allocable to the Private Markets segment. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $35.3 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $58.2 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for KKR, a portion of which is allocable to the Private Markets segment. The increase from the prior period is primarily due to an increase in dividend income in our private equity and energy investments portfolio, partially offset by higher allocations of interest expense to the Private Markets segment as a result of our 2044 Senior Notes issued on May 29, 2014 as well as interest expense relating to debt obligations at KFN subsequent to KKR's acquisition of it on April 30, 2014. 134 Table of Contents Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits The net decrease was due primarily to lower allocations to carry pool driven by the lower levels of unrealized carried interest, partially offset by an increase in realized carried interest and higher cash compensation and benefits primarily reflecting increased headcount and to a lesser extent a higher level of fees, which generally results in higher compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses The net increase was primarily driven by an increase in expenses for unconsummated transactions, also known as ""broken deal"" expenses, and to a lesser extent an increase in professional fee expenses reflecting the overall growth of this segment. Economic Net Income (Loss) This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in investment income and the decrease in performance income, partially offset by increases in management, monitoring and transaction fees, net and a decrease in segment expenses as described above. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014: ( $ in thousands) December 31, 2013 $ 61,242,900 New Capital Raised 6,056,000 Distributions (10,724,800 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (933,800 ) Change in Value 5,865,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2014 $ 61,505,800 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ AUM for the Private Markets segment was $61.5 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.3 billion, compared to $61.2 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised of $6.1 billion and appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $5.9 billion. These increases were partially offset by distributions to private equity fund investors of $10.7 billion comprised of $7.3 billion of realized gains and $3.4 billion of return of original cost. The appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $2.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund III and North America Fund XI, respectively. Approximately 23% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, the most significant of which were gains on PRA Health Sciences, Inc., HCA, Inc., NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Yageo Corporation. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Tarkett S.A., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Rundong Automobile Group. Our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Biomet, Inc. and WILD Flavors GmbH. The unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Northgate Information Solutions, Samson Resources and Toys R Us. The unrealized gains were also offset by unrealized losses in our energy assets from our Natural Resources Fund and Energy Income and 135 Table of Contents Growth Fund of approximately $352 million. The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of WILD Flavors GmbH and Biomet, Inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of WILD Flavors GmbH completed in October 2014, and (iii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The decreased valuation of energy assets are generally related to decreases in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2014, our AUM excluded approximately $0.3 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.8 billion in commitments in connection with other infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. Such commitments will not contribute to AUM unless and until we are entitled to receive fees or carried interest in accordance with our definition of AUM. Fee-Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014: ( $ in thousands) December 31, 2013 $ 50,156,300 New Capital Raised 5,298,500 Distributions (6,833,800 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (964,700 ) Change in Value (393,800 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2014 $ 47,262,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $47.3 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.9 billion, compared to $50.2 billion at December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) distributions to private equity fund investors, (ii) a reduction in FPAUM attributable to the invested capital of Energy Future Holdings due to its bankruptcy and (iii) a reduction reflecting the impact of our European Fund III entering its post-investment period. This decrease was partially offset by new capital raised of $5.3 billion relating primarily to additional capital raised in our Infrastructure Investors Fund II, European Fund IV and capital deployed in our 2006 Fund which earns fees on invested capital in its post-investment period. As of December 31, 2014, FPAUM excluded approximately $0.3 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and $2.8 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. Once these committed amounts are invested, management fees will begin to be earned with respect to such amounts, which will be accretive to our fees. Such commitments will not contribute to FPAUM unless and until we are entitled to receive management fees in accordance with our definition of FPAUM. 136 Table of Contents Equity Invested The increase was due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2013. Generally, the operating companies acquired through our private equity business have higher transaction values and result in higher equity invested, relative to transactions in our real assets businesses. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarter is volatile and consequently, a significant amount of equity invested in one quarter or a few quarters may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future quarters. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there were 96 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $21.8 billion compared to 70 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $17.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2014, our Private Markets Segment had $18.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. The following tables set forth information regarding the results of operations and certain key operating metrics for our Private Markets segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. 137 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012 Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change ($ in thousands) Segment Revenues Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net Management Fees $ 459,496 $ 423,921 $ 35,575 Monitoring Fees 120,267 116,565 3,702 Transaction Fees 150,118 96,454 53,664 Fee Credits (136,662 ) (97,362 ) (39,300 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net 593,219 539,578 53,641 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Performance Income Realized Carried Interest 690,027 475,707 214,320 Incentive Fees — — — Unrealized Carried Interest 661,803 773,325 (111,522 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Performance Income 1,351,830 1,249,032 102,798 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Investment Income (Loss) Net Realized Gains (Losses) 632,282 703,965 (71,683 ) Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) 252,466 227,156 25,310 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Realized and Unrealized 884,748 931,121 (46,373 ) Net Interest and Dividends (8,665 ) 123,965 (132,630 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Investment Income (Loss) 876,083 1,055,086 (179,003 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Segment Revenues 2,821,132 2,843,696 (22,564 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits Cash Compensation and Benefits 231,911 192,765 39,146 Realized Allocation to Carry Pool 276,011 190,283 85,728 Unrealized Allocation to Carry Pool 282,003 375,260 (93,257 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Compensation and Benefits 789,925 758,308 31,617 Occupancy and related charges 48,045 48,562 (517 ) Other operating expenses 154,982 147,253 7,729 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Segment Expenses 992,952 954,123 38,829 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,498 3,390 (1,892 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Economic Net Income (Loss) $ 1,826,682 $ 1,886,183 $ (59,501 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assets Under Management $ 61,242,900 $ 49,127,600 $ 12,115,300 Fee Paying Assets Under Management $ 50,156,300 $ 41,173,000 $ 8,983,300 Equity Invested $ 5,840,900 $ 3,026,300 $ 2,814,600 Uncalled Commitments $ 20,101,600 $ 14,271,100 $ 5,830,500 Segment Revenues Management, Monitoring and Transaction Fees, Net The net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $53.7 million and an increase in management fees of $35.6 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $39.3 million. The increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in both the size and number of fee-generating investments completed. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total 138 Table of Contents combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. The increase in management fees is primarily attributable to new capital raised in KKR North America Fund XI and KKR Asian Fund II, partially offset by the KKR 2006 Fund and KKR Asian Fund entering their post-investment periods with a lower management fee. As of December 31, 2013, FPAUM excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and $2.2 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. The inclusion of these amounts in FPAUM in future periods would be accretive to our fees. The investment period of our European Fund III ended on March 31, 2014, which reduced the fund's fee rate and changed the fund's management fee base from committed capital to invested capital. This resulted in a decrease in fees earned for European Fund III beginning in the second quarter of 2014. This decrease was not offset by a successor European private equity fund until such time as the successor fund has its first close and commenced its investment period, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Performance Income This increase was primarily driven by a lower level of management fee refunds. Management fee refunds amounted to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $113.4 million, as compared to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in European Fund III and European Fund II in the year ended 2012 which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds in that period. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR) and partial sale of HCA, Inc. 139 Table of Contents The following table presents net unrealized carried interest by investment vehicle for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 ($ in thousands) 2006 Fund $ 294,883 $ 449,429 European Fund II 169,819 181,420 European Fund III 124,463 123,746 North America Fund XI 34,389 — Co-Investment Vehicles and Other 22,009 71,981 E2 Investors 14,774 27,252 Real Estate Partners Americas 12,516 — Millennium Fund 12,128 637 China Growth Fund 6,937 (12,388 ) Asian Fund 148 151,514 European Fund 19 (76,543 ) Management Fee Refunds (30,282 ) (143,723 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total(a) $ 661,803 $ 773,325 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)The above table excludes any funds for which there was no unrealized carried interest during either of the periods presented, which for the year ended December 31, 2013, consisted of Asian Fund II. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $661.8 million included $1,174.6 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies which were partially offset by $512.8 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. Increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended December 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Bharti Infratel Ltd. and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Toys R Us, Samson Resources, and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote off PagesJaunes Group and our remaining warrants in Eastman Kodak and sold our remaining investment 140 Table of Contents in Seven West Media Ltd. realizing a modest loss. None of these events had a material impact on our net carried interest. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $773.3 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, partially offset by $367.8 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales of investments and management fee refunds. Of the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far East Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc. Investment Income The net decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net interest and dividends of $132.6 million and realized gains of $71.7 million which was partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains of $25.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised primarily of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Intelligence, Ltd. These realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of PagesJaunes Group. Realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Alliance Boots GmbH, partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains primarily in connection with the sales of the investments noted in the realized gains commentary above. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were the partial sales of Dollar General Corporation, Alliance Boots GmbH and HCA, Inc. These realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH, and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as 141 Table of Contents well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events as described above. For the year ended December 31, 2013, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $35.3 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $58.2 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for KKR, a portion of which is allocable to the Private Markets segment. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.8 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $140.6 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $31.4 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for KKR. The decrease from the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in dividend income in our private equity portfolio as well as higher allocations of interest expense to the Private Markets segment as a result of our 2043 Senior Notes issued on February 1, 2013. Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits This increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation and benefits reflecting a higher level of fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense, as well as increased head count. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses This increase was primarily driven by an increase in professional fee expenses reflecting the overall growth of this segment. Economic Net Income (Loss) The decrease in investment income as described above, partially offset by the increase in performance income and management, monitoring and transaction fees, was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income. Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013: ( $ in thousands) December 31, 2012 $ 49,127,600 New Capital Raised 13,613,100 Distributions (9,197,900 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (272,300 ) Foreign Exchange 32,800 Change in Value 7,939,600 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2013 $ 61,242,900 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ AUM for the Private Markets segment was $61.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $12.1 billion, compared to $49.1 billion at December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) new capital raised of $13.6 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas and 142 Table of Contents (ii) appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $7.9 billion. The increases were partially offset by $9.2 billion in distributions to private equity fund investors comprised of $6.0 billion of realized gains and $3.2 billion of return of original cost. The appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V., partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti Infratel Ltd and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources, Toys R Us and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on December 31, 2014. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. Fee Paying Assets Under Management The following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets FPAUM from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013: ( $ in thousands) December 31, 2012 $ 41,173,000 New Capital Raised 13,200,600 Distributions (3,860,800 ) Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (654,700 ) Foreign Exchange 172,700 Change in Value 125,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2013 $ 50,156,300 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ FPAUM in our Private Markets segment was $50.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.0 billion, compared to $41.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised of $13.2 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II which commenced its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas, which were partially offset by distributions of $3.9 billion to private equity fund investors and a reduction of $0.7 billion reflecting the impact of certain funds entering the post-investment period. Equity Invested The increase was due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012.

The increase in management fees is due primarily to our acquisition of Avoca on February 19, 2014 and new capital raised, primarily in our special situations strategies, Corporate Capital Trust (a BDC sub-advised by KKR) and our hedge fund of funds platform. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees received from KFN as a result of our acquisition of it on April 30, 2014 as management fees from KFN after that date are eliminated from segment results. The decrease in transaction fees is due primarily to a decrease in the size of fee earning transactions in the current period. The decrease in fee credits is due primarily to the decrease in transaction fees as described above. Performance Income This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in incentive fees of $24.6 million and a lower level of unrealized carried interest of $22.3 million, partially offset by a higher level of realized carried interest of $34.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized $34.7 million of carried interest from two alternative credit accounts. The decrease in incentive fees is due to a decrease in investment income in our hedge funds business and loss of incentive fees received from KFN as a result of our acquisition of it on April 30, 2014, partially offset by an increase in incentive fees received from Avoca following our acquisition of Avoca on February 19, 2014, and Corporate Capital Trust resulting from favorable performance. Incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. Whether an incentive fee from KKR vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result are expected to vary significantly from period to period. The decrease in unrealized carried interest was primarily driven by the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by an increase in unrealized carried interest across our carry-earning funds, the most significant of which were in our special situations strategy. Investment Income The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total realized and unrealized gains of $180.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net interest and dividends of $142.5 million. The decrease in total realized and unrealized gains was due primarily to unrealized losses from reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and to overall reductions in value of our investments in CLOs, driven primarily by a decrease in the market value of underlying collateral, and specialty finance holdings, including those acquired in our acquisition of KFN, partially offset by realized gains from the sale of assets in our KKR Equity Strategies fund when it was terminated. The increase in interest and dividends is due primarily to more significant levels of investments in interest yielding CLOs and credit investments as a result of our acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014 and to a lesser extent our acquisition of Avoca on February 19, 2014. Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits The increase was primarily due to (i) higher compensation expenses relating to Avoca, which was acquired on February 19, 2014, (ii) higher allocations to carry pool driven by the higher levels of net 145 Table of Contents carried interest, as described above and (iii) an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with the increase in fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses This decrease was due to the net effect of a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in connection with the launch of a closed end fund in the 2013 period which was partially offset in the 2014 period by the operating expenses of Avoca, which we acquired on February 19, 2014. Economic Net Income (Loss) The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in investment income, increase in segment expenses and decrease in performance income, partially offset by the increase in management fees.

The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Avoca, which contributed $8.0 billion of FPAUM, $6.3 billion of new capital raised and $2.6 billion of CLOs partially owned by KKR that were not previously included in FPAUM and was not new capital raised during the period (included in Other above). These increases were partially offset by the acquisition of KFN, which reduced FPAUM by $2.7 billion, and $5.2 billion of redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles, the most significant of which were from our CLOs and hedge fund of funds platform. Equity Invested The increase is primarily due to a higher level of net capital deployed, primarily in our special situations and direct lending strategies partially offset by a lower level of capital deployed in our mezzanine strategy. Uncalled Commitments As of December 31, 2014, our Public Markets segment had $2.8 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions.

The increase in management fees is due primarily to a full year of results for KKR Prisma being reflected in 2013, the impact of our investment in Nephila, which was made during 2013 and new capital raised. Performance Income The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to (i) an increase in incentive fees received from KKR Prisma, which became part of KKR during the year ended December 31, 2012, (ii) incentive fees relating to our investment in Nephila and (iii) incentive fees from our KKR Equity Strategies platform. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. The increase in unrealized carried interest is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from a larger increase in the net asset values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior period. On April 30, 2014, KFN was acquired and from that date forward, management and incentive fees earned from KFN were eliminated. Investment Income The net increase was primarily due to an increase in total realized and unrealized gains of $11.5 million and an increase in net interest and dividends of $3.9 million. The increase in total realized and unrealized gains was due primarily to higher net overall appreciation in the value of our credit holdings, during 2013. The increase in interest and dividends is due primarily to a higher level of interest bearing credit investments in the 2013 period. Segment Expenses Compensation and Benefits The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in compensation and benefits from KKR Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012 and (ii) higher allocations to carry pool driven by the higher levels of net carried interest, as described above. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses The increase was primarily due to (i) the expenses of KKR Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, (ii) a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund and (iii) to a lesser extent an increase in operating expenses reflecting the continued growth of our Public Markets business. 149 Table of Contents Economic Net Income (Loss) The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in management fees, performance income and investment income, partially offset by the increase in segment expenses.

Syndicated Capital The increase is primarily due to an increase in the number and size of syndication transactions when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 10 syndication transactions for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to 7 syndication transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012. Segment Balance Sheet Our segment balance sheet serves as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The majority of our balance sheet consist of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR investment funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of KKR private equity funds and interests in CLOs, corporate loans, debt securities and energy and real estate assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014. Our balance sheet also holds other assets used in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies. 154 Table of Contents Investments Investments is a term used solely for purposes of financial presentation of a portion of KKR's balance sheet and includes majority investments in subsidiaries that operate KKR's asset management and other businesses, including the general partner interests of KKR's investment funds. Cash and Short-Term Investments Cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating KKR's liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's available liquidity. Cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. The impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of approximately $1.1 billion. Excluding approximately $0.2 billion of liquid short-term investments, cash and short-term investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2014.

Liquidity We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and CLOs and the effect of normal changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. Our primary cash flow activities on a segment basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends) as well as the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds and CLOs, (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our fund investors and unitholders and holders of certain exchangeable securities; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $1.1 billion. 156 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLO entities; (iv) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets; and (v) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our common units described below. With respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2014, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. As of December 31, 2014, netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds, the most significant of which was our European Fund II, overseas 2006 Fund and domestic Millennium Fund, which had netting holes of approximately $373 million, $83 million and $77 million, respectively. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, funds may develop netting holes in the future and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. As of December 31, 2014, no private equity funds, other than the European Fund II, overseas 2006 Fund and domestic Millennium Fund, had a netting hole greater than $60 million. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these sources of funding. Revolving Credit Agreements The following is a summary of KKR's revolving credit agreements, which may be used in the normal course of our operations. • On October 22, 2014, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships., as borrowers, entered into a credit agreement (the ""Corporate Credit Agreement"") with certain lending institutions and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Administrative Agent and simultaneously terminated its existing credit agreement dated February 26, 2008, as amended 157 Table of Contents from time to time, with no amounts outstanding at the time of termination. The Corporate Credit Agreement provides the borrowers with a senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, as of the closing date, with the option to request an increase in the facility amount of up to an additional $250 million, for an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining new or increased commitments from new or existing lenders. The credit facility is a five-year facility, scheduled to mature on October 22, 2019, with the borrowers' option to extend the maturity date, subject to the consent of the applicable lenders, and the borrowers may prepay, terminate or reduce the commitments under the credit facility at any time without penalty. Interest on borrowings under the credit facility will be based on either London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Alternate Base Rate, with the applicable margin per annum in excess of LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate based on a corporate ratings-based pricing grid ranging from 69 basis points to 120 basis points (for LIBOR borrowings). Borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by KKR & Co. L.P. and any other entity (other than the borrowers) that guarantees the 2020 Senior Notes, 2043 Senior Notes or the 2044 Senior Notes. As of February 20, 2015, a letter of credit in the amount of $20.0 million was outstanding under the Corporate Credit Agreement. Other than this letter of credit, no borrowings were outstanding under the Corporate Credit Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2014. • On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets Holdings L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the ""KCM Credit Agreement"") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit. On March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition to extending the terms, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a reduction of the cost of funding on amounts drawn and a reduced commitment fee. Borrowings under this facility may only be used for our capital markets business, and its only obligors are entities involved in our capital markets business, and its liabilities are non-recourse to other parts of KKR's business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, a total of $751 million was borrowed of which $724 million was repaid under the KCM Credit Agreement. As of February 20, 2015, $27 million of borrowings were repaid and there were no outstanding borrowings under the KCM Credit Agreement. Senior Notes • On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co.

L.P. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale by us from time to time of up to 5,000,000 common units of KKR & Co. L.P. to generate cash proceeds (a) up to (1) the amount of withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, the KKR Financial Holdings LLC 2007 Share Incentive Plan (the ""KFN Share Incentive Plan"") and the KKR Asset Management LLC 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the ""KAM Share Incentive Plan""), and together with the Equity Incentive Plan and the KFN Share Incentive Plan, the ""Plans"", and (2) the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Plans that are settled in cash instead of common units; and (b) to the extent the net proceeds from the sale of common units exceeds the amounts due under clause (a), for general corporate purposes. The administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan is expected to reduce the maximum number of common units eligible to be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan by the number of common units issued and sold pursuant to this Registration Statement, as applicable, unless such reduction is already provided for with respect to such awards under the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan. No additional equity awards will be issued under the KFN Share Incentive Plan or the KAM Share Incentive Plan. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statement effective on June 4, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, 861,731 common units have been issued and sold under the registration statement and are included in our basic common units outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: • continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; • warehouse an investment in a portfolio company or other investment for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or CLOs pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles; • service debt obligations, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments; • fund cash operating expenses and amounts recorded for litigation matters; • pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings; • make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy; • underwrite commitments within our capital markets business; • fund our equity commitment to joint ventures such as Merchant Capital Solutions LLC; • make future purchase price payments in connection with our proprietary acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Prisma and minority interest in certain hedge fund managers, including Nephila; and • acquire additional principal assets, including other investment advisory and broker-dealer businesses. 162 Table of Contents See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Capital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. In addition, we are responsible for certain limited partner interests in some of our private equity funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2014: Uncalled Commitments ($ in thousands) Private Markets European Fund IV $ 192,700 Energy Income and Growth Fund 191,100 North America Fund XI 171,000 Real Estate Partners Americas 128,600 Infrastructure II 121,600 European Fund III 53,700 Asian Fund II 52,000 2006 Fund 23,400 Other Private Markets Funds 19,000 Co-Investment Vehicles 29,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Private Markets Commitments 982,600 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Public Markets Special Situations Vehicles 218,700 Direct Lending Vehicles 16,300 Mezzanine Fund 11,700 Other Credit Vehicles 2,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Public Markets Commitments 248,700 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Uncalled Commitments $ 1,231,300 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ As of December 31, 2014, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $1,231.3 million, as shown above, to its active private equity and other investment vehicles, (ii) $367.3 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business, (iii) $128.6 million relating to Merchant Capital Solutions as described below and (iv) other investment commitments of $170.9 million. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding. Prisma Capital Partners On October 1, 2012, KKR acquired all of the equity interests of Prisma subject to potential purchase price payments in 2014 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2014, $123.6 million was paid with approximately $84.1 million settled with the issuance of approximately 3.7 million KKR & Co. L.P. common units. KKR may become obligated to make future purchase price payments in 2017 based on whether the Prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such year. KKR has the right in its sole discretion to pay a portion of such future purchase price payments, if any, in KKR & Co. L.P. common units rather than in cash. See ""—Liquidity—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis."" 163 Table of Contents Merchant Capital Solutions Merchant Capital Solutions LLC (MCS, formerly known as MerchCap Solutions LLC) is a joint venture partnership with Stone Point Capital and CPPIB Credit Investments, Inc. MCS seeks to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as make certain balance sheet investments to support client needs. KKR and Stone Point each committed $150 million of equity and CPPIB committed an additional $50 million to MCS to support its business. KKR's remaining commitment is approximately $128.6 million as of December 31, 2014. KKR expects that certain capital markets activities for third parties (other than KKR and its portfolio companies) will be principally conducted by MCS. Tax Receivable Agreement We and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to current and former principals who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR common units as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms. These payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings and its current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. 164 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $5.7 million, $4.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31, 2014, $2.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized. Distributions Our current distribution policy is to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business, 40% of the net realized investment income of KKR (other than KFN), and 100% of the net realized investment income of KFN, in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations. For purposes of our distribution policy, our distributions are expected to consist of (i) FRE (as defined below), (ii) carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool, (iii) 40% of the net realized investment income from KKR (other than KFN) and (iv) 100% of the net realized investment income from KFN. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) segment non-controlling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above. The declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P., which may change the distribution policy at any time, and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment of their tax liabilities as limited partners of KKR & Co. L.P. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships (the holding companies of the KKR business), KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships. 165 Table of Contents The following table presents our distribution for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as described above. Year Ended December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 ($ in thousands except per unit data) Total Distributable Earnings 2,028,924 1,455,878 1,449,396 Less: estimated current corporate income taxes (97,088 ) (98,814 ) (66,733 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distributable Earnings, net of taxes 1,931,836 1,357,064 1,382,663 Less: Undistributed net realized investment income—KKR (ex-KFN) (450,821 ) (394,285 ) (544,395 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distributed Earnings $ 1,481,015 $ 962,779 $ 838,268 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Distributable Earnings, net of taxes per KKR & Co.

L.P. common unit $ 0.67 $ 0.43 $ 0.50 Payout Ratio 76.7 % 70.9 % 60.6 % Total Distributable Earnings Total distributable earnings is the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool, (iii) net realized investment income—KKR (ex-KFN) and (iv) net realized investment income—KFN; less (i) applicable local income taxes, if any, and (ii) noncontrolling interests. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses), and amounts available for distribution to KKR unitholders. However, total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under KKR's current distribution policy. See our distribution table above for the actual cash distribution declared for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Total distributable earnings were $2,028.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $573.0 million, compared to $1,455.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry, net of allocation to carry pool of $302.2 million, an increase in net realized investment income of KFN of $150.2 million, which was acquired on April 30, 2014 and an increase in net realized investment income of KKR (ex-KFN) of $94.2 million, partially offset by an increase in cash compensation and benefits of $55.9 million. Total distributable earnings were $1,455.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, compared to $1,449.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry, net of allocation to carry pool of $128.6 million and an increase in fees of $204.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in net realized 166 Table of Contents investment income of KKR (ex-KFN) of $209.6 million and an increase in cash compensation and benefits of $71.0 million. Distribution per KKR & Co. L.P. common unit was $1.90 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.50 per common unit, compared to $1.40 per common unit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry per common unit of $0.31 and distributable net realized investment income—KFN per common unit of $0.19 as a result of our acquisition of KFN on April 30, 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in after-tax FRE primarily due to an increase in adjusted units eligible for distribution primarily as a result of the KFN acquisition on April 30, 2014. Distribution per KKR & Co. L.P. common unit was $1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $0.18 per common unit, compared to $1.22 per common unit for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry per common unit of $0.17 and an increase in after-tax FRE per common unit of $0.10, partially offset by a decrease in distributed net realized investment income—KKR (ex-KFN) per common unit of $0.09. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. on a GAAP basis to ENI, FRE, Fee and Yield Earnings, Fee and Yield EBITDA, Total Distributable Earnings and Total EBITDA is provided below. Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"") Fee related earnings is comprised of (i) total management, monitoring and transaction fees, net, plus incentive fees, less (ii) cash compensation and benefits, occupancy and related charges and other operating expenses. This measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments before carried interest and related carry pool allocations and investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity-based charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. After tax FRE represents FRE after deductions for current corporate and local income taxes and non-controlling interests. Net Realized Investment Income—KKR (ex-KFN) Net realized investment income—KKR (ex-KFN) refers to net cash income from (i) realized investment gains and losses excluding certain realized investment losses to the extent unrealized losses on these investments were recognized prior to the combination with KPE on October 1, 2009, (ii) dividend income, and (iii) interest income net of interest expense in each case generated by KKR (excluding KFN). This term describes a portion of KKR's quarterly distribution and excludes net realized investment income of KFN. Realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized investment income as described above in (i) above amounted to approximately $56 million and $205 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 167 Table of Contents Net Realized Investment Income—KFN Net realized investment income—KFN refers to net cash income from (i) realized investment gains and losses, (ii) dividend income and (iii) interest income net of interest expense less certain general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized investment income in each case generated by KFN. This term describes a portion of KKR's quarterly distribution. Fee and Yield Earnings Fee and yield earnings is comprised of FRE and net interest and dividends from KKR's business segments. This measure is used by management as a measure of the cash earnings of KKR and its business segments' investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides 168 Table of Contents insight into the amount of KKR's cash earnings, significant portions of which tend to be more recurring than realized carried interest and net realized gains from quarter to quarter.

We generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. 169 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2014 on an unconsolidated basis before the consolidation of funds and CLOs: Payment due by Period Types of Contractual Obligations <1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years >5 Years Total ($ in millions) Uncalled commitments to investment funds(1) $ 1,231.3 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,231.3 Debt payment obligations(2) — 27.0 — 2,157.3 2,184.3 Interest obligations on debt(3) 131.0 249.6 245.1 2,096.7 2,722.4 Underwriting commitments(4) 299.0 — — — 299.0 Lending commitments(5) 68.3 — — — 68.3 Other commitments(6) 299.5 — — — 299.5 Lease obligations 50.3 94.7 76.7 60.9 282.6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 2,079.4 $ 371.3 $ 321.8 $ 4,314.9 $ 7,087.4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (1)These uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years.

The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement, because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2014, a payable of $121.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $13.3 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement."" 170 Table of Contents The commitment table above excludes certain contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2014, the recorded amount of contingent consideration obligations where the amounts are not currently known was approximately $40.6 million. The commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters. See ""Financial Statements—Note 16 ""Commitments and Contingencies."" In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. In addition, certain of our consolidated funds and KFN have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. However, based on prior experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be low. The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds and vehicles relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds. Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the KPE Transaction, as of December 31, 2014, no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2014 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback obligation would have been $2,288.9 million. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Certain private equity funds that were contributed to us in the KPE Transaction in 2009 also include a ""net loss sharing provision."" Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2014, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $277.4 million as of December 31, 2014. 171 Table of Contents Prior to the KPE Transaction in 2009, certain principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $191.4 million as of December 31, 2014. Using valuations as of December 31, 2014, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by principals. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and to principals who participate in the carry pool. Unlike the clawback obligation, we will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and CLOs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2014. This table differs from the table presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds and CLOs.

(2)Amounts include (i) the 2020 Senior Notes, 2043 Senior Notes and 2044 Senior Notes of $1.5 billion gross of unamortized discount, (ii) KFN 2041Senior Notes and KFN 2042 Senior Notes of $0.4 billion, net of unamortized premium, (iii) KFN Junior Subordinated Notes of $0.3 billion, gross of unamortized discount, (iv) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the funds of $1.0 billion and 172 Table of Contents (v) debt securities issued by our consolidated CLOs of $7.8 billion. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN. Debt securities issued by consolidated CLOs are supported solely by the investments held at the CLO vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro-rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. (3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2014, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)Represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. These commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated. (5)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. (6)Represents our commitment to MCS and investment commitments of KFN. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Merchant Capital Solutions."" The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2014, a payable of $121.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $13.3 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement."" The commitment table above excludes certain contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. As of December 31, 2014, the recorded amount of contingent consideration obligations where the amounts are not currently known was approximately $40.6 million. The commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters. See ""Financial Statements—Note 16 ""Commitments and Contingencies."" Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular, include our consolidated funds and CLOs notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds and CLOs. The assets of our consolidated funds and CLOs, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and CLOs involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; 173 Table of Contents (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds and CLOs are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $1.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $6.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments and principal payments net of purchases of investments by our funds and CLOs of $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $5.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $5.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $5.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $(0.7) billion, $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Certain KKR funds and CLOs are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(22.9) million, $15.5 million and $(220.9) million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, computer hardware and leasehold improvements of $12.2 million, $14.4 million and $37.0 million, change in restricted cash and cash equivalents (that primarily funds collateral requirements) of $(10.8) million, $(29.9) million and $(2.9) million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively proceeds from sales of oil and natural gas properties, net of development of oil and natural gas properties of $(151.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as well as cash acquired, net of cash paid for acquisitions of $151.5 million and $(186.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.9) billion, $(2.5) billion and $(5.6) billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests, of $(2.7) billion, $(2.8) billion and $(4.9) billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; (ii) proceeds received net of repayment of debt obligations of $1.7 billion, $0.8 billion and $(0.4) billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and (iii) distributions to our partners of $(0.8) billion, $(0.4) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, 174 Table of Contents judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The types of entities with which KKR is involved generally include (i) subsidiaries, including management companies, broker-dealers and general partners of investment funds that KKR manages, (ii) entities that have all the attributes of an investment company like investment funds, (iii) CLOs and (iv) other entities, including entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. Each of these entities is assessed for consolidation on a case by case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding that entity. Pursuant to its consolidation policy, KKR first considers whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity (""VIE"") and therefore whether to apply the consolidation guidance under the VIE model. Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities (""VOEs"") under the voting interest model. The consolidation rules were revised effective January 1, 2010 which had the effect of changing the criteria for determining whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. However, the adoption of these new consolidation rules was indefinitely deferred (the ""Deferral"") for a reporting entity's interests in certain entities. In particular, entities that have all the attributes of an investment company such as investment funds generally meet the conditions necessary for the Deferral. Entities that are securitization or asset-backed financing entities such as CLOs would generally not qualify for the Deferral. Accordingly, when making the assessment of whether an entity is a VIE, KKR considers whether the entity being assessed meets the conditions for the Deferral and therefore would be subject to the rules that existed prior to January 1, 2010. Under both sets of rules, VIEs for which KKR is determined to be the primary beneficiary are consolidated and such VIEs generally include certain CLO vehicles and entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. With respect to KKR's consolidated funds that are not CLOs, KKR meets the criteria for the Deferral and therefore applies the consolidation rules that existed prior to January 1, 2010. For these funds, KKR generally has operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. As a result, a fund should be consolidated unless KKR has a nominal level of equity at risk. To the extent that KKR commits a nominal amount of equity to a given fund and has no obligation to fund any future losses, the equity at risk to KKR is not considered substantive and the fund is typically considered a VIE. In these cases, the fund investors are generally deemed to be the primary beneficiaries, and KKR does not consolidate the fund. In cases when KKR's equity at risk is deemed to be substantive, the fund is generally considered to be a VOE and KKR generally consolidates the fund under the VOE model. With respect to CLOs, which are generally VIEs, the criteria for the Deferral are not met and therefore KKR applies the consolidation rules issued on January 1, 2010. In its role as collateral manager, KKR generally has the power to direct the activities of the CLO entities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. In some, but not all cases, KKR, through both its residual interest in the CLO and the potential to earn an incentive fee, may have variable interests that represent an obligation to absorb losses of or a right to receive benefits from the CLO that could potentially be significant to KKR. In cases where KKR has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the CLOs economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the CLO or the right to receive benefits from the CLO that could potentially be significant to the CLO, KKR consolidates the CLO. Certain of KKR's funds and CLOs are consolidated by KKR notwithstanding the fact that KKR has only a minority economic interest in those funds and vehicles. KKR's financial statements reflect 175 Table of Contents the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income (loss) and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds and vehicles on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by fund investors or other stakeholders, are attributed to noncontrolling interests or appropriated capital in the accompanying financial statements. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by KKR from those funds and entities are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, KKR's attributable share of the net income (loss) from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR partners' capital. KKR's funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their investments, including investments in portfolio companies, even if majority-owned and controlled. Rather, the consolidated funds and vehicles reflect their investments at fair value as described below in ""Fair Value Measurements"". All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments Investments consist primarily of private equity, real assets, credit, investments of consolidated CLOs, equity method and other investments. Investments are carried at their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Further disclosure on investments is presented in Note 4, ""Investments."" The following describes the types of securities held within each investment class. Private Equity—Consists primarily of equity investments in operating businesses. Real Assets—Consists primarily of investments in (i) energy related assets, principally oil and natural gas producing properties, (ii) infrastructure assets, and (iii) real estate, principally residential and commercial real estate assets and businesses. Credit—Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans), distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in unconsolidated CLOs. Investments of Consolidated CLOs—Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans) held directly by the consolidated CLO vehicles. Equity Method—Consists primarily of investments in which KKR has significant influence, including investments in unconsolidated investment funds. Other—Consists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity, real assets, credit or equity method investments. Fair Value Measurements Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated funds and vehicles. KKR's funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial 176 Table of Contents instruments at fair value. KKR has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by KKR's funds are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. For investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle, KKR has elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and vehicles. In addition, KKR has elected the fair value option for the investments and debt obligations of the consolidated CLO vehicles. The carrying amounts of Other Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition (excluding Fixed Assets, Goodwill, Intangible Assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. Further information on Fixed Assets is presented in Note 7, ""Other Assets and Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities"". Further information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets is presented in Note 15 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets."" Further information on contingent consideration is presented in Note 14 ""Acquisitions."" KKR's debt obligations, except for KKR's 2020, 2043 and 2044 Senior Notes and KFN's 2041 and 2042 Senior Notes and certain Junior Subordinated Notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value. Further information on KKR's 2020, 2043 and 2044 Senior Notes and KFN's 2041 and 2042 Senior Notes and certain Junior Subordinated Notes are presented in Note 9, ""Debt Obligations"". The fair values for KKR's 2020, 2043 and 2044 Senior Notes were derived using Level II inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments. The fair values for KFN's 2041 and 2042 Senior Notes were derived using Level I inputs. The fair values for certain Junior Subordinated Notes were derived using Level III inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. See Note 5, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for further information on KKR's valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows: Level I Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt and securities sold short. We classified 10.9% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2014. 177 Table of Contents Level II Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 29.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2014. Level III Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. We classified 60.1% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2014. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2014 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset. A significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels I, II, and III, which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period. Investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. We do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price. Level II Valuation Methodologies Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of securities indexed to publicly-listed securities and credit and other investments. Credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask 178 Table of Contents prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. Our policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value. For securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security. Level III Valuation Methodologies Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level III consist primarily of the following: Private Equity Investments: We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. The first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used in both methodologies. For valuations determined for periods other than at year end, various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period. Also, as discussed in greater detail under ""—Business Environment"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, but may have a significant adverse impact on the value of our investments,"" a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. In certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. In addition, when a definitive agreement has been executed to sell an investment, KKR generally considers a significant determinant of fair value to be the consideration to be received by KKR pursuant to the executed definitive agreement. Upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies, except that the value may be higher or lower than such range in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement. When determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, we consider, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis, the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment, and in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement, the probability of such sale being completed. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. Across the Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 58.3% of the fair value is derived from investments 179 Table of Contents that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of the Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2014, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology and a methodology based on pending sales for our Level III private equity investments were 40% and 40% and 20%, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we believe that the approach of using the market multiples methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology and valuations based on pending sales resulted in valuations of our aggregate Level III private equity portfolio that were only 2.7% higher than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and only 1.0% lower than if only the market comparables methodology had been used. When an illiquidity discount is to be applied, we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum 5% discount to all private equity investments. We then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. These factors generally include (i) whether we are unable to freely sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. These factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the time horizon over which an investment may be monetized. Depending on the applicability of these factors, we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5% minimum, and during the time we hold the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time, based on changes to these factors. The amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment. Accordingly, the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations. Real Assets Investments: Real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Infrastructure investments are generally valued using the discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Energy investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in this methodology that require estimates include commodity price forecasts and the weighted average cost of capital. Certain energy investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. In addition, the valuations of energy investments generally incorporate both commodity prices as quoted on indices and long-term commodity price forecasts, which may be substantially different from, and are currently higher than, commodity prices on certain indices for equivalent future dates. Long-term commodity price forecasts are utilized to capture the value of the investments across a range of commodity prices within the energy investment portfolio associated with future development and to reflect price expectations that are estimated to be required to balance demand and production in global commodity markets over the long-term. Real estate investments are generally valued using a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in such methodologies that require estimates include an unlevered discount rate and current capitalization rate, and certain real estate investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. The valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs. 180 Table of Contents During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, the value of our energy real asset investments in oil and gas producing properties decreased meaningfully. This decrease in value was primarily attributable to a drop in long-term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended December 31, 2014 with the greatest declines occurring in the fourth quarter. The 2017 price of WTI crude oil declined from approximately $85 per barrel to $67 per barrel and the 2017 price of natural gas declined from approximately $4.22 per mcf to $3.76 per mcf as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, respectively. On a segment basis, our energy real asset investments in oil and gas producing properties as of December 31, 2014 had a fair value of approximately $695 million. Based on this fair value, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of these energy investments from one or more adverse movements to the investments' valuation inputs would result in a decline in investment income of $69.5 million and a decline in net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. of $37.2 million, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings L.P. As of December 31, 2014, if we were to value our energy investments using only the commodity prices as quoted on indices and did not use long-term commodity price forecasts and also held all other inputs to their valuation constant, we estimate that investment income would have been approximately $115 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting in a lower amount of net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. of 53.5% of the overall decrease in investment income, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings L.P. These hypothetical declines relate only to investment income. There would be no current impact on KKR's carried interest since all of the investment funds which hold these types of energy investments have investment values that are below their cost and as such are not currently accruing carried interest. Additionally, there would be no impact on fees since fees earned from investment funds which hold investments in oil and gas producing properties are based on either committed capital or capital invested. For GAAP purposes, where KKR holds energy investments consisting of working interests in oil and gas producing properties directly and not through an investment fund, such working interests are consolidated based on the proportion of the working interests held by us. Accordingly, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated working interests on a gross basis and changes in the value of these energy investments are not reflected as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, a change in fair value for these investments does not result in a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities. However, management believes that a decrease in investment income associated with these energy investments of the magnitude described above would have resulted in an impairment charge reflected in general, administrative and other expenses in an amount not dissimilar to the decline in investment income associated with the energy real asset investments on a segment basis as described above. For segment purposes, these directly held working interests are treated as investments and changes in value are reflected in our segment results as unrealized gains and losses. Credit Investments: Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of values determined by an independent valuation firm. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers. Other Investments: We generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments. 181 Table of Contents CLO Debt Obligations: Collateralized loan obligation secured notes are initially valued at transaction price and are subsequently valued using a third party valuation service. The most significant inputs to the valuation of these instruments are default and loss expectations and discount margins. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements"" of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies. Level III Valuation Process The valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. We have a Private Markets valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit (including investments held by consolidated CLOs) and other investments. The Private Markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of real estate investments. Each of the Private Markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of the investments being valued. The valuation teams for energy, infrastructure and real estate investments include investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing our quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For Private Markets investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations annually for all Level III investments in Private Markets and quarterly for investments other than investments which fall below pre-set value thresholds and which in the aggregate have comprised a de minimis percentage of the total value of our Level III Private Markets investments. For most investments classified as Level III in credit, in general, an independent valuation firm is engaged by us to provide third party valuations, or ranges of valuations from which our investment professionals select a preliminary valuation, or an independent valuation firm is engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations. Credit investments, which in the aggregate amount to approximately 7% of the total value of our Level III credit investments, are not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm. All preliminary valuations in Private Markets and credit are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to the firm's management committee. When these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors. As of December 31, 2014, upon completion by, where applicable, an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR, of Private Markets investments reviewed by 182 Table of Contents them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. As described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time. Changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under ""—Key Financial Measures—Investment Income (Loss)—Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities."" Based on the investments of our private equity funds as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments. As of December 31, 2014, investments which represented greater than 5% of consolidated investments consisted of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (the company resulting from Walgreen's acquisition of Alliance Boots GmbH) and First Data Corporation valued at $5.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. On a segment basis, as of December 31, 2014, investments which represented greater than 5% of total reportable segments investments consisted of First Data Corporation and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. valued at $1,123.5 million and $738.3 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs and other vehicles and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, (iv) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated and (v) consulting fees earned by entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. Recognition of Investment Income Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated CLOs. 183 Table of Contents Unrealized gains or losses resulting from the aforementioned activities are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Upon disposition of an instrument that is marked-to-market, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes. Due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements. Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of Operations Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Clawback Provision The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a carry-paying fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to 184 Table of Contents the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance hurdle. Prior to the KPE Transaction, certain principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to KKR had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $191.4 million as of December 31, 2014. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to KKR and principals who participate in the carry pool. Net Loss Sharing Provision Certain private equity funds that were contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction also include a ""net loss sharing provision."" Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by KKR to fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Unlike the clawback obligation, KKR will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Foreign Currency Matters In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, ""Foreign Currency Matters,"" which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment (""CTA"") related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a (i) sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, (ii) loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity, or (iii) step acquisition for a foreign entity. This guidance was effective as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. Amendments to Investment Company Scope, Measurement, and Disclosures In June 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-08, Financial Services—Investment Companies Topic 946 (""ASU 2013-08"") which amends the scope, measurement, and disclosure requirements for investment companies. ASU 2013-08 (i) amends the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, (ii) requires an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value rather than using the equity method of accounting, and (iii) introduces new disclosures. This guidance was effective as of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 (""ASU 2014-09"") which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for 185 Table of Contents revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Revenue recorded under ASU 2014-09 will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. KKR is in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements, including with respect to the timing of the recognition of carried interest. Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities—Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entities In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-13, ""Measuring the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity"" (""CFE""), such as CLOs. This standard provides that an entity with an election to measure the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated CFE should be measured on the basis of either the fair value of the CFE's financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. The effective date of the consensus will be for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 for public companies and early adoption will be permitted. KKR is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements. Going Concern In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (""ASU 2014-15""). The guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern as well as required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing interim and annual financial statements, management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This evaluation should include consideration of conditions and events that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, as well as whether it is probable that management's plans to address the substantial doubt will be implemented and, if so, whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. Derivatives and Hedging In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (""ASU 2014-16""). The guidance in ASU 2014-16 states that implied substantive terms and features of a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a stock should weigh each term and feature on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances. An entity should determine the nature of the host contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract. ASU 2014-16 is effective for reporting periods starting after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements. 186 Table of Contents Consolidation In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (""ASU 2015-02""). The guidance in ASU 2015-02 eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and also eliminates the consolidation model specific to limited partnerships. The amendments also clarify how to treat fees paid to an asset manager or other entity that makes the decisions for the investment vehicle and whether they should be considered in determining when a variable interest entity should be reported on an asset manager's balance sheet. ASU 2015-02 is effective for reporting periods starting after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. KKR is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements but expects to deconsolidate certain investment funds, vehicles and entities upon adoption of this guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to movements in the fair value of investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest and net gains from investment activities. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additionally, interest rate movements can adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive on credit instruments bearing variable rates and could also impact the amount of interest that we pay on debt obligations bearing variable rates. The quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. In all cases, these directional impacts are presented after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings L.P. As of December 31, 2014, KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings L.P. held interests in our business of 53.5% and 46.5%, respectively. The actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below. The firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks. Management of Market Risk When we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our two Co-Chief Executive Officers, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, must approve the investment or transaction before it may be made. The committee may delegate authority to other employees subject to maximum commitment sizes or other limitations determined by the committee. In addition, this committee supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and the composition of our balance sheet. Certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions, after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of 187 Table of Contents assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above. With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee, and then a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data and other information. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis. Management of General Business Risk KKR has a risk committee comprised of senior employees from across our business segments and across business operations, and includes our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our General Counsel. The risk committee monitors and evaluates KKR's general business risks, and is assisted by an employee dedicated to evaluating and monitoring market risk and coordinating such efforts across our businesses. The Chief Administrative Officer, who also serves as the chairman of the risk committee, regularly reports to our Co-Chief Executive Officers and quarterly to the Audit Committee, which is the chief committee that monitors risk on behalf of the Board of Directors. KKR's global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including conflicts relating to specific transactions and circumstances as well as those implicit in the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses and monitors compliance matters. Our Chief Administrative Officer, our General Counsel and our Chief Compliance Officer are members of this committee. KKR's management committee is responsible for evaluating certain matters affecting the business of KKR. It consists of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our General Counsel and other senior employees across our business segments and across business operations, and is chaired by our Chief Administrative Officer. The management committee is responsible for approving the valuations of our Level III investments in Private Markets and Public Markets. Changes in Fair Value The majority of our investments are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on investments held as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the consolidated 188 Table of Contents statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest, (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds and (iii) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations. Based on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. in 2015 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors: Year Ended December 31, 2014 Management fees Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool Allocation Net Gains/ (Losses) From Investment Activities Excluding Carried Interest ($ in thousands) 10% Decline in Fair Value of Investments(1) $ 9,353 (2) $ 256,223 (3) $ 524,707 (3) (1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at December 31st or June 30th of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees may have been earned. (2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees. (3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored. Management Fees Our management fees in our Private Markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Segments—Private Markets."" Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not significantly affect the amount of fees we may charge in Private Markets funds. In the case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund or vehicle for that particular period, although certain funds in our Public Markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested. To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the fund management fees that were recognized based on the NAV of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts was approximately 25%. Publicly Traded Securities Our investment funds and KKR's balance sheet hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities 189 Table of Contents for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our investments are comprised primarily of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these privately held investments may also fluctuate as our Level III investments are valued in part using a market comparables analysis. Consequently due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded, the value of these Level III investments may fluctuate with market prices. Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds and KKR's balance sheet hold investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. Our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros and British pounds), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest, (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds and (iii) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations. We estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments and fees were denominated as of December 31, 2014 (i.e. an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies) would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. in 2015 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors: Year Ended December 31, 2014 Management fees Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool Allocation Net Gains/ (Losses) From Investment Activities Excluding Carried Interest ($ in thousands) 10% Decline in Foreign Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar(1) $ 4,350 (2) $ 21,597 (3) $ 35,652 (3) (1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would only marginally impact our ability to earn incentive fees since the majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in U.S. dollars. (2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees. 190 Table of Contents (3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored Interest Rate Risk Valuation of Investments Changes in credit markets and in particular, interest rates, can impact investment valuations, particularly our Private Markets investments and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. Interest Income We and our consolidated funds hold credit investments, including CLOs that generate interest income based on variable interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to investments that generate yield since a meaningful portion of credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds earn income based on variable interest rates. However, the contractual interest rate structure for a large portion of our credit investments bearing variable rates have ""floors"" which establish a minimum rate of interest that will be earned. In the current low interest rate environment, a large portion of the credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds are earning interest at the contractual floor and therefore, for these investments, a decrease in variable interests rates would not impact the amount of interest income earned. With respect to consolidated funds and CLOs, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material since (i) many variable rate investments are subject to floors as described above and (ii) a substantial portion of this decrease would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. With respect to credit investments held by KKR outside of the consolidated funds, all of the interest income earned inures to KKR & Co. L.P., however a large portion of these investments are subject to floors as described above. Accordingly, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material. Interest Expense Our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements, certain investment financing arrangements and debt securities issued by CLO vehicles structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates. Changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that our consolidated funds would have to make. With respect to consolidated funds, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of 191 Table of Contents interest expense would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this increase would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. With respect to debt obligations held by KKR outside of the consolidated funds, as of December 31, 2014, KKR had $27 million of debt obligations outstanding that accrues interest at a variable rate. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense would be a decrease of approximately $0.3 million on an annual basis. Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward‑looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview of Business For a detailed discussion about our businesses, business segments and our firm, see “Item 1--Business.”Business EnvironmentMarket ConditionsGlobal Economic Conditions. As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably and our ability to make new investments. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis as of January 2016, real GDP in the U.S. increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2.4% for the full year ended December 31, 2015. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.0% as of December 31, 2015 compared to 5.6% as of December 31, 2014. As of January 2016, Eurostat projects GDP growth for the full year ended December 31, 2015 in the Euro Area of 1.5% relative to the prior year. Continuing controversy and uncertainty surrounding key issues such as immigration, austerity, and globalization and European Union exit risk surrounding Greece and the United Kingdom may continue to impair growth and lead to volatility. In the event of an exit, losses incurred by U.K. and Greek counterparties could have adverse repercussions across financial markets, which could adversely affect valuations within our European investments. As of January 2016, the IMF estimates that China’s economy will expand at a rate of 6.9% for 2015, lower than the 7.3% rate in 2014 but higher than its 6.3% estimate for 2016. This slowdown could adversely impact the value of our investments in China and the global economy generally, and other emerging markets, in particular, could also suffer from weaker Chinese imports of both their commodities and finished goods. In addition, the sharp correction and high volatility in China's stock market coupled with the devaluation of the Chinese yuan may adversely impact the value of our investments in China and make it more difficult to access capital in those markets. For a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see “Risk Factors- Risks Related to Our Business - Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.” Global Equity and Credit Markets. Global equity and debt markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our funds that generate carry. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth.Most of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. For the year ended December 31, 2015, global equity markets were mixed, with the S&P 500 Index up 1.4% and the MSCI World Index down 0.3% on a total return basis including dividends. However, since December 31, 2015, equity markets have fallen significantly, with the S&P 500 Index down 4.5% and the MSCI World Index down 6.0% on a total return basis including dividends as of February 22, 2016, adversely impacting, at least for the time being, the overall value of our equity investments, in particular our publicly traded securities, including our sizable holding of First Data Corporation (NYSE:FDC). As of February 22, 2016, the market prices of publicly held equity securities held through our private equity funds and in our Principal Activities segment have declined, which we estimate would result in a decrease of at least approximately $550 million to our economic net income in the first quarter of 2016 if the market prices of these securities do not appreciate or if the declines are not offset by gains in other investments or income elsewhere in our business. Of this amount, First Data Corporation accounts for approximately $350 million of the decrease. With respect to the total decrease to our economic net income, approximately 55.9% would be allocable to KKR & Co. L.P. The foregoing amounts do not reflect changes in value of any of our investments other than our publicly held equity securities and may not, therefore be reflective of 94Table of Contentsour business as a whole. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, ended at 18.2 as of December 31, 2015, remaining relatively unchanged from 19.2 as of December 31, 2014. However, since December 31, 2015, equity market volatility has increased meaningfully, rising from 18.2 as at December 31, 2015 to 28.1 as at February 11, 2016. For a further discussion of our valuation methods, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Assets We Manage - Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, and may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our financial condition and results of operations” in our Annual Report and “-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurements-Level III Valuation Methodologies” in this report.Many of our investments are in credit instruments, and our funds and their portfolio companies also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. Consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. In particular due in part to holdings of credit assets such as CLOs on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of such losses. Credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies used to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, with respect to our credit investments, increased credit spreads lead to a reduction in the value of these investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. Within credit markets, spreads have widened during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 with significant increases in spreads in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation also has negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies may cause the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. Areas such as the Eurozone and Japan, which have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the Unites States, could potentially endure further currency volatility and weakness relative to the U.S. dollar.The subinvestment grade credit indices fell during the year ended December 31, 2015, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index down 0.7% and the BoAML HY Master II Index down 4.6%. In the quarter ended December 31, 2015, government bond yields rose as the U.S. Federal Reserve increased the target range for the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, raising rates for the first time since December 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 10-year government bond yields rose 10 basis points in the United States and 9 basis points in Germany and fell 6 basis points in Japan and 80 basis points in China. For further discussion of the impact of global credit markets on our financial condition and results of operations, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Assets We Manage -Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds, their portfolio companies and strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets to obtain attractive financing for their investments or refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income,” “-Risks Related to the Assets We Manage - Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, and may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our financial condition and results of operations” and “- Because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us” and “-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurements-Level III Valuation Methodologies” in this report.Foreign Exchange Rates. Foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currency volatility, which has become more pronounced in recent quarters, can also affect our businesses which deal in cross‑border trade. The U.S. dollar has appreciated against a number of currencies over recent periods, which is likely to cause a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of our non‑U.S. investments to the extent unhedged, contributing to portfolio companies that export to the U.S. suffering a decline in revenues, and making the exports of U.S. based companies less competitive. While this may cause a decrease in the U.S. dollar values of our assets and portfolio companies outside the United States, we also expect it to create opportunities to invest at more attractive U.S. dollar prices in certain countries. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the euro and the British pound both fell 10.2 % and 5.4%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. In China, the potential for greater CNY depreciation remains a large source of uncertainty. The cumulative devaluation of the yuan since August 2015, which effectively makes Chinese exports cheaper and imports more expensive, may impact global trade substantially for the reasons discussed above. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk - Exchange Rate Risk” in this report.95Table of ContentsCommodity Markets. Our Private Markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments and certain of our Public Markets strategies and products, including direct lending, special situations and CLOs, have meaningful investments in energy sector. The value of these investments are heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil, which have declined meaningfully over the course of the year. The long-term price of WTI crude oil declined from approximately $67 per barrel to $50 per barrel and the long-term price of natural gas declined from approximately $3.77 per mcf to $2.90 per mcf as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Since December 31, 2015 the long-term price of WTI crude oil and natural gas has continued to decline with the long-term price of WTI crude oil at $45 per barrel and the long-term price of natural gas at $2.56 per mcf, in each case as of February 22, 2016. If such decline in prices persists or worsens or if it is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted. In addition, due in part to holdings of direct energy assets on our balance sheet, which had a fair value of $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2015, these price movements have had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of such losses. For additional information regarding our energy real assets, see “-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurements-Level III Valuation Methodologies-Real Asset Investments” in this report and “Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Assets We Manage - Because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us” in this report.Business ConditionsOur segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments.•Our ability to attract new capital and investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. Since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, alternative credit and hedge funds. In several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. We have also reached out to a new investor base of retail and high net worth clients. However, fundraising continues to be competitive. While we had several successful fundraises in 2015 for newer strategies such as real estate, European real estate, infrastructure, direct lending, mezzanine and special situations , there is no assurance that fundraises for other new strategies or successor funds will experience similar success in the future. While our flagship Americas fund has begun fundraising, our other flagship private equity funds have completed fundraising or are not expected to commence fundraising in early 2016. Consequently, our AUM, FPAUM and associated fees attributable to new capital raised may be lower than in prior years. New capital raised for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $21.2 billion, $13.3 billion and $19.8 billion, which in the case of new capital raised in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, includes our pro-rata portion of new capital of other asset managers in which we have a minority interest and the inclusion of new capital commitments for which KKR is eligible to receive fees or carried interest upon deployment of capital. •Our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital from our funds and our balance sheet. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments which have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. We have a long‑term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in a reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. Equity invested for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 were $7.4 billion, $10.2 billion and $7.7 billion, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 were $1.1 billion, $2.6 billion and $0.9 billion, such that 2014 reflects unusually high levels of activity for us on a historical basis.•Our ability to sell investments. The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically affects the value of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. For the fiscal years ended December 31 2013, 2014 and 2015, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $0.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion. Since December 31, 2015, we have closed the 96Table of Contentsstrategic sales of Dalmia Cement (manufacturing sector), Masan Consumer Corporation (consumer products sector) and Legends Outlets Kansas City (real estate asset). We have also completed a dividend recapitalization at US Foods (retail sector). Such sales, however, are episodic and reduced levels of sale activity in future quarters would reduce transaction fees, realized carry and distributions.Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated CLOs and commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities (""CMBS"", and together with CLOs, referred to hereafter as collateralized financing entities ""CFEs"").In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds and CFEs, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those entities. In particular, in the majority of our consolidated funds and other investment vehicles, we hold a general partner interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds and vehicles. With respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. As of December 31, 2015, our AUM in our Private Markets segment included 21 consolidated investment funds and 21 unconsolidated investment vehicles. Our AUM in our Public Markets segment included 32 consolidated investment vehicles, including CLOs, and 69 unconsolidated vehicles. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds and entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.

In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Overview of Business For a discussion about our businesses, business segments and our firm, see “Item 1--Business.”Business Environment Market Conditions Global Economic Conditions. As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably and our ability to make new investments. According to Bureau of Economic Analysis as of February 2017, real GDP in the U.S. increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% as of December 31, 2016, down from 5.0% as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Bloomberg estimates suggest that Euro Area real GDP growth was 1.6% on a year-over-year basis, compared to actual year-over-year growth of 2.0% in the prior year. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The referendum has resulted in significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the depreciation of many foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. In addition, continuing controversy and uncertainty surrounding key issues such as immigration, austerity, and globalization and risk of countries exiting the European Union continue to impair economic growth in the region and lead to financial market volatility. The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union and the European Union's inability to resolve other key issues could have adverse repercussions across financial markets, which could adversely affect valuations of our investments. On a year-over-year, seasonally adjusted basis, China’s National Bureau of Statistics indicated that real GDP grew 6.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016, slightly less than the 6.9% reported for the year ended December 31, 2015. Any future slowdown in China's growth could adversely impact the value of our investments in China. Furthermore, slowing Chinese growth could create dislocations in the global economy, particularly in other emerging markets where weaker Chinese demand for imported commodities and finished goods could impact economic growth. In addition, the sharp correction and high volatility in China's stock market coupled with the devaluation of the Chinese yuan may also adversely impact the value of our investments in China and make it more difficult to access capital in those markets.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, global equity markets were positive, with the S&P 500 Index up 12.0% and the MSCI World Index up 8.2% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility, ended at 14.0 as of December 31, 2016, decreasing from 18.2 as of December 31, 2015.

Credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies used to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightened credit spreads lead to an increase in the value of these investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. In addition, credit spreads generally tightened throughout the year ended December 31, 2016. Low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation also negatively impacts expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the euro fell 3.2% and the British pound fell 16.3% respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar with significant depreciation following the June 23, 2016, referendum in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the European Union. The depreciation of the British pound adversely affects the value of our pound denominated investments, to the extent unhedged and adversely affects the dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial pound denominated revenues. See “Risk Factors- Risks Related to Our Business - Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.” In China, the potential for greater depreciation of China's currency, the yuan, remains a large source of uncertainty.

Our Private Markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments and certain of our Public Markets strategies and products, including direct lending, special situations and CLOs, have meaningful investments in the energy sector. The value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil, which have varied over the course of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the long-term price of WTI crude increased approximately 13%, while the long-term price of natural gas was relatively stable. The long-term price of WTI crude oil increased from approximately $50 per barrel to $56 per barrel, and the long-term price of natural gas decreased from approximately $2.90 per mcf to $2.87 per mcf as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, respectively. While commodity prices have increased over the course of the year, if commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted. In addition, because we hold certain energy assets on our balance sheet, which had a fair value of $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2016, these price movements would have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses. For additional information regarding our energy real assets, see “-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurements-Level III Valuation Methodologies-Real Asset Investments” in this report and “Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Assets We Manage - Because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us”.Business ConditionsOur segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income.

While our flagship Americas private equity fund exceeded the size of its predecessor fund, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship private equity funds or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. If we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our AUM, FPAUM and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. New capital raised for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 was $13.3 billion, $19.8 billion and $28.8 billion. •Our ability to successfully deploy capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments which have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity.

The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically affects the value of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion. Since December 31, 2016, we have 101Table of Contentsannounced or closed the strategic sales or partial sales of Panasonic Healthcare Co. Ltd (healthcare sector), Gland Pharma Limited (manufacturing sector), Asia Dairy Holdings (consumer products sector), Capsugel (manufacturing sector), China Greenland Rundong Auto Group Limited (HK: 1365) and TVS Logistics Services Limited (services sector) and have completed secondary offerings for HCA Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HCA), Galenica AG (VTX: GALN), and US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE: USFD). Such sales and transactions, however, are episodic and reduced levels of sale activity in future quarters would reduce transaction fees, realized carry and distributions.Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of certain funds that are consolidated and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated CLOs and commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities, or ""CMBS"". We refer to CLOs and CMBS as collateralized financing entities or CFEs.On January 1, 2016, KKR adopted ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (""ASU 2015-02""). The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the de-consolidation of most of KKR's investment funds, but did not impact net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. under GAAP. KKR adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method. As a result, no retrospective adjustment is required and prior periods presented in this report under GAAP have not been impacted.When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-02, and the resulting de-consolidation of most of our investment funds, KKR's financial statements under GAAP no longer reflect the accounts of most of our investment funds and also reflect a significantly lower amount of noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, the amounts associated with the individual financial statement captions may be substantially less than those presented in prior periods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. L.P. and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Overview of Business For a discussion about our businesses, business segments and our firm, see ""Item 1. Business.""Business Environment Economic and Market Conditions Economic Conditions. As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors and our ability to make new investments. Financial and economic conditions in the United States, the European Union, Japan, China and other major economies are significant contributors to the global economy. As of December 31, 2017, the United States appears to be experiencing growth and signs of rising inflation, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to continue to raise its benchmark interest rate and reduce its balance sheet. In the United States, real GDP growth was 2.3% for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 1.5% in the prior year; the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1% as of December 31, 2017, down from 4.7% as of December 31, 2016; U.S. core consumer price index inflation was 1.8% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2017, down from 2.2% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2016; and the effective federal funds rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve was 1.3% as of December 31, 2017, up from 0.7% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the European Union appears to be experiencing growth with the expectation of rising inflation, and the European Central Bank is expected to taper its quantitative easing program in the near future. In the Euro Area, real GDP growth is estimated to be 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.8% in the prior year; the Euro Area unemployment rate was 8.7% as of December 31, 2017, down from 9.7% as of December 31, 2016; Euro Area core inflation was 0.9% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2017, flat compared to the prior year as of December 31, 2016; and the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the European Central Bank was 0.0% as of December 31, 2017, flat from 0.0% as of December 31, 2016. In addition, in March 2017, the United Kingdom triggered Article 50 to formally begin the process to exit from the European Union, which could, among other outcomes, significantly disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank of Japan is expected to continue its quantitative easing program, and the Chinese economy appears to be slowing slightly against the backdrop of certain economic reforms. In Japan, the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan was -0.1% as of December 31, 2017 as compared to -0.1% as of December 31, 2016; and in China, reported real GDP was 6.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017, above the 6.7% reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. These and other key issues could have repercussions across regional and global financial markets, which could adversely affect the valuations of our investments. Other key issues include (i) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, populist political parties and economic nationalist sentiments, (ii) regulatory changes regarding, for example, taxation, international trade, cross-border investments, immigration, and austerity programs, and (iii) increased volatility as the U.S. Federal Reserve potentially raises interest rates more frequently and/or in larger increments than in previous years and (iv) technological advancements and innovations that may disrupt marketplaces and businesses. For a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition."" 98Table of ContentsEquity and Credit Markets. Global equity and credit markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns, which also impacts our ability to generate incentive fees and carried interest. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. Areas such as the Eurozone and Japan, which have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the United States, could potentially experience further currency volatility and weakness relative to the U.S. dollar.Many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, global equity markets were positive, with the S&P 500 Index up 21.8% and the MSCI World Index up 23.1% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (the ""VIX""), a measure of volatility, ended at 11.0 as of December 31, 2017, decreasing from 14.0 as of December 31, 2016. For a discussion of our valuation methods, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition"" and ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.""Many of our investments are also in non-investment grade credit instruments, and our funds and our portfolio companies also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. Consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. In particular due in part to holdings of credit instruments such as CLOs on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of losses from credit instruments on our balance sheet. Credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies used to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to an increase, and widening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to a decrease, in the value of these credit investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. In addition, the significant widening of credit spreads is also typically expected to negatively impact equity markets, which in turn would negatively impact our portfolio and us as noted above. During the year ended December 31, 2017, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) tightened by 31 basis points and U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads (BofAML HY Master II Index) tightened by 59 basis points. The non-investment grade credit indices rose during the year ended December 31, 2017, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 4.1% and the BofAML HY Master II Index up 7.5%. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, 10-year government bond yields declined 4 basis points in the United States and declined 5 basis points in the United Kingdom, rose 22 basis points in Germany, were flat in Japan and rose 85 basis points in China.

For a further discussion of our valuation methods, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.""Foreign Exchange Rates. Foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. The appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar is expected to contribute to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. investments to the extent unhedged. In addition, an appreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to make the exports of U.S. based companies less competitive, which may lead to a decline in their export revenues, if any, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. Moreover, when selecting investments for our investment funds that are denominated in U.S. dollars, an appreciating U.S. dollar may create opportunities to invest at more attractive U.S. dollar prices in certain countries outside of the United States, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. For our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the depreciation in such currencies will generally contribute to the decrease in the valuation of such investments, to the extent unhedged, and adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial revenues denominated in such currencies, while the appreciation in such currencies would be expected to have the opposite effect. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the euro rose 14.1%, the British pound rose 9.5%, the Japanese yen rose 3.7%, and the Chinese renminbi rose 6.3%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see ""—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk—Exchange Rate Risk.""Commodity Markets. Our Private Markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other Private Markets and Public Markets strategies and products, including private equity, direct lending, special situations and CLOs, also have meaningful investments in the energy sector. The value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the long-term price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 5%, while the long-term price of natural gas was relatively stable. The long-term price of WTI crude oil decreased from approximately $56 per barrel to $53 per barrel, and the long-term price of natural gas decreased from approximately $2.87 per mcf to $2.82 per mcf as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively. When commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted. In addition, because we hold certain energy assets on our balance sheet, which had a fair value of $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2017, these price movements would have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses. For additional information regarding our energy real assets, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies—Real Asset Investments"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our funds and our firm through our Principal Activities segment may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly.""Business ConditionsOur segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments.Our ability to attract new capital and investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. Since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, growth equity, core, credit and, through strategic manager partnerships, hedge funds. In several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. We have also reached out to new clients, including retail and high net worth clients. However, fundraising continues to be competitive. While our Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III and our Real Estate Partners Americas II fund exceeded the size of their respective predecessor funds, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship private equity funds or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. If we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our AUM, FPAUM and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. New capital raised in AUM for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was $19.8 billion, $28.8 billion and $38.7 billion. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business.""100Table of ContentsOur ability to successfully deploy capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments that have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. Capital invested for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were $11.5 billion, $11.0 billion and $18.4 billion, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were $0.9 billion, $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion.Our ability to realize investments. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and result in lower-than-expected returns. Although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, the strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically, affect the valuation of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. When financing is not available or becomes too costly, it may be more difficult to find a buyer that can successfully raise sufficient capital to purchase our investments. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of certain funds that are consolidated and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated CLOs and CMBS. We refer to CLOs and CMBS as collateralized financing entities (""CFEs"").When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items.

The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world. For a description of the impact that COVID-19 had and may in the future have on our business, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, and it has caused and may further cause disruptions to our business and adversely affect our financial results"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition.""Economic Conditions. As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. Global and regional economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments. Financial and economic conditions in the United States, European Union, Japan, China, and other major economies are significant contributors to the global economy.In 2020, the U.S. economy experienced a sharp contraction in the first half of the year, as a result of COVID-19, expanded significantly in the third quarter, as states began to reopen, and experienced moderate growth in the fourth quarter as new COVID-19 restrictions and closures took effect in parts of the country that faced a resurgence of the virus. In the United States, real GDP contracted 3.5% for the full year ended December 31, 2020, compared to expansion of 2.2% in the prior year; the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.7% as of December 31, 2020, up from 3.6% as of December 31, 2019; the U.S. core consumer price index was 1.6% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020, down from 2.3% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2019; and the effective federal funds rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve was 0.1% as of December 31, 2020, down from 1.6% as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, the European Union's economy faced similar challenges due to COVID-19. Following the sharp downturn in the first half of the year, the signs of rebound in the third quarter were cut short in the fourth quarter as certain countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and England, reimposed restrictions and lock-downs as the number of COVID-19 cases surged across Europe. In the Euro Area, real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to expansion of 1.3% in the prior year; the Euro Area unemployment rate was 8.3% as of December 31, 2020, up from 7.4% as of December 31, 2019; Euro Area core inflation was 0.2% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020, down from 1.3% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2019; and the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the European Central Bank was 0.0% as of December 31, 2020, unchanged from December 31, 2019.In 2020, Japan's economy experienced a record COVID-19-related decline in the second quarter, but exhibited signs of slow recovery in the second half of the year. In China, after the emergence of COVID-19 in the first quarter and the government's efforts to control the spread, its economy experienced a moderate but steady growth for the remainder of the year. In Japan, the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan was -0.1% as of December 31, 2020, unchanged from December 31, 2019; and in China, reported real GDP growth is estimated to be 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, below the 6.0% reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.125Table of ContentsThese and other key issues could have repercussions across regional and global financial markets, which could adversely affect the valuations of our investments. Other key issues include (i) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, populist political parties, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding socioeconomic inequality issues, and the at-times partisan nature of U.S. government administration, which has potentially global ramifications with regards to policy, (ii) geopolitical uncertainty such as U.S.-China relations, (iii) regulatory changes regarding, for example, taxation, international trade, cross-border investments, immigration, and stimulus programs/rising levels of debt, (iv) volatility or downturn in stock and credit markets, (v) any unexpected shift in the central banks' monetary policies, (vi) technological advancements and innovations that may disrupt marketplaces and businesses, and (vii) further developments regarding COVID-19, in particular the rise of variants hindering the success of the vaccines and the length of time needed to vaccinate a significant segment of the global population. For a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.""Equity and Credit Markets. Global equity and credit markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns, which also impacts our ability to generate incentive fees and carried interest. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets, such as the present, raise substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. Areas that have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the United States could potentially experience further currency volatility and weakness relative to the U.S. dollar.Many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, global equity markets were positive, with the S&P 500 Index up 18.4% and the MSCI World Index up 16.5% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of volatility, ended at 22.8 as of December 31, 2020, increasing from 13.8 as of December 31, 2019. For a discussion of our valuation methods, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition"" and see also ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.""Many of our investments are also in non-investment grade credit instruments, and our funds and our portfolio companies also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. In addition, Global Atlantic makes significant investments in investment grade debt. Consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. In particular due in part to holdings of credit instruments such as CLOs on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of losses from credit instruments on our balance sheet. Credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to an increase, and widening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to a decrease, in the value of these credit investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. In addition, the significant widening of credit spreads is also typically expected to negatively impact equity markets, which in turn would negatively impact our portfolio and us as noted above. During the year ended December 31, 2020, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) expanded by 2 basis points and U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads (BofAML HY Master II Index) expanded by 26 basis points. The non-investment grade credit indices were up during the year ended December 31, 2020, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 3.1% and the BAML US High Yield Index up 6.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 10-year government bond yields fell 100 basis points in the United States, fell 63 basis points in the United Kingdom, fell 38 basis points in Germany, remained flat in China, and rose 3 basis point in Japan.

For a further discussion of our valuation methods, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.""Foreign Exchange Rates. Foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. The appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar is expected to contribute to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. investments to the extent unhedged. In addition, an appreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to make the exports of U.S. based companies less competitive, which may lead to a decline in their export revenues, if any, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. Moreover, when selecting investments for our investment funds that are denominated in U.S. dollars, an appreciating U.S. dollar may create opportunities to invest at more attractive U.S. dollar prices in certain countries outside of the United States, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. For our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the depreciation in such currencies will generally contribute to the decrease in the valuation of such investments, to the extent unhedged, and adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial revenues denominated in such currencies, while the appreciation in such currencies would be expected to have the opposite effect. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the euro rose 8.9%, the British pound rose 3.1%, the Japanese yen rose 5.2%, and the Chinese renminbi rose 6.7%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk—Exchange Rate Risk.""Commodity Markets. Our Private Markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other Private Markets and Public Markets strategies and products, including private equity, direct lending, special situations and CLOs, also have meaningful investments in the energy sector. The value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil decreased approximately 12%, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased approximately 2%. The 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil decreased from approximately $52 per barrel to $46 per barrel, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased from approximately $2.42 per mcf to $2.47 per mcf as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. When commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted, to the extent unhedged. In addition, because we hold certain energy real asset investments, which had a fair value of $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 on our balance sheet, these price movements would have an amplified impact on our financial results, to the extent unhedged, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses. For additional information regarding our energy real assets, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies—Real Asset Investments"" and see also ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly.""Following significant volatility in the first half of 2020, due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices remained relatively stable during the third quarter and saw a meaningful uptick in the fourth quarter, although prices ended the year lower than pre-COVID-19 levels. If demand stays depressed, we expect significant volatility in oil prices to continue. While the impact to longer-term prices of crude oil and natural gas has been less pronounced, we expect downward price movements to have a negative impact on the fair value of our energy portfolio, all other things being equal, given those commodity prices are an input in our valuation models. However, we expect the impact of the decline will be mitigated by the existence of our near-127Table of Contentsterm commodity price hedges, which make long-term oil and natural gas prices a more significant driver of the valuation of our energy investments than spot prices. As of December 31, 2020, energy strategies make up approximately 1% of our assets under management, 3% of our total GAAP assets and 3% of our book assets. Business Conditions Our operating revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments at a profit.Our ability to attract new capital and investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. Since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as real assets, credit, core, impact and, through hedge fund partnerships, hedge funds. In several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. We have also reached out to new fund investors, including retail and high net worth investors. However, fundraising continues to be competitive. While our Asian Fund IV, Americas Fund XII, European Fund V, Real Estate Partners Americas II, Global Infrastructure Investors III and Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II exceeded the size of their respective predecessor funds, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship private equity funds or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. If we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our AUM, FPAUM, and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business.""Our ability to successfully deploy capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments that have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our Capital Markets business line, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. Our ability to realize investments. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and result in lower-than-expected returns. Although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, the strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically, affect the valuation of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. When financing is not available or becomes too costly, it may be more difficult to find a buyer that can successfully raise sufficient capital to purchase our investments. Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of KKR Group Partnership and their consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds and certain other entities including certain CLOs and CMBS. We refer to CLOs and CMBS as collateralized financing entities (""CFEs"").When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's stockholders' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. 128Table of Contents For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."" Key Financial Measures Under GAAP The following discussion of key financial measures under GAAP is based on KKR's business as of December 31, 2020 and does not include the effects of the Global Atlantic acquisition, which was completed on February 1, 2021.RevenuesFees and Other Fees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; (v) revenue earned by oil and gas entities that are consolidated; and (vi) consulting fees. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby KKR serves as general partner and includes income or loss from KKR's capital interest as well as ""carried interest"" which entitles KKR to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from investment funds' limited partners. For a further discussion of our revenue policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.ExpensesCompensation and BenefitsCompensation and Benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation, and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.To supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary by individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. We accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income and other factors determined during the year. Beginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of distributable revenues. Based on the current components and blend of our distributable revenues on an annual basis, we expect to use approximately 20‐25% of fee revenues, 60‐70% of realized carried interest and 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees to pay our employees. Because these ranges are applied to applicable distributable revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total distributable revenues will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. We decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determines the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. There is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the employees, except in limited circumstances. Assuming we paid (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized gains in our Principal Activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the ranges 129Table of Contentsabove), KKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders’ Equity – Series I and II Preferred, Common Stock as of December 31, 2020 would be reduced by approximately $1.57 per share, compared to $21.15 per share on such date, and our book value as of December 31, 2020 would be reduced by approximately $1.67 per adjusted share, compared to book value of $ 23.09 per adjusted share on such date. Carry Pool AllocationWith respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to a carry pool established at KKR Associates Holdings L.P., from which our employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. The allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between KKR Associates Holdings L.P. and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and are recorded as compensation expense. Upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. Accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.In February 2021, upon receipt of approval from a committee representing a majority of our independent directors, we amended the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool to 65% for recently formed funds and future funds, while for older funds, it remains 40% or 43%, as applicable. To account for the difference in the carry pool allocation percentages, we expect to use a portion of realized carried interest from the older funds equal to the difference between 65% and 40% or 43%, as applicable, to supplement the carry pool and to pay amounts as discretionary cash bonus compensation as described above to our employees. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus at all for certain employees. The percentage of carried interest allocable to the carry pool may be increased above 65% only with the approval of a majority of our independent directors. See ""—Fair Value Measurements—Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of Operations"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Financial Measures Under GAAP—Expenses—Compensation and Benefits."" Equity-based CompensationIn addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under the Equity Incentive Plans most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant and in certain cases vesting is subject to the achievement of market conditions. Certain of these awards are subject to transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, expenses incurred by oil and gas entities, CLOs and investment funds that are consolidated, costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions (""broken-deal expenses""), expense reimbursements, placement fees and other general operating expenses. A portion of these general administrative and other expenses, in particular broken-deal expenses, are borne by fund investors.Investment Income (Loss)Net Gains (Losses) from Investment ActivitiesNet gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements.""130Table of ContentsDividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that we and our consolidated investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which we and our consolidated investment funds invest. Dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of cash generated from operations from portfolio investments, and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio investments.Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our credit instruments in which we and our consolidated investment funds, CLOs and other entities invest as well as interest on our cash and other investments. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from debt issued by KKR, including debt issued by KFN, credit facilities entered into by KKR, debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs, and financing arrangements at our consolidated investment funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN. Debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs are supported solely by the investments held at the CFE and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. However, in some circumstances, we may provide limited guarantees of the obligations of our general partners in an amount equal to its pro rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. We also may provide other kinds of guarantees. See ""—Liquidity.""Income TaxesKKR & Co. Inc. is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thus is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level on KKR’s share of net taxable income. In addition, KKR Group Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. These entities, in some cases, are subject to U.S. state or local income taxes or non-U.S. income taxes. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.For a further discussion of our income tax policies, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" and Note 11 ""Income Taxes.""Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership held by KKR Holdings, we expect a portion of net income (loss) will continue to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in our business.For a further discussion of our noncontrolling interests policies, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15 ""Equity.""131Table of ContentsKey Non-GAAP and Other Operating and Performance MeasuresThe following discussion of key Non-GAAP and other operating and performance measures under GAAP is based on KKR's business as of December 31, 2020 and does not include the effects of the Global Atlantic acquisition, which was completed on February 1, 2021.The key non-GAAP and other operating and performance measures that follow are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures, including after-tax distributable earnings, distributable revenues, distributable expenses, distributable operating earnings, fee related earnings, book assets, book liabilities, book value and book value per adjusted shares, are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. Inc. and KKR Holdings L.P. and as such represent the business in total. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and CFEs that KKR manages as well as one or more other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of KKR & Co. Inc.We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution readers that these non-GAAP measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included under ""—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures."" Adjusted SharesAdjusted shares represents shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. outstanding under GAAP adjusted to include shares issuable upon exchange of all units of KKR Holdings L.P. and KKR Holdings II L.P. and the number of assumed shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. We believe providing adjusted shares is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the calculation of amounts available for distribution as dividends on a per adjusted share basis assuming all units of KKR Holdings L.P. and KKR Holdings II L.P. and all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are exchanged and converted, respectively, to shares of common stock. Weighted average adjusted shares is used in the calculation of after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share and adjusted shares is used in the calculation of book value per adjusted share.After-tax Distributable EarningsAfter-tax distributable earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure of KKR’s earnings after interest expense, Series A and B preferred dividends, noncontrolling interests and income taxes paid. After -tax distributable earnings excludes mark-to-market gains (losses) and is used by management to assess the net realized earnings of KKR for a given reporting period, after deducting equity-based compensation under the Equity Incentive Plans and adjusting to exclude the impact of strategic corporate transaction-related charges and non-recurring items, if any. KKR believes that after-tax distributable earnings is useful to stockholders as it aligns KKR’s net realization performance with the manner in which KKR receives its revenues and determines the compensation of its employees. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends have been excluded from after-tax distributable earnings because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock. After-tax distributable earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR’s dividend policy. Equity-based compensation expense is included in after-tax distributable earnings as a component of compensation expense in order to reflect the dilutive nature of these non-cash equity-based awards. Income taxes paid represents the implied amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax distributable earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which would occur following an exchange of all KKR Holdings units for common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Income taxes paid also includes amounts paid pursuant to the tax receivable agreement.132Table of ContentsAssets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets managed or advised by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest (either currently or upon deployment of capital), general partner capital, and assets managed or advised by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or carried interest; (iii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs (excluding CLOs wholly-owned by KKR); (v) KKR's pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all AUM of the strategic BDC partnership with FS Investments; and (vii) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Book Assets Book assets is a non-GAAP performance measure that represents cash and short-term investments, investments, net unrealized carried interest, tax assets, and other assets of KKR presented on a basis that deconsolidates (i) KKR's investment funds and collateralized financing entities that KKR manages and (ii) other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of KKR & Co. Inc. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the assets of KKR that are used to operate its business lines. As used in this definition, cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield.Book Liabilities Book liabilities is a non-GAAP performance measure that represents the debt obligations of KKR (including KFN), tax liabilities, and other liabilities of KKR presented on a basis that deconsolidates (i) KKR's investment funds and collateralized financing entities that KKR manages and (ii) other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of KKR & Co. Inc. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the liabilities of KKR excluding the liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders and to the holders of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.Book Value Book value is a non-GAAP performance measure of the net assets of KKR and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR’s book assets after deducting for book liabilities, noncontrolling interests and Series A and B Preferred Stock. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the net assets of KKR excluding those net assets that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders and to the holders of the Series A and B Preferred Stock. KKR's book value includes the net impact of KKR's tax assets and liabilities as prepared under GAAP. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been included in book value, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock.Capital Invested Capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment funds, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested. See also syndicated capital. 133Table of ContentsDistributable Revenues Distributable revenues is a non-GAAP performance measure that represents the realized revenues (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized net gains (losses)) generated by KKR and is the sum of (i) fees and other, net, (ii) realized performance income (loss) and (iii) realized investment income (loss). KKR believes that distributable revenues is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the realized revenue generated by KKR's business lines.Distributable Expenses Distributable expenses is a non-GAAP performance measure that represents the expenses of KKR and is the sum of (i) compensation and benefits (excluding unrealized performance income compensation), (ii) occupancy and related charges and (iii) other operating expenses. KKR believes that distributable expenses is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the costs expended in connection with generating KKR's distributable revenues. Distributable Operating Earnings Distributable operating earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure that represents after-tax distributable earnings before interest expense, Series A and B preferred dividends, income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and income taxes paid. We believe distributable operating earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that we do not believe relate directly to KKR's operations.Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only carried interest or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"")Fee related earnings is a non-GAAP supplemental performance measure of earnings of KKR before performance income and investment income. KKR believes this measure may be useful to stockholders as it may provide additional insight into the profitability of KKR’s fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. Fee related earnings is calculated as KKR’s total Fees and Other, Net, multiplied by KKR’s distributable operating margin. For purposes of the fee related earnings calculation, distributable operating margin is calculated as distributable operating earnings, before equity-based compensation, divided by total distributable revenues.Syndicated Capital Syndicated capital is the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by KKR and its investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties, generally in exchange for a fee. It does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in capital invested, (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by KKR investment funds, and (iii) debt capital that is either underwritten or arranged on a best efforts basis. Syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets business line and across KKR's investment platform.134Table of ContentsUncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.135Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III as it entered its post investment period in the third quarter of 2020, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and pays fees at a lower rate and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from European Fund IV as it entered its post investment period in the second quarter of 2019, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than remaining commitments and capital invested during the investment period.Transaction fees increased overall primarily from a higher level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in transaction fees earned in our Private Markets business line, and to a lesser extent, our Public Markets business line. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Operating Results—Distributable Revenues."" Fee credits decreased compared to the prior period as a result of a lower level of transaction fees in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. Transaction fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower carried interest allocations from 2006 Fund and Asia Fund II. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in carried interest allocations from Americas Fund XII and Global Infrastructure Investors II. 137Table of ContentsKKR generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments. Additionally, unrealized carried interest and general partner capital interest reverse upon a realization, and unrealized carried interest and general partner capital interest can be negative if the amount of realized carried interest exceeds total carried interest generated in the period. Compensation and Benefits Expenses The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of cash compensation resulting from a higher level of fees earned and (ii) a higher level of equity-based compensation resulting from certain equity awards that were granted in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which a portion vested immediately. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in carried interest compensation resulting from a lower level of carried interest generated in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period. General, Administrative and Other Expenses The decrease in general, administrative and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a decrease in capital raising costs and (ii) a decrease in corporate travel-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partially offsetting these decreases were corporate transaction-related charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of Global Atlantic.

These decreases were partially offset by (i) the impact of closing additional consolidated CLOs subsequent to December 31, 2019 and (ii) an increase in interest income from certain of our consolidated direct lending funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed.

For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Operating Results—Distributable Expenses—Interest Expense.""Income (Loss) Before Taxes The increase in income before taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due primarily to (i) a higher level of total investment income and (ii) a higher level of management fees.

These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III as it entered its post-investment period in the third quarter of 2020, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and pays fees at a lower rate, and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from European Fund IV as it entered its post investment period in the second quarter of 2019, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than remaining commitments and capital invested during the investment period.The increase in monitoring fees was primarily attributable to an increase in recurring monitoring fees compared to the prior period, as well as higher termination payments. Recurring monitoring fees increased $10.5 million, which was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying monitoring fees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had 66 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.7 million compared with 59 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received termination payments of $13.2 million in connection with the IPOs of Academy Sports & Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASO) and Calisen PLC (LSE: CLSN LN) compared to $2.1 million of termination payments received in the year ended December 31, 2019 relating to the IPO of Trainline PLC. These termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with the IPO and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio. 144Table of ContentsThe decrease in transaction fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average size of transaction fee generating investments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.2 million compared to 59 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 36% of these transaction fees were paid by companies in North America, 34% were paid from companies in Europe, and 30% were paid by companies located in the Asia-Pacific region. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular agreements as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. Additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. Realized Performance Income (Loss)The following table presents realized carried interest by investment vehicle for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, 2020December 31, 2019 ($ in thousands)North America Fund XI$203,606 $341,602 2006 Fund181,899 143,692 Global Infrastructure Investors II148,882 — European Fund IV139,948 221,222 Co-Investment Vehicles and Other93,650 70,179 Asian Fund II60,647 126,039 Core Investment Vehicles57,484 14,449 Global Infrastructure Investors54,729 — Asian Fund III46,347 36,707 Next Generation Technology Growth Fund13,964 — Real Estate Partners Americas4,977 7,439 Asian Fund 431 10,913 European Fund III— 65,700 European Fund II— 5,058 China Growth Fund— 3,038 Total Realized Carried Interest (1)$1,006,564 $1,046,038 (1)The above table excludes any funds for which there was no realized carried interest during both of the periods presented. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales Deutsche Glasfaser (telecom sector), Privilege Underwriters, Inc. (financial services sector), LGC Science Group Limited (health care sector), Epicor Software Corporation, The Hut Group Limited and the partial sales of our investment in Fiserv, Inc. Realized carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales of Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc. and Trainline PLC and dividends received from our investment in Fiserv, Inc.Incentive fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to fees earned from certain separately managed accounts relating to investments in our private equity, core, and infrastructure strategies.145Table of ContentsPublic Markets The following table presents Fees and Other, Net and Realized Performance Income (Loss) in the Public Markets business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Fees and Other, NetManagement Fees$459,323 $446,982 $12,341 Transaction Fees 69,792 79,383 (9,591)Fee Credits(66,211)(75,224)9,013 Total Fees and Other, Net$462,904 $451,141 $11,763 Realized Performance Income (Loss)Carried Interest$35,640 $24,750 $10,890 Incentive Fees148,952 62,940 86,012 Total Realized Performance Income (Loss)$184,592 $87,690 $96,902 Fees and Other, NetThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in management fees, partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees, net of associated fee credits.The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from new capital raised within the leveraged credit strategy, the issuance of new CLOs and greater overall FPAUM at our direct lending and private opportunistic credit strategies, partially offset by a lower level of management fees earned in certain alternative credit strategies, most notably special situations.The decrease in transaction fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in both the number and average size of transaction fee-generating investments during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 42 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $1.7 million compared to 45 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular agreements as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction, and KKR's role in the transaction. The decrease in fee credits is due primarily to a lower level of transaction fees.Realized Performance Income (Loss)The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to (i) a higher level of incentive fees earned from our hedge fund partnership, Marshall Wace, and (ii) an increased level of realized carried interest earned in certain of our alternative credit funds, partially offset by a lower level of incentive fees earned from BDCs advised by FS/KKR Advisor.Capital Markets The following table presents Transaction Fees in the Capital Markets business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Transaction Fees$480,483 $410,055 $70,428 146Table of Contents The increase in transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the size of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Overall, we completed 193 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which 36 represented equity offerings and 157 represented debt offerings, as compared to 192 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which 28 represented equity offerings and 164 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 18% of our transaction fees were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 58% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 61% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate management or monitoring fees.Principal Activities The following table presents Realized Investment Income (Loss) in the Principal Activities business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Realized Investment Income (Loss)Net Realized Gains (Losses)$284,521 $189,858 $94,663 Interest Income and Dividends 360,138 495,915 (135,777)Total Realized Investment Income (Loss)$644,659 $685,773 $(41,114)Realized Investment Income (Loss) The decrease in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in interest income and dividends, partially offset by a higher level of net realized gains. The amount of realized investment income (loss) depends on the transaction activity of our funds and balance sheet, which can vary from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $225.4 million of dividend income from our investment in Fiserv, Inc. ($62.5 million) and Epicor Software Corporation ($27.3 million) as well as distributions received primarily through our real assets investments, including our real estate investment in KREF and (ii) $134.7 million of interest income from our investments in CLOs, investments held at our Capital Markets business line, and to a lesser extent our cash balances. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $195.3 million of dividend income from our investment in Fiserv, Inc., (ii) $141.4 million of dividend income from distributions received primarily through our real assets investments, including our real estate investment in KREF and our energy investments, as well as certain of our credit and private equity investments, and (iii) $159.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our Public Markets investments, including CLOs and other credit investments, our cash balances, and, to a lesser extent, our Capital Markets business. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net realized gains were comprised of realized gains primarily from the sale of our investments in The Hut Group Limited, Deutsche Glasfaser, and Ivalua SAS, and the partial sales in our investments in Fiserv, Inc. and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses on our investment in LCI Helicopters Limited, Yorktown Center (real estate) and various alternative credit strategy investments.147Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2019, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of our investments in Trainline PLC, GEG German Estate Group AG (financial services sector), and Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., and the sale of certain investments in our special situations funds. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which was a realized loss on the sale of our investment in DoubleDutch, Inc.Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we completed, or signed and expect to complete, sales, partial sales or secondary sales with respect to certain private equity portfolio companies and other investments that, if and when completed, are expected to result in realized performance income and realized investment income in excess of $375 million. Some of these transactions are not complete, and are subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including but not limited to regulatory approvals; there can be no assurance if or when any of these transactions will be completed. On January 1, 2020, KKR Capstone was acquired by KKR and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR. For GAAP purposes, KKR Capstone was consolidated prior to January 1, 2020 and as such the fees and expenses attributable to KKR Capstone were included in KKR's consolidated revenues and expenses. Additionally, prior to January 1, 2020, KKR excluded the results of KKR Capstone from KKR's non-GAAP financial measures since KKR presents these financial measures prior to giving effect to the consolidation of certain entities that are not legal subsidiaries of KKR. Following the KKR Capstone acquisition, KKR's after-tax distributable earnings includes the net income (loss) from KKR Capstone within realized investment income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2020, total fees attributable to KKR Capstone were $81.5 million and total expenses attributable to KKR Capstone were $65.7 million. For KKR Capstone-related adjustments in reconciling distributable revenues and distributable expenses to GAAP revenues and expenses, respectively, see ""—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures.""Distributable ExpensesCompensation and Benefits The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period is primarily due to higher compensation expense recorded in connection with the higher level of distributable revenues. Equity-based compensation charges were higher compared to the prior period primarily resulting from certain equity awards that were granted in the fourth quarter of 2020, which vested immediately.Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a lower level of expenses that are not creditable to our investment funds, in particular a decrease in travel related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by a higher level of professional fees and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm. Other Components of After-tax Distributable EarningsInterest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest expense relates primarily to the senior notes outstanding for KKR and KFN. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period is due primarily to the following new issuances during the year ended December 31, 2020: (i) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2050, (ii) $250 million aggregate principal amount of $3.750% Senior Notes due 2029 and (iii) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2050. This increase was partially offset by the redemption of our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 in the third quarter of 2019.Income Taxes Paid The increase in income taxes paid is primarily due to a higher level of total distributable operating earnings.148Table of ContentsAfter-tax Distributable Earnings The increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was due primarily to a higher level of distributable revenues, partially offset by an increase in distributable expenses, interest expense and income taxes paid.Other Operating and Performance MeasuresThe following table presents certain key operating and performance metrics as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:As ofDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Assets Under Management$251,679,200 $218,355,100 $33,324,100 Fee Paying Assets Under Management$186,217,000 $161,209,800 $25,007,200 Uncalled Commitments$66,960,000 $56,920,600 $10,039,400 The following table presents one of our key performance metrics for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Capital Invested and Syndicated Capital$34,541,900 $28,055,900 $6,486,000 Assets Under ManagementPrivate MarketsThe following table reflects the changes in our Private Markets AUM from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020: ($ in thousands)December 31, 2019$119,274,700 New Capital Raised28,040,000 Distributions and Other(12,677,300)Change in Value14,051,900 December 31, 2020$148,689,300 AUM for the Private Markets business line was $148.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $29.4 billion, compared to $119.3 billion at December 31, 2019.The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised primarily in Asian Fund IV, Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors, Property Partners America, Real Estate Partners Americas III, Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, core investment accounts, and Asia Real Estate Partners, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of our Private Markets portfolio. These increases were partially offset by distributions to Private Markets fund investors primarily as a result of realizations, most notably in North America Fund XI, Global Infrastructure Investors II, 2006 Fund, European Fund IV, Asian Fund II, and Global Infrastructure Investors.The increase in the value of our Private Markets portfolio was driven primarily by net gains of $4.4 billion in Americas Fund XII, $1.9 billion in Asian Fund III, $1.4 billion in our core investment accounts, $1.3 billion in North America Fund XI, and $1.2 billion in Global Infrastructure Investors II. These net gains were partially offset by net losses of $0.4 billion in Asia Fund II.For the year ended December 31, 2020, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 17.1%. This was comprised of a 20.7% increase in value of our privately held investments and a 6.4% increase in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments. See ""—Business Environment"" for more details on the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.149Table of ContentsThe most significant increases in value of our privately held investments related to increases in AppLovin Corporation (technology sector), Kokusai Electric Corporation (manufacturing sector), and Internet Brands, Inc. (technology sector). These increases in value on our privately held investments were partially offset by decreases in value relating primarily to Envision Healthcare Corporation (health care sector), Magneti Marelli (industrial sector), and Emerald Media (media sector). The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and with respect to Kokusai Electric Corporation, an increase in valuation reflecting an agreement to exit the investment. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables, both influenced by the impact of COVID-19 on the economic outlook and overall market environment. The most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were increases in Academy Sports & Outdoor Inc., Hensoldt AG (FRA: HAG), and Max Healthcare Institute Limited (NSE: MAXHEALTH). These increases were partially offset by decreases in share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Fiserv, Inc., Laureate Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: LAUR) and BrightView Holdings Inc.For the year ended December 31, 2019, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 27.0%. This was comprised of a 60.7% increase in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 16.7% increase in value of our privately held investments.The most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were increases in Fiserv, Inc., Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc.(renamed Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE: IR) in connection with the merger transaction with Ingersoll Rand Inc.), and BrightView Holdings Inc. (NYSE: BV). These increases were partially offset by decreases in share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were decreases in Coffee Day Resorts Private Limited (NSE: CCD), RigNet, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNET), and Tarena International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TEDU). The most significant increases in value of our privately held investments related to increases in KCF Technologies Co. Ltd. (industrial sector), Kokusai Electric Corporation, AppLovin Corporation, and Internet Brands, Inc. These increases in value on our privately held investments were partially offset by decreases in value relating primarily to oil and gas assets held in our energy income and growth portfolio, Envision Healthcare Corporation, and Academy Sports & Outdoor Inc. The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables, and (iii) with respect to KCF Technologies Co. Ltd. and Kokusai Electric Corporation, increases in valuation reflecting agreements to exit these investments. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.Public MarketsThe following table reflects the changes in our Public Markets AUM from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020: ($ in thousands)December 31, 2019$99,080,400 New Capital Raised15,750,300 Distributions and Other(3,561,000)Redemptions(11,047,500)Change in Value2,767,700 December 31, 2020$102,989,900 AUM in our Public Markets business line totaled $103.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.9 billion compared to AUM of $99.1 billion at December 31, 2019.The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised related to multiple strategies, most notably $4.5 billion in alternative credit strategies most notably $2.2 billion in our KKR Dislocation Opportunities Fund, $3.9 billion in our hedge fund partnerships, $3.6 billion in leveraged credit strategies, and $2.2 billion in CLOs. Partially offsetting this increase was redemptions and distributions from our hedge fund partnerships and our alternative and leveraged credit strategies.

See ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Operating Results—Other Operating and Performance Measures—Assets Under Management—Private Markets"" for a detailed discussion on new capital raised for the year ended December 31, 2020.Public MarketsAs of December 31, 2020, our Public Markets business line had $10.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised in various alternative credit strategies, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.Capital Invested and Syndicated CapitalPrivate Markets Capital Invested For the year ended December 31, 2020, Private Markets had $19.2 billion of capital invested as compared to $14.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by a $4.3 billion increase in capital invested in our private equity strategies (including core, growth equity, and impact investments) and a $0.8 billion increase in capital invested in our real assets strategies. Generally, the portfolio companies acquired through our private equity funds have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets funds. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 38% of capital deployed in private equity, which includes core, growth equity and impact investments, was in transactions in Europe, 35% was in North America, and 27% was in the Asia-Pacific region.Public Markets Capital Invested For the year ended December 31, 2020, Public Markets had $10.3 billion of capital invested as compared to $10.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to capital deployed in our dislocation opportunities strategy, partially offset by a lower level of capital deployed in our direct lending credit strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 67% of capital deployed was in transactions in North America, 31% was in Europe, and 2% was in the Asia-Pacific region.Capital Markets Syndicated CapitalFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Capital Markets syndicated $5.0 billion of capital as compared to $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of syndication transactions in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Overall, we completed 24 syndication transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 21 syndications for the year ended December 31, 2019. The size and frequency of syndication transactions depend in large part on market conditions and other factors that are unpredictable and outside our control, which may negatively impact the fees generated by our capital markets business from syndication transactions.152Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Balance Sheet MeasuresThe following tables present information with respect to our book assets, book liabilities, and book value as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:BOOK ASSETSAs of December 31, 2020December 31, 2019 ($ in thousands)Book AssetsCash and Short-term Investments$5,961,083 $2,783,905 Investments14,991,914 13,026,387 Net Unrealized Carried Interest (1)2,625,935 1,982,251 Tax Assets43,446 111,719 Other Assets (2)4,198,641 3,716,189 Total Book Assets $27,821,019 $21,620,451 BOOK LIABILITIESAs ofDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019($ in thousands)Book LiabilitiesDebt Obligations - KKR (ex-KFN) $4,688,460 $3,097,460 Debt Obligations - KFN948,517 948,517 Tax Liabilities529,412 169,997 Other Liabilities857,764 514,236 Total Book Liabilities $7,024,153 $4,730,210 BOOK VALUEAs ofDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019($ in thousands)Book Value(+) Total Book Assets$27,821,019 $21,620,451 (-) Total Book Liabilities7,024,153 4,730,210 (-) Noncontrolling Interests29,510 26,291 (-) Series A and B Preferred Stock500,000 500,000 Book Value $20,267,356 $16,363,950 Book Value Per Adjusted Share $23.09 $19.24 Adjusted Shares (3)877,613,164 850,388,924 (1)The following table provides net unrealized carried interest by business line:As ofDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019($ in thousands)Private Markets Business Line$2,560,101 $1,832,581 Public Markets Business Line65,834 149,670 Total$2,625,935 $1,982,251 (2)Other Assets include KKR's ownership interest in FS/KKR Advisor and minority ownership interests in hedge fund partnerships.(3)Includes shares of KKR & Co. Inc. common stock assuming conversion of all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2020.Book Value Per Adjusted ShareBook value per adjusted share increased 20% from December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) the net appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio, including investments held by KKR as well as investments held 153Table of Contentsthrough investment funds, such as KKR's private equity, real assets and alternative credit funds, where KKR is entitled to earn carried interest and (ii) after-tax distributable earnings during the period. Partially offsetting this increase is the payment of dividends during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the value of KKR's balance sheet portfolio, on a non-GAAP basis, increased 18% and KKR's overall private equity portfolio increased 17%. The increases in KKR's balance sheet portfolio and net unrealized carried interest was primarily due to mark-to-market net gains in our portfolio companies.

To the extent investments in our book assets are realized at values below their cost in future periods, after-tax distributable earnings would be adversely affected by the amount of such loss, if any, during the period in which the realization event occurs. For example, we have recognized certain net unrealized losses in our credit investment portfolio held at our India debt finance company, of which we own 50.3% of its equity. As of December 31, 2020, KKR’s 50.3% interest in our India debt finance company had a cost basis of approximately $184 million, comprised of invested capital of $100 million plus reinvested earnings. If the value of our investment is ultimately realized at the current carrying value of $70 million, future realized investment losses of approximately $114 million would be recognized based on valuations as of December 31, 2020, which would reduce after-tax distributable earnings in future periods.As of December 31, 2020($ in thousands)Investments (1)CostFair ValueFair Value as a Percentage ofTotal InvestmentsPrivate Equity Funds / SMAs$3,949,771 $6,445,077 43.0 %Private Equity Co-Investments and Other Equity1,476,638 3,719,477 24.8 %Private Equity Total5,426,409 10,164,554 67.8 %Energy781,622 724,848 4.8 %Real Estate1,247,835 1,324,660 8.8 %Infrastructure362,278 428,878 2.9 %Real Assets Total2,391,735 2,478,386 16.5 %Alternative Credit780,097 689,068 4.6 %CLOs866,140 798,279 5.3 %Other Credit151,200 161,187 1.1 %Credit Total1,797,437 1,648,534 11.0 %Other1,012,207 700,440 4.7 %Total Investments$10,627,788 $14,991,914 100.0 %December 31, 2020($ in thousands)Significant Investments: (2)CostFair ValueFair Value as a Percentage ofTotal InvestmentsFiserv, Inc.

See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 ""Equity Based Compensation.""Liquidity We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and CFEs and the effect of changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. Our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and CLOs; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes, and other borrowing arrangements. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Dividends.""See ""—Business Environment"" for more details on the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.158Table of ContentsSources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLOs; (iv) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments for fund formations; and (v) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings, and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our equity securities. Many of our investment funds provide carried interest. With respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2020, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. Strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Strategic investor partnerships have longer investment periods and invest in multiple strategies, which may increase the possibility of a 'netting hole,' which will result in less carried interest for us, as well as clawback liabilities."" As of December 31, 2020, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at two of our private equity funds, which were Americas Fund XII of $524 million and Asian Fund II of $346 million. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future.We have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. The following describes these sources of liquidity.Revolving Credit Agreements, Senior Notes, KFN Debt Obligation, KFN Securities and Real Estate FinancingFor a discussion of KKR's debt obligations, including our revolving credit agreements, senior notes, KFN debt obligations, KFN securities and corporate real estate financing, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10 ""Debt Obligations."" Liquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:•continue to support and grow our business lines, including seeding new strategies, funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies, pay the costs related to fundraising and launching of new strategies, and otherwise supporting investment vehicles which we sponsor; 159Table of Contents•warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, vehicles, accounts or CLOs pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;•service debt obligations including the payment of obligations upon maturity or redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;•fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including litigation matters; •pay corporate income taxes and other taxes;•pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings; •pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock; •underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;•support and acquire other assets for our Principal Activities business line, including other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for CLOs (to the extent it continues to apply); and •repurchase KKR's common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or other securities issued by KKR.For a discussion of KKR's share repurchase program, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15 ""Equity—Share Repurchase Program.""Our liquidity needs also included the funding of the acquisition of Global Atlantic, which was completed on February 1, 2021, for which we used $2.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet. In addition, with respect to Global Atlantic's business, their overall liquidity framework and cash management approach is based on: (1) building an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from their assets to meet their expected cash outflows in their base case to pay their liabilities, and (2) maintaining access to sufficient liquidity through other sources to meet their needs under scenarios that differ from their base case. Global Atlantic’s primary sources of liquidity, outside of the inflows from their investment portfolio, generally include: cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions, funding agreements, including through memberships in Federal Home Loan Banks, advances under their revolving credit facility, committed repurchase agreements, uncommitted financing, such as repurchase agreements, which are accessible in normal market environments, and the sale of assets within their investment portfolio. Global Atlantic’s uses of liquidity generally include payments to policyholders, payments related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance or funding agreement activity, interest expense, collateral posted or returned in respect of their derivative contracts, and operating expenses. 160Table of ContentsCapital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy our balance sheet is pursuing.

As of December 31, 2020, these commitments amounted to $232.0 million and $578.8 million, respectively. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. Our capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which reduce our risk when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2020 have been reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third parties. In the case of purchases of 161Table of Contentsinvestments or assets in our Principal Activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less than shown.On January 14, 2020, KKR committed to invest up to an additional $150 million in our India debt finance company to support its alternative credit business in India. As of December 31, 2020, none of the $150 million commitment has been invested. Tax Receivable AgreementWe may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings, which may result in an increase in our tax basis of the assets of KKR Group Partnership at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires us to pay to KKR Holdings, or to current and former limited partners who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR's common stock as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. As of December 31, 2020, an undiscounted payable of $204.0 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $43.0 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement.DividendsA dividend of $0.135 per share of our common stock has been declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, which will be paid on March 9, 2021 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on February 22, 2021.

Our current dividend policy is to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.58 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.145 per share) beginning with any dividend to be announced with respect to the results for the first quarter of 2021, subject to the discretion of our board of directors based on a number of factors, including KKR’s future financial performance and other considerations that the board deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of KKR & Co. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for U.S. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. Furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by KKR Group Partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the terms of the preferred units of KKR Group Partnership.Preferred StockFor a discussion of KKR's equity, including our preferred stock, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15 ""Equity."" Other Liquidity NeedsFrom time to time, we fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the arranging or underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, for which we may draw all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under both the KCM Short-Term Credit Agreement and KCM Credit 162Table of ContentsAgreement. We generally expect these borrowings to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment.Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and CFEs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2020 excluding consolidated funds and CFEs with a reconciliation of such amounts to the anticipated future cash payments of KKR including consolidated funds and CFEs.

See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement"" in this report and ""Risk Factors—We will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from prior and future exchanges of our common stock for KKR Group Partnership Units and related transactions, and the timing and value of these tax attributes differ from those of our restricted stock units."" We may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. We enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and covenants, including indemnifications. For example, certain of our investment funds and KFN have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. KKR has also provided certain guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct, bankruptcy and other customary wrongful acts in connection with the financing of KKR's corporate real estate and certain investment vehicles. KKR has also (i) provided credit support regarding repayment and funding obligations to third-party lenders to certain of its employees, excluding its executive officers, in connection with their personal investments in KKR investment funds and a structured investment vehicle and (ii) provided credit support to one of our hedge fund partnerships. We have also indemnified employees and non-employees against potential liabilities, in connection with their service as described under ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others."" In addition, we have also provided credit support to certain of our subsidiaries' obligations in connection with certain investment vehicles or partnerships that we manage. For example, KKR has guaranteed the obligations of a general partner to post collateral on behalf of its investment vehicle in connection with such vehicle's derivative transactions, and we have also agreed to be liable for certain investment losses and/or for providing liquidity in the events specified in the governing documents of certain investment vehicles. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is currently unknown as our liabilities for these matters would require a claim to be made against us in the future. The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16 ""Commitments and Contingencies—Contingent Repayment Guarantees"" for further information on KKR's potential clawback obligations.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.164Table of ContentsCritical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. The following discusses certain aspects of our critical accounting policies. For a full discussion of these and all critical accounting policies, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."" Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Except for certain of KKR's equity method investments and debt obligations, KKR's investments and other financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value.GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Investments and financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:Level IPricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. The types of financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and securities sold short.We classified 6.1% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level I at December 31, 2020.Level IIPricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. The types of financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, investments and debt obligations of consolidated CLO entities, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives such as foreign currency option and forward contracts.We classified 37.6% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2020.Level IIIPricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The types of financial instruments generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments, credit investments, equity method investments for which the fair value option was elected and investments and debt obligations of consolidated CMBS entities.We classified 56.3% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2020. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2020 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.165Table of Contents Level III Valuation MethodologiesWith respect to our private equity portfolio, which includes growth equity investments, we generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of an investment. The first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. In certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. Other inputs are also used in both methodologies. Also, as discussed in greater detail under ""—Business Environment"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition"" in this report, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. In addition, when a definitive agreement has been executed to sell an investment, KKR generally considers a significant determinant of fair value to be the consideration to be received by KKR pursuant to the executed definitive agreement.Upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies, except that the value may be higher or lower than such range in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement.Across the total Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 60% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of this Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2020, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III private equity investments were 39%, 54%, and 7%, respectively. In the case of growth equity investments, enterprise values may be determined using the market comparables analysis and discounted cash flow analysis described above. A scenario analysis may also be conducted to subject the estimated enterprise values to a downside, base and upside case, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. A milestone analysis may also be conducted to assess the current level of progress towards value drivers that we have determined to be important, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. The enterprise value in each case may then be allocated across the investment's capital structure to reflect the terms of the security and subjected to probability weightings. In certain cases, the values of growth equity investments may be based on recent or expected financings.Real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Infrastructure investments are generally valued using the discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in this methodology can include the weighted average cost of capital and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Energy investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in this methodology that require estimates include the weighted average cost of capital. In addition, the valuations of energy investments generally incorporate both commodity prices as quoted on indices and long-term commodity price forecasts, which may be substantially different from, and are currently higher than, commodity prices on certain indices for equivalent future dates. Certain energy investments do not include an illiquidity discount. Long-term commodity price forecasts are utilized to capture the value of the investments across a range of commodity prices within the energy investment portfolio associated with future development and to reflect a range of price expectations. Real estate investments are generally valued using a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs used in such methodologies that require estimates include an unlevered discount rate and current capitalization rate, and certain real estate investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. Certain real estate investments are valued by KKR based on ranges of valuations determined by independent valuation firms. The valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs. For GAAP purposes, where KKR holds energy investments consisting of working interests in oil and gas properties directly and not through an investment fund, such working interests are consolidated based on the proportion of the working interests held by us. Accordingly, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated working interests on a gross basis and changes in the value of these energy investments are not reflected as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, a change in fair value for these 166Table of Contentsinvestments does not result in a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities, but may result in an impairment charge reflected in general, administrative and other expenses. For non-GAAP purposes, these directly held working interests are treated as investments and changes in value are reflected in our operating results as unrealized gains and losses.On a non-GAAP basis, our energy real asset investments in oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2020 had a fair value of approximately $725 million. Based on this fair value, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of these energy investments from one or more adverse movements to the investments' valuation inputs would result in a decline in book value of $72.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, if we were to value our energy investments using only the commodity prices as quoted on indices and did not use long-term commodity price forecasts, and also held all other inputs to their valuation constant, we estimate that book value would have been approximately $45 million lower.These hypothetical declines relate only to book value. There would be no current impact on KKR's unrealized carried interest since all of the investment funds which hold these types of energy investments have investment values that are either below their cost or not currently accruing carried interest. Additionally, there would be no impact on fees since fees earned from investment funds which hold investments in oil and gas properties are based on either committed capital or capital invested.Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are generally valued by us based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.There is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of Level III investments and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, KKR will realize the values reflected in our valuations. Our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. Furthermore, the recent market volatility caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding its full impact have amplified the possibility that our future valuations may materially change from those reflected as of December 31, 2020. See ""—Business Environment"" for more details on the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 ""Fair Value Measurements.""Level III Valuation ProcessThe valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.For Private Markets investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. KKR begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its Level III assets one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and KKR follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its Level III assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. These preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations annually for all Level III investments in Private Markets and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of KKR's Level III Private Markets investments. The valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by an independent valuation firm without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firm relies on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. For credit investments in Public Markets and debt obligations of consolidated CMBS vehicles, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged quarterly by KKR with respect to most investments classified as Level III. The valuation firm either provides a value or provides a valuation range from which KKR's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the preliminary valuation or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness and provide positive assurance of KKR's valuations. After reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by KKR's valuation committees. As of December 31, 2020, less than 4% of the total value of our Level III credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.KKR has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. The global 167Table of Contentsvaluation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core investments), growth equity, real estate, energy and infrastructure and credit. The asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary Level III valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. The members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments.All Level III valuations are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes one of KKR's Co-Presidents/Co-Chief Operating Officers and its Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. When valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and are then reported to the board of directors.As of December 31, 2020, upon completion by, where applicable, an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain investments, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR, of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. There were no changes made to our Level III valuation process as a result of COVID-19.As described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.Changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly and through our consolidated funds as described below. We estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. With respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments.As of December 31, 2020, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, as of December 31, 2020, investments which represented greater than 5% of total non-GAAP investments consisted of Fiserv, Inc., BridgeBio Pharma Inc., and USI, Inc. valued at $1,332.2 million, $974.3 million, and $884.6 million, respectively. Our investment income on a GAAP basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of Fiserv, Inc. and BridgeBio Pharma Inc. See ""—Business Environment"" for a discussion on the impact of global equity markets on our financial condition and ""—Non-GAAP Balance Sheet Measures"" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a non-GAAP basis.Recognition of Investment IncomeInvestment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments; (ii) dividends; (iii) interest income; (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs.Certain of our investment funds are consolidated. When a fund is consolidated, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated statements of operations. For 168Table of Contentsfunds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. However, because certain of our funds remain consolidated and because we hold a minority economic interest in these funds' investments, our share of the investment income is less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated statements of operations for these consolidated funds.Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of OperationsCarried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Carried interest is earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as losses in the statement of operations. For funds that are not consolidated, amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included in capital allocation-based income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest at consolidated funds are eliminated upon consolidation of the fund and are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities along with all of the other investment gains and losses at the consolidated fund.Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition.Prior to 2012, most of our historical private equity funds that provide for carried interest do not have a preferred return. For these funds, the management company is required to refund up to 20% of any management fees earned from its limited partners in the event that the fund recognizes carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability due to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the management fees earned. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investment is sold and the associated carried interest is realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the earned management fees, such management fees would be retained and not returned to the funds' limited partners.Most of our investment funds that provide for carried interest and were launched after 2012, however, have a preferred return. In this case, the management company does not refund the management fees earned from the limited partners of the fund as described above. Instead, the management fee is effectively returned to the limited partners through a reduction of the realized gain on which carried interest is calculated. To calculate the carried interest, KKR calculates whether a preferred return has been achieved based on an amount that includes all of the management fees paid by the limited partners as well as the other capital contributions and expenses paid by them to date. To the extent the fund has exceeded the preferred return at the time of a realization event, and subject to any other conditions for the payment of carried interest like netting holes, carried interest is distributed to the general partner. Until the preferred return is achieved, no carried interest is recorded. Thereafter, the general partner is entitled to a catch up allocation such that the general partner's carried interest is paid in respect of all of the fund's net gains, including the net gains used to pay the preferred return, until the general partner has received the full percentage amount of carried interest that the general partner is entitled to under the terms of the fund. In general, investment funds that entitle the management company to receive an incentive fee have a preferred return and are calculated on a similar basis that takes into account management fees paid.169Table of ContentsRecently Issued Accounting PronouncementsFor a full discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.""170Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to movements in the fair value of investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest, and net gains from investment activities. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Additionally, interest rate movements can adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive on credit instruments bearing variable rates and could also impact the amount of interest that we pay on debt obligations bearing variable rates. Following our acquisition of Global Atlantic, we expect to be affected by market risks arising from Global Atlantic’s business. Global Atlantic has material exposure to market volatility in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices through its insurance liabilities, many of which are structured to have exposure to market level changes, its investment portfolio and its hedge program. The quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. as of and for the period ended December 31, 2020. In all cases, these directional impacts are presented after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings. As of December 31, 2020, KKR & Co. Inc. and KKR Holdings held interests in our business of 67.5% and 32.5%, respectively. The actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below. The firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks.Management of Market Risk When we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our two Co-Chief Executive Officers, a Co-President/Co-Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, must approve the investment or transaction before it may be made. The committee may delegate authority to other employees subject to maximum commitment sizes or other limitations determined by the committee. In addition, this committee supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and the composition of our balance sheet. Certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements, and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Exchange Act. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example, and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk and capital deployed for transactions are monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above. With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee or portfolio manager; a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) then regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data, and other information relevant to a particular investment. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee or a portfolio manager, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis.Management of General Business Risk KKR has an investment management and distribution committee comprised of senior employees across our business lines, and includes our Co-Presidents/Co-Chief Operating Officers and Chief Financial Officer. The investment management and distribution committee focuses on coordinating investment and distribution activities across the firm. KKR has a risk and operations committee comprised of senior employees from across our business operations, and includes our Co-Presidents/Co- Chief Operating Officers, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. The risk and operations committee focuses on KKR's operations and enterprise risk management.171Table of Contents KKR's global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including conflicts relating to specific transactions as well as potential conflicts involving the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses. This committee also reviews and monitors certain compliance matters. Our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer are included as members of this committee.Changes in Fair Value The majority of our investments as of December 31, 2020, are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on investments held as of December 31, 2020, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a significant portion of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the consolidated statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations, (ii) the elimination of management fees and carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs, and (iii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs. Based on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2020, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2021 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors:Management FeesCarried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)10% Decline in Fair Value of Investments (1)$21,258 (2)$503,385 (3)$1,011,954 (3)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at December 31st or September 30th of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees may have been earned.(2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees.(3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.Management Fees Our management fees in our Private Markets business line are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Business Lines—Private Markets."" Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not significantly affect the amount of fees we may charge in Private Markets funds. Management fees in our infrastructure funds are calculated based on NAV of the fund and, in some cases, we additionally earn management fees on the fund's remaining commitment. In the case of our Public Markets business line, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund for that particular period, although certain funds in our Public Markets business line have management fees based on the amount of capital invested. In the case of our CLO vehicles, management fees are calculated based on the collateral of the vehicle. The collateral is based on the par value of the investments and cash on hand. To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will increase or decrease in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The 172Table of Contentsproportion of our management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fund management fees that were recognized based on the NAV of the applicable funds was approximately 22%.Publicly Traded Securities Our investment funds and KKR's balance sheet hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions, and dispositions. In addition, although a substantial portion of our investments are comprised of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these privately held investments may also fluctuate as our Level III investments are valued in part using a market comparables analysis. Consequently, due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded, the value of these Level III investments may fluctuate with market prices. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Environment.""Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds, CLO vehicles, and KKR's balance sheet hold investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. Our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (including euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, among others), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations, (ii) the elimination of carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds, and (iii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CLO vehicles. We estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as of December 31, 2020 (i.e., an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies) would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2021 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors: Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)10% Decline in Foreign Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar (1)$140,169 (2)$117,896 (2)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would not be expected to materially impact our management fees or incentive fees. The majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, our management fees that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies are generally hedged.(2)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.173Table of ContentsInterest Rate Risk Valuation of Investments Changes in credit markets and in particular, interest rates, can impact investment valuations, particularly our Level III investments, and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. Interest Income We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, hold credit investments that generate interest income based on variable interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to investments that generate yield since a meaningful portion of credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds, including CLOs, earn income based on variable interest rates. However, the contractual interest rate structure for a large portion of our credit investments bearing variable rates have ""floors,"" which establish a minimum rate of interest that will be earned. In the current low interest rate environment, a large portion of the credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds, including CLOs, are earning interest marginally above the contractual floor and therefore, for these investments, a decrease in variable interest rates would not materially impact the amount of interest income earned. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material since (i) many variable rate credit investments are subject to floors as described above and (ii) a substantial portion of this decrease would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. Interest Expense We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements, certain investment financing arrangements and debt securities issued by CLO vehicles that accrue interest at variable rates. Changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that our consolidated funds, including CLOs, would have to make. With respect to consolidated funds and CLOs, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this increase would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. With respect to debt obligations held by KKR and not in the consolidated funds or CLOs, as of December 31, 2020, KKR had debt obligations outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $258.5 million that accrues interest at a variable rate. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using interest rate swaps. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense, net of the impact of interest rate hedging strategies, would not be expected to be material.Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to reduce our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.174Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:23:39.120677

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR and does not reflect the Global Atlantic acquisition. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Business EnvironmentEconomic and Market ConditionsImpact of COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world. For a description of the impact that COVID-19 had and may in the future have on our business, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, and it has caused and may further cause disruptions to our business and adversely affect our financial results"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition"".Economic Conditions. As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. Global and regional economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments. Financial and economic conditions in the United States, European Union, Japan, China, and other major economies are significant contributors to the global economy.In 2021, the United States showed signs of economic improvement driven primarily by government fiscal and monetary support, consumer savings and vaccine rollouts. Inflation, however, is on the rise, driven by multiple factors, including supply chain disruptions, consumer demand, employment levels, and residential vacancy rates. In the United States, real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a contraction of 3.4% in the prior year; the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.9% as of December 31, 2021, from 6.7% as of December 31, 2020; the U.S. core consumer price index rose 5.5% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021, up from 1.6% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020; and the effective federal funds rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve was 0.1% as of December 31, 2021, flat from 0.1% as of December 31, 2020.In January 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled its intention to be more aggressive at the start of the tightening cycle to dampen inflation running broadly through the U.S. economy, leading to significant market volatility. In February 2022, actions taken by Russia in the Ukraine have also led to uncertainty and volatility. As of February 24, 2022, the VIX ended at 30.3, compared to 17.2 as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 76.1%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down more than 21% since the start of the year; and Brent crude oil prices topped $100 for the first time since 2014.In 2021, the Euro Area rebounded into expansion as real GDP is estimated to have risen by 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a contraction of 6.4% in the prior year; the Euro Area unemployment is estimated to have been 7.2% as of December 31, 2021, down from 8.1% as of December 31, 2020; Euro Area core inflation was 2.6% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021, up from 0.2% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020; and the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the European Central Bank was 0.0% as of December 31, 2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020.In 2021, policymakers in China introduced a campaign for “common prosperity” focused on promoting a balance among growth, inclusion, and national security considerations, which could weigh on the outlook for economic growth over the medium term. Also, China’s zero COVID tolerance policies may further impact growth over the near term as outbreaks occur. Estimated real GDP in China grew by 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to growth of 2.2% reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. Estimated core inflation in China was 1.0% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021, down from 2.5% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020. In Japan, the economy has begun to embark on post-pandemic economic recovery. In Japan, real GDP growth for the year ended December 31, 2021 is estimated to be 1.8%, up from -4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Core inflation on a year-over-year basis in Japan is estimated to have been -0.2% as of December 31, 2021, down from 0% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2020. In Japan, the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan was -0.1% as of December 31, 2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020. 130Table of ContentsThese and other key issues could have repercussions across regional and global financial markets, which could adversely affect the valuations of our investments. In particular, in response to persistent inflationary pressure, short- and medium-term interest rates may rise, which may adversely impact equity and credit markets and in turn both increase volatility in equity and debt markets and reduce economic growth. As noted above, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated that it is prepared to take action to manage inflation, including raising interests rates, tapering its asset purchases and shrinking the size of its balance sheet. In addition, commodity prices are generally expected to rise in inflationary environments, and foreign exchange rates are often affected by countries monetary and fiscal responses to inflationary trends. The Russian-Ukraine conflict, including the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's actions in February 2022, may exacerbate these issues and trends. Other key issues include (i) further developments regarding COVID-19, including the spread of variants such as Delta and Omicron, which may prolong the adverse economic impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economies, including supply chain disruptions that promote cost inflation for critical goods and labor shortages, (ii) geopolitical uncertainty such as U.S.-China relations, (iii) political uncertainty caused by, among other things, economic nationalist sentiments, tensions surrounding socioeconomic inequality issues, and partisan sentiments in the United States, all of which have potentially global ramifications with regards to policy, (iv) regulatory changes regarding, for example, taxation, international trade, cross-border investments, immigration, stimulus programs and rising levels of debt, (v) increased volatility and/or downturn in equity or credit markets, (vi) unexpected shifts in central banks' monetary policies, and (vii) technological advancements and innovations that may disrupt marketplaces and businesses. For a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition."" In addition, the U.S. Congress is proposing (and after the date of this report may propose other) various significant changes in tax law, including significant changes in the way U.S. corporations like ourselves and many of our U.S. portfolio companies are taxed. If enacted, these changes could materially increase the amount of taxes we and our portfolio companies are required to pay. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely impact our effective tax rate and tax liability.” Equity and Credit Markets. Global equity and credit markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns, which also impacts our ability to generate incentive fees and carried interest. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets raise substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. Areas that have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the United States could potentially experience further currency volatility and weakness relative to the U.S. dollar.With respect to our insurance business, fluctuations in market interest rates can expose Global Atlantic to the risk of reduced income in respect of its investment portfolio, increases in the cost of acquiring or maintaining its insurance liabilities, increases in the cost of hedging, or other fluctuations in Global Atlantic's financial, capital and operating profile which materially and adversely affect the business. Higher interest rates, periods of changes in rates and lower rates each may result in differing impacts on Global Atlantic’s business. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Global Atlantic— Interest rate fluctuations and sustained periods of low or high interest rates could adversely affect Global Atlantic’s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flows and prospects."" In our asset management business, many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. For the year ended December 31, 2021, global equity markets were positive, with the S&P 500 up 29.5% and the MSCI World Index up 22.5% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of volatility, ended at 17.2 as of December 31, 2021, decreasing from 22.8 as of December 31, 2020. See above for volatility that occurred after the year-end. For a discussion of our valuation methods, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our investments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our results of operations and financial condition” and see also “—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.” In our insurance business, a change in equity prices also impacts Global Atlantic’s equity-sensitive annuity and life insurance products, including with respect to hedging costs related to and fee-income earned on those products.131Table of ContentsMany of our investments, particularly in asset management, are in non-investment grade credit instruments, and, particularly in insurance, in investment grade credit instruments. Our funds, our portfolio companies and Global Atlantic also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. Consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. Due in part to holdings of credit instruments such as CLOs on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of losses from credit instruments on our balance sheet. Credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to an increase, and widening credit spreads are generally expected to lead to a decrease, in the value of these credit investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. In addition, the significant widening of credit spreads is also typically expected to negatively impact equity markets, which in turn would negatively impact our portfolio and us as noted above. Conversely, widening credit spreads may have a positive impact on our insurance business, as the margin Global Atlantic is able to earn between crediting rates offered on its insurance products and the investment income it earns from its credit investments should increase, and tightening credit spreads may negatively impact the pricing and therefore competitiveness of Global Atlantic’s products, adversely impacting sales and growth, or may negatively impact the margins that Global Atlantic earns on sales and transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) tightened by 5 basis points and U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads (BofAML HY Master II Index) tightened by 77 basis points. In response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's change in tone and heightened geopolitical tensions in relation to Russia and Ukraine, these trends reversed in 2022 to date through February 24, with U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) widening by 34 basis points and the U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads (BofAML HY Master II Index) widening by 83 basis points. The non-investment grade credit indices were up during the year ended December 31, 2021, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 5.2% and the BAML US High Yield Index up 5.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 10-year government bond yields rose 60 basis points in the United States, rose 77 basis points in the United Kingdom, rose 39 basis points in Germany, fell 37 basis points in China, and rose 5 basis points in Japan.

For a further discussion of our valuation methods, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies.""Foreign Exchange Rates. Foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. The appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar is expected to contribute to a decrease or increase, respectively, in the U.S. dollar value of our non-U.S. investments to the extent unhedged. In addition, an appreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to make the exports of U.S. based companies less competitive, which may lead to a decline in their export revenues, if any, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. Moreover, when selecting investments for our investment funds that are denominated in U.S. dollars, an appreciating U.S. dollar may create opportunities to invest at more attractive U.S. dollar prices in certain countries outside of the United States, while a depreciating U.S. dollar would be expected to have the opposite effect. For our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the depreciation in such currencies will generally contribute to the decrease in the valuation of such investments, to the extent unhedged, and adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial revenues 132Table of Contentsdenominated in such currencies, while the appreciation in such currencies would be expected to have the opposite effect. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the euro fell 6.9%, the British pound fell 1.0%, the Japanese yen fell 10.3%, and the Chinese renminbi rose 2.7%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk—Exchange Rate Risk.”Commodity Markets. Our Private Markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other Private Markets and Public Markets strategies have investments in or related to the energy sector. The value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil increased approximately 37%, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased approximately 17%. The 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil increased from approximately $46 per barrel to $63 per barrel, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased from approximately $2.47 per mcf to $3.13 per mcf as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As noted above, the actions taken by Russia in the Ukraine in February 2022 have also caused volatility in the commodities markets. As of February 24, 2022, the 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil increased approximately 16%, to $73 per barrel, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased approximately 11% to $3.47 per mcf. Additionally, the front month contract for WTI crude oil settled at $92 per barrel, also a level not seen since 2014.When commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted, to the extent unhedged. In general, we expect downward price movements to have a negative impact on the fair value of our energy portfolio, all other things being equal, given those commodity prices are an input in our valuation models. The reverse is true for upward price movements. However, because we typically use near-term commodity derivative transactions to hedge our exposures, we expect long-term oil and natural gas prices to be a more significant driver of the valuation of our energy investments in asset management than spot prices. In addition, to the extent energy real asset investments are directly held by our balance sheet, price movements can have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses, subject to hedging. However, as of December 31, 2021, energy investments in oil and gas assets made up only approximately 1% of our assets under management, 1% of our total GAAP assets and 1% of our total segment assets. For additional information regarding our energy real assets, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies—Fair Value Measurements—Level III Valuation Methodologies—Real Asset Investments"" and see also ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Our funds and our firm through our balance sheet may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain issuers, geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively affect our performance or the performance of our funds to the extent those concentrated assets perform poorly.""Business Conditions Our operating revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments at a profit.Our ability to attract new capital and investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as attractive means for capital appreciation or income. In addition, our ability to attract new capital and investors in our insurance business is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the life and annuity insurance industry generally, and in certain cases our re-insurance vehicles, as attractive means for capital appreciation or income. Since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as real assets, credit, core, impact and, through hedge fund partnerships, hedge funds, and insurance. In several of our asset management strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. We have also reached out to new fund investors, including retail and high net worth investors. However, fundraising continues to be competitive. While our Asian Fund IV, European Fund V, North America Fund XIII, Real Estate Partners Americas III, Real Estate Partners Europe II, Global Infrastructure Investors IV, Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II exceeded the size of their respective predecessor funds, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship investment funds or vehicles or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. If we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our AUM, FPAUM, and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our business.""Our ability to successfully deploy capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us as well as our participation in capital markets transactions. Greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to 133Table of Contentsidentify and execute attractive investments. Additionally, because we seek to make investments that have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. Reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business line, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. In our insurance business, we deploy capital by investing in assets that are anticipated to generate net investment income in excess of the net cost of insurance. If we are unable to originate or source attractive investments, the success and growth in revenues of our insurance business will be adversely impacted. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds, their portfolio companies and strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets to obtain attractive financing for their investments or to refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing or refinancing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.”Our ability to realize investments. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and result in lower-than-expected returns. Although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments from our funds, the strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically, affect the valuation of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in the portfolio companies of our funds in a timely manner. We may also realize investments through strategic sales. When financing is not available or becomes too costly, it may be more difficult to find a buyer that can successfully raise sufficient capital to purchase our investments. In addition, volatile debt and equity markets may also make the exit of our investments more difficult to execute. In our insurance business, we depend on the ability of our investments to generate their anticipated returns, through the payment of interest and dividends and interest as well as return of principal, in the amounts and at the times that we expect them to be made in order to manage our obligations to make payments to our policyholders. If policyholder behavior differs from our expectations, we may be forced to sell our investments earlier than we anticipated and during market conditions where we may realize losses on the investment. In addition, material delays in payments or impairments to our anticipated investment returns could have material adverse effects to our results of operations. For additional information about how business environment and market conditions affect Global Atlantic, see ""—Global Atlantic's Investment Portfolio."" Basis of Accounting We consolidate the financial results of KKR Group Partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, Global Atlantic’s insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds and certain other entities including collateralized financing entities (""CFEs"").When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's stockholders' equity that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. The presentation in the financial statements reflect the significant industry diversification of KKR by its acquisition of Global Atlantic. Global Atlantic operates an insurance business, and KKR operates an asset management business, each of which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, KKR developed a two-tiered presentation approach for the financial statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. KKR believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations. KKR believes that reporting Global Atlantic’s insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities, which are not obligations of KKR (other than the insurance companies that issued them). If a traditional aggregated presentation were to be used, KKR would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations but would reduce transparency. KKR also believes that using a traditional aggregated presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report. We acquired Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021; accordingly, the results of Global Atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 are from February 1, 2021 (the closing date of the acquisition) through December 31, 2021. All the intercompany transactions have been eliminated.134Table of ContentsFor a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements. The summary of the significant accounting policies has been organized considering the two-tiered approach described above and includes a section for common accounting policies and an accounting policy section for each of the two tiers when a policy is specific to one of the tiers. Key Financial Measures Under GAAP - Asset Management The following discussion of key financial measures under GAAP is based on KKR's asset management business as of December 31, 2021.RevenuesFees and Other Fees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; (v) revenue earned by oil and gas entities that are consolidated; and (vi) consulting fees. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby KKR serves as general partner and includes income or loss from KKR's capital interest as well as ""carried interest"" which entitles KKR to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners. For a further discussion of our revenue policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.ExpensesCompensation and BenefitsCompensation and Benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation, and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.To supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. We accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income and other factors determined during the year. Beginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues. Based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expect to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees to pay our asset management employees. Because these ranges are applied to applicable distributable revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total distributable revenues will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. We decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the 135Table of Contentsoccurrence of the realization event. There is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances. Assuming that we had accrued compensation of (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized net gains in our Principal Activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the ranges above), KKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders’ Equity – Series I and II Preferred, Common Stock as of December 31, 2021 would have been reduced by approximately $2.66 per share, compared to our reported $27.64 per share on such date, and our book value as of December 31, 2021 would have been reduced by approximately $2.58 per adjusted share, compared to our reported book value of $28.77 per adjusted share on such date. Carry Pool AllocationWith respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to a carry pool established at KKR Associates Holdings L.P., which is not a KKR subsidiary, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. The allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between KKR Associates Holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and are recorded as compensation expense. Upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. Accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.In February 2021, with the approval of a majority of our independent directors, KKR amended the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool to 65% for (i) current investment funds for which no or de minimis amounts of carried interest was accrued as of December 31, 2020 and (ii) all future funds. For all other funds, the percentage of carried interest remains 40% or 43%, as applicable. The percentage of carried interest allocable to the carry pool may be increased above 65% only with the approval of a majority of our independent directors. To account for the difference in the carry pool allocation percentages, we expect to use a portion of realized carried interest from the older funds equal to the difference between 65% and 40% or 43%, as applicable, to supplement the carry pool and to pay amounts as discretionary cash bonus compensation as described above to our asset management employees. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus at all for certain employees. See ""—Critical Accounting Policies - Asset Management—Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of Operations"" and ""—Key Financial Measures Under GAAP - Asset Management—Expenses—Compensation and Benefits."" On the Sunset Date (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement), KKR will acquire control of KKR Associates Holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of KKR Associates Holdings. Until the Sunset Date, our Co-Founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of KKR Associates Holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the Co-Founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice.Equity-based CompensationIn addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our Equity Incentive Plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. Certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.General, Administrative and Other General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, expenses incurred by oil and gas entities, CLOs and investment funds that are consolidated, costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions (""broken-deal expenses""), expense reimbursements, placement fees and other general operating expenses. A portion of these general administrative and other expenses, in particular broken-deal expenses, are borne by fund investors.136Table of ContentsInvestment Income (Loss)Net Gains (Losses) from Investment ActivitiesNet gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see ""—Critical Accounting Policies - Combined—Fair Value Measurements.""Dividend Income Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that we and our consolidated investment funds receive from portfolio companies or real assets investments in which we and our consolidated investment funds invest. Dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of cash generated from operations from portfolio investments or real assets investments, and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio investments.Interest Income Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our credit instruments in which we and our consolidated investment funds, CLOs and other entities invest as well as interest on our cash and other investments. Interest Expense Interest expense is incurred from (i) debt issued by KKR, including debt issued by KFN, (ii) credit facilities entered into by KKR, (iii) debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs, (iv) financing arrangements at our majority owned investment vehicles that have been funded with borrowings that are collateralized by the investments and assets they own and (v) financing arrangements at our consolidated funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN. Debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs are supported solely by the investments held at the CFE and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated investment funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. However, in some circumstances, we may provide limited guarantees of the obligations of our general partners in an amount equal to its pro rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. We also may provide other kinds of guarantees. See ""—Liquidity.""Key Financial Measures Under GAAP - InsuranceThe following discussion of key financial measures under GAAP is based on KKR's insurance business as conducted by Global Atlantic as of December 31, 2021.RevenuesPremiumsPremiums primarily relate to payout annuities with life contingencies and whole life and term life insurance policies, recognized when due from the policyholders. Premiums are reported net of premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements.Policy feesPolicy fees include charges assessed against policyholder account balances for mortality, administration, separate account, benefit rider and surrender fees.Net investment income137Table of ContentsNet investment income reflects the income earned on our investments, net of any associated investment expenses (including management fees charged by the asset management segment) and net of ceded amounts under reinsurance agreements. Net investment income includes, amongst other things (i) interest earned on our fixed income available-for-sale and fixed-income trading investments, (ii) interest income and other related fees from our mortgage and other loan receivables, (iii) interest on funds withheld at interest receivables, (iv) proportional share of income from equity-method investments and (v) income from physical assets, such as renewable energy plants, railcars, and airplanes (net of depreciation and operating expenses).Net investment-related gainsNet investment-related gains primarily consists of (i) realized gains and losses from the disposal of investments, including realized gains and losses on the disposal of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies (“variable investment income”), (ii) unrealized gains and losses from investments held for trading, or fair value remeasurements recognized in earnings as a result of the election of a fair-value option, (iii) unrealized gains and losses on funds withheld at interest receivable and payable, (iv) unrealized gains and losses from derivatives not designated in an hedging relationship and (v) allowances for credit losses, and other impairments of investments.Other incomeOther income is primarily comprised of expense allowances on ceded reinsurance, administration, management fees and distribution fees.ExpensesPolicy benefits and claimsPolicy benefits and claims represent the current period expense associated with providing insurance benefits to policyholders, including claims and benefits paid, interest credited to policyholders, changes in policy liability reserves (including fair value reserves), amortization of cost of reinsurance liabilities, and amortization of deferred sales inducements.Amortization of policy acquisition costsAmortization of policy acquisition costs primarily consist on amortization of value of business acquired and deferred policy acquisition costs. Insurance expenseInsurance expenses are primarily comprised of commissions expense, net of amounts capitalized, reinsurance ceding allowances, premium taxes, amortization of acquired intangibles and captive financing charges.Interest expenseInterest expense is incurred from insurance segment debt issued, including related interest rate swaps, credit facilities and other financing agreements.General, administrative and otherGeneral, administrative and other expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and benefit expenses, third-party administrator, or ""TPA,"" policy servicing fees, administrative and professional services, and other operating expenses.Other Key Financial Measures Under GAAP Income TaxesKKR & Co. Inc. is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes at the entity level on its share of taxable income. In addition, KKR Group Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries operate as partnerships for U.S. federal tax purposes but as taxable entities for certain state, local or non-U.S. tax purposes. Moreover, certain corporate subsidiaries of KKR, including certain Global Atlantic subsidiaries, are domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes.138Table of ContentsTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.For a further discussion of our income tax policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" and Note 18 ""Income Taxes"" in our financial statements. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership that are held by KKR Holdings (and holders of other exchangeable securities). The allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership held by KKR Holdings, we expect a portion of net income (loss) will continue to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in our business.For a further discussion of our noncontrolling interests policies, see Note 22 ""Equity"" in the financial statements. Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures The following key segment and non-GAAP performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of KKR's businesses. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. Inc. and KKR Holdings L.P. (and holders of other exchangeable securities) and as such represent the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and collateralized financing entities (“CFEs”) that KKR manages. We believe that providing these segment and non-GAAP performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable are included under ""—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures."" After-tax Distributable EarningsAfter-tax distributable earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure of KKR’s earnings, which is derived from KKR’s reported segment results. After-tax distributable earnings is used to assess the performance of KKR’s business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. After-tax distributable earnings is equal to Distributable Operating Earnings less Interest Expense, Series A and B Preferred Stock dividends (which have been redeemed), Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Income Taxes Paid. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends have been excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings, because the definition of Adjusted Shares used to calculate After-tax Distributable Earnings per Adjusted Share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock. Income Taxes Paid represents the implied amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax distributable earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all units in KKR Holdings L.P. and other exchangeable securities were exchanged for common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Income Taxes Paid includes amounts paid pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces income taxes paid or payable during the period. Equity-based compensation expense is excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings, because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR’s reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in KKR’s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor’s ability to compare KKR’s performance to these other companies. If tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes Paid, KKR’s After-tax Distributable Earnings would be lower and KKR’s effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in After-tax Distributable Earnings for the period. KKR makes these adjustments when calculating After-tax Distributable Earnings in order to more 139Table of Contentsaccurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to KKR’s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR’s business. However, After-tax Distributable Earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR’s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and After-tax Distributable Earnings should not be viewed as a measure of KKR’s liquidity.Book ValueBook Value is a non‐GAAP performance measure of the net assets of KKR and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR’s net assets presented on a basis that (i) deconsolidates KKR’s investment funds and CFEs that KKR manages, (ii) includes the net assets that are attributable to KKR Holdings L.P., and (iii) includes KKR’s ownership of the net assets of Global Atlantic. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the net assets of KKR excluding those net assets that are allocated to the investors of KKR funds and other noncontrolling interest holders and to the holders of preferred stock. KKR's book value includes (x) the net impact of KKR's tax assets and liabilities as prepared under GAAP and (y) the implied amount of (1) tax assets and liabilities attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. as if it was subject to corporate income taxes and (2) the recognition of deferred tax liabilities relating to certain assets of KKR Group Partnership L.P. that is expected to occur upon the completion of the mergers contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been included in book value, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock. To calculate Global Atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in Global Atlantic’s industry, Global Atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of income tax. In the second quarter of 2021, the definition of book value was amended to include the implied amount of tax assets and liabilities attributable to KKR Holdings L.P. as if it was subject to corporate income taxes. This change is useful to management and investors in assessing book value because the definition now includes the anticipated impacts that the payment of tax liabilities by KKR would have on book value. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change, although it is expected to have had the effect of reducing book value reported for prior periods.Starting in the third quarter of 2021, the definition of book value was amended to include the anticipated recognition of deferred tax liabilities relating to certain assets of KKR Group Partnership L.P. that is expected to occur upon the completion of the mergers contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement. This change is useful to management and investors in assessing book value because the definition now includes the anticipated impacts that the mergers contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, which are expected to be completed in 2022, would have on book value. Distributable Operating Earnings Distributable operating earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure that KKR believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Distributable Operating Earnings is presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) among KKR & Co. Inc., KKR Holdings L.P. and other exchangeable securities, and the consolidation of the investment funds, vehicles and accounts that KKR advises, manages or sponsors (including collateralized financing entities). Distributable Operating Earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges and (iv) non-recurring items, if any. Strategic corporate transaction-related items arise from corporate actions and consist primarily of (i) impairments, (ii) non-monetary gains or losses on divestitures, (iii) transaction costs from strategic acquisitions, and (iv) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by KKR as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies and (ii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where one or more KKR subsidiaries borrow from a Global Atlantic insurance subsidiary. Inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the definitive documents that contain arms’ length terms and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Distributable Operating Earnings represents operating earnings of KKR’s Asset Management and Insurance segments, which are comprised of the following:•Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings excludes (i) unrealized carried interest, (ii) net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, and (iii) related unrealized performance income compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, 140Table of Contentsvehicles and accounts, including management fees paid to KKR by Global Atlantic's insurance companies and management fees paid to Global Atlantic by reinsurance investment vehicles, are included in Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings.•Insurance Segment Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses, (iv) Income Taxes, and (v) Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The non-operating adjustments made to derive Insurance Segment Operating Earnings eliminate the impact of: (i) realized (gains) losses related to asset/liability matching investments strategies, (ii) unrealized investment (gains) losses, (iii) changes in the fair value of derivatives, embedded derivatives, and fair value liabilities for fixed-indexed annuities, indexed universal life contracts and variable annuities, and (iv) the associated income tax effects of all exclusions from Insurance Segment Operating Earnings except for equity-based compensation expense. Insurance Segment Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investments strategies and (ii) the investment management fee expenses that are earned by KKR as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies.Fee Related Earnings (""FRE"")Fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the Asset Management segment’s generation of profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on future realization events. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of KKR’s fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses and other recurring revenue streams. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees paid by the Insurance segment to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by certain insurance co-investment vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y) Other Operating Expenses.•Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Incentive Fees from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Fee-related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.•Fee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues.•Other Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses.Other Terms and Capital MetricsAdjusted SharesAdjusted shares represents shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. outstanding under GAAP adjusted to include shares issuable upon exchange of all units of KKR Holdings L.P. and other exchangeable securities and the number of shares of common stock assumed to be issuable upon conversion of the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Weighted average adjusted shares is used in the calculation of After-tax Distributable Earnings per Adjusted Share, and Adjusted Shares is used in the calculation of Book Value per Adjusted Share.Assets Under Management (""AUM"") Assets under management represent the assets managed, advised or sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds and the Global Atlantic insurance companies; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata 141Table of Contentsportion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; and (vii) the fair value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Capital Invested Capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment funds and Global Atlantic's insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested. Fee Paying AUM (""FPAUM"") Fee paying AUM represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.Uncalled Commitments Uncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.142Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from (i) North America Fund XIII, Global Infrastructure Investors IV, and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, all of which entered their investment periods in 2021 and (ii) Asian Fund IV, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III, Americas Fund XII, and Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering their post-investment periods in the third quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021, respectively, with all three investment funds now earning fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate for Asian Fund III and Americas Fund XII.Management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination of these fees does not impact the net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR stockholders' equity. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings."" Fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination of these fee credits does not impact the net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR stockholders' equity. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned 145Table of Contentsfrom companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)The increase in carried interest and general partner capital interest during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was due primarily to a higher level of net appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III and North America Fund XI. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was positive due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III and North America Fund XI.KKR generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments. Investment Income (Loss) - Asset ManagementNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2021The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million. Investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above. For a discussion and analysis of the investment gains or losses relating to the investments in our unconsolidated funds, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results."" Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net realized gains related primarily to the sales of our investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were in FanDuel Inc. (technology sector), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ: COOP), and Darktrace Limited (LSE: DARK). Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses from certain investments held in our consolidated credit funds and realized losses on certain hedging instruments.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net unrealized gains related primarily to mark-to-market gains from our investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC (health care sector), Heartland Dental LLC (health care sector) and OutSystems Holdings S.A. (technology sector). Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses, the most significant of which are (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and (ii) an unrealized loss on BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBIO).For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and Note 4 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.146Table of ContentsNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2020The net losses from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were comprised of net realized gains of $162.9 million and net unrealized gains of $3,479.9 million.Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in The Hut Group Limited (LSE: THG), (ii) partial sales of our investment in Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), and (iii) the sale of our investment in Ivalua SAS (technology sector). Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) an $88.3 million impairment charge taken on one of our investments that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, (ii) a realized loss on the partial sale of our investment in LCI Helicopters Limited (financial services sector) and (iii) realization of losses on certain investments held through consolidated CLOs and alternative credit funds.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains in our growth equity and core investments held by KKR and certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., FanDuel Inc., and PetVet Care Centers, LLC. Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above, (ii) mark-to-market losses on our investment in Fiserv, Inc., which is held both in our funds and as a co-investment by KKR, and (iii) mark-to-market losses on certain investments held through consolidated alternative credit and real estate funds.For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" in our report and Note 4 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Dividend Income During the year ended December 31, 2021, the most significant dividends received included (i) $215.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds, (ii) $138.7 million from our investment in Viridor Limited (infrastructure), and (iii) $70.9 million from our investment in Arnott's Biscuits Limited (consumer products sector). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the most significant dividends received included $152.4 million from our consolidated real estate funds, $62.5 million from our investment in Fiserv, Inc. part of which is held as a co-investment by KKR, and $48.9 million from our investment in Epicor Software Corporation (technology sector).Significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results."" Interest Income The increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) a higher level of interest income from certain of our consolidated credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed, and (ii) the impact of closing additional CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest income from investments at KREF as a result of the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""Interest Expense The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) the impact of issuances of our senior notes, (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from the financing arrangements of consolidated investment funds and other vehicles, and (iii) impact of closing additional CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest expense on debt obligations at KREF as a result of the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""147Table of ContentsExpenses - Asset ManagementCompensation and Benefits Expenses The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of accrued carried interest compensation resulting from a higher level of carried interest from the appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio in the current period, (ii) a higher level of accrued discretionary compensation and benefits resulting from a higher level of fee revenue, realized performance income and realized investment income in the current period, and (iii) a higher level of equity-based compensation. The number of equity-based compensation awards granted in 2021 is higher than in 2020, which combined with a higher stock price than the prior period will result in a higher equity-based compensation expense in the coming years. Based on equity awards made through December 31, 2021, and assuming no additional grants and no forfeitures, equity-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022 would be comprised of $211.9 million of expense associated with time-based vesting awards and $237.5 million of expense associated with performance-based vesting awards. Additional grants made in 2022 or forfeitures of existing grants during 2022 would increase and decrease these numbers, respectively.General, Administrative and OtherThe increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of expenses at our consolidated CLOs, investment funds and other vehicles, (ii) a higher level of broken-deal expenses, (iii) a higher level of expenses reimbursable by our investment funds, and (iv) placement fees incurred related to capital raising activities. The level of broken-deal expenses can vary significantly period to period based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are the number of potential investments being pursued for our investment funds, the size and complexity of investments being pursued and the number of investment funds currently in their investment period. Also, in periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other may increase accordingly. Similarly, our General, Administrative and Other may increase as a result of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development.148Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) - InsuranceFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, the results of Global Atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, February 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.Assumption reviewThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities or an increase in deferred expenses, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.The following table reflects the impact on net income by financial statement line item and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from Global Atlantic’s assumption review:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021($ in thousands)Impacts of assumption review, by statement of income line item:Policy fees$182 Policy benefits and claims20,904 Amortization of policy acquisition costs(2,119)Income tax impact(3,983)Total assumption review impact on net income$14,984 Assumption review impact on adjustments to derive insurance segment adjusted operating earnings(97)Total assumption review impact on insurance segment adjusted operating earnings$14,887 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net favorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to favorable mortality experience.RevenuesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Net Premiums$2,226,078 Policy Fees1,147,913 Net Investment Income2,845,623 Net Investment-Related Gains203,753 Other Income120,213 Total Insurance Revenues$6,543,580 Net PremiumsNet premiums were primarily driven by initial premiums related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies assumed during the year ended December 31, 2021. These initial premiums are wholly offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).149Table of ContentsPolicy feesPolicy fees were primarily driven by cost of insurance, administrative, and rider fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.Net investment incomeNet investment income was primarily driven by insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as determined as of the GA Acquisition Date). Average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. In addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also positively impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity.Net investment-related gainsThe components of net investment-related gains were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Equity index options$549,987 Funds withheld payable embedded derivatives49,491 Funds withheld receivable embedded derivatives31,740 Equity future contracts(263,637)Interest rate contracts(146,920)Foreign currency forwards2,484 Credit risk contracts(400)Net gains on derivative instruments222,745 Net other investment losses(18,992)Net investment-related gains$203,753 Net gains on derivative instrumentsThe increase in the fair value of equity index options were primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change for which is accounted for in policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index call options are based on the S&P 500 index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2021.The decrease in the fair value of equity futures and interest rate contracts were driven primarily by the performance of equity markets and interest rates. Global Atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in our variable annuity products which are accounted for in policy benefits and claims. The majority of Global Atlantic's equity futures are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on equity futures contracts. Market interest rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts. The increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable and receivable were primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the respective funds withheld payable and receivable portfolios.150Table of ContentsNet other investment lossesThe components of net other investment losses were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies$527,788 Realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities(201,411)Credit loss allowances(249,338)Unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities classified as trading(118,714)Unrealized gains (losses) on investments classified as trading or accounted under a fair-value option75,176 Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio(30,015)Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest receivable portfolio12,418 Other(34,896)Net investment-related gains$(18,992)Net other investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to (i) the recognition of a credit loan loss allowances as a result of the application of the current expected credit loss accounting standard adopted concurrent with the GA Acquisition, (ii) losses on the sale of available-for-sale (""AFS"") securities as a result of portfolio rotation strategies, and (iii) net unrealized losses on trading fixed maturity securities underlying a portion of the funds withheld payable at interest portfolio due to an increase in market interest rates. These losses were almost wholly offset by realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies, including in particular a gain from the disposition of Origis USA, LLC, a utility-scale renewable energy developer.Other incomeOther income is mainly driven by expense allowances on ceded reinsurance, administration, management fees and distribution fees.ExpensesPolicy benefits and claimsPolicy benefits and claims were primarily driven by (i) initial reserves related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies during the year ended December 31, 2021, (ii) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of higher equity market returns (as discussed above under ""Revenues—Total Insurance Revenues—Net gains on derivative instruments,"" Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in policy benefits and claims), and (iii) an increase in net flows in the institutional and individual channels, all offset by a decrease in variable annuity reserves primarily due to higher equity market returns and market interest rates.Amortization of policy acquisition costsAmortization of policy acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the amortization of insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the Global Atlantic acquisition. Amortization is negative (that is, a reduction to expense) as a result of the net negative value-of-business-acquired insurance intangible recognized as part of the aforementioned purchase accounting.Interest expenseInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a net increase in debt outstanding due to the issuance of new senior and subordinated notes partially offset by the pay-down of other debt, offset in part by the favorable impact to interest expense as a result of the lower average coupon due on new debt added at lower interest rates.Insurance expensesInsurance expenses were primarily driven by (i) commission expense related to sales, and (ii) reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services during the year ended December 31, 2021.151Table of ContentsGeneral, administrative and otherGeneral, administrative and other expenses were driven primarily by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) third-party administrator (""TPA"") policy servicing fees, (iii) technology hardware and software related charges, and (iv) professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.Other Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) Income Tax Expense (Benefit)For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax expense was $1,353.3 million compared to $609.1 million in the prior period. The increase in the income tax expense was primarily due to (i) a higher level of fees, capital allocation-based income and investment income as described above earned from asset management operations and (ii) the inclusion of income taxes relating to Global Atlantic's insurance operations. Our effective tax rate under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 9.9%. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 ""Income Taxes"" in our financial statements. The amount of U.S. corporate income taxes we pay in future periods may be materially increased if adverse tax laws become enacted. See also “—Business Environment—Economic and Market Conditions” in this report. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) interests of KKR Holdings and other exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership, (ii) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and (iii) interests that co-investors and rollover investors hold in Global Atlantic. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to a higher level of net income generated during the year ended December 31, 2021, allocable to the holders of the noncontrolling interests.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. Net Income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to (i) a higher level of net gains from investment activities, capital allocation-based income, and fees earned from the asset management operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as described above and (ii) the acquisition of Global Atlantic, which was completed in February 2021. These increases were partially offset by accrued carried interest compensation and income tax expense, each as described above.152Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III as it entered its post investment period in the third quarter of 2020, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and pays fees at a lower rate and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from European Fund IV as it entered its post investment period in the second quarter of 2019, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than remaining commitments and capital invested during the investment period.Transaction fees increased overall primarily from a higher level of transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in transaction fees earned in our Private Markets business line, and to a lesser extent, our Public Markets business line. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings."" Fee credits decreased compared to the prior period as a result of a lower level of transaction fees in our Private Markets andPublic Markets business lines.Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. Transaction fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit.155Table of ContentsCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower carried interest allocations from 2006 Fund and Asia Fund II. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in carried interest allocations from Americas Fund XII and Global Infrastructure Investors II.KKR generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments. Investment Income (Loss) - Asset ManagementNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2020The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were comprised of net realized gains of $162.9 million and net unrealized gains of $3,479.9 million. Investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above. For a discussion and analysis of the primary investment gains or losses relating to individual investments in our unconsolidated funds, see ""— Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in The Hut Group Limited, (ii) partial sales of our investment in Fiserv, Inc., and (iii) the sale of our investment in Ivalua SAS. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) an $88.3 million impairment charge taken on one of our investments that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, (ii) a realized loss on the partial sale of our investment in LCI Helicopters Limited and (iii) realization of losses on certain investments held through consolidated CLOs and alternative credit funds.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains in our growth equity and core investments held by KKR and certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., FanDuel Inc., and PetVet Care Centers, LLC. Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above (ii) mark-to-market losses on our investment in Fiserv, Inc., which is held both in our funds and as a co-investment by KKR, and (iii) mark-to-market losses on certain investments held through consolidated alternative credit and real estate funds.For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and Note 4 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2019The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were comprised of net realized gains of $497.3 million and net unrealized gains of $2,664.5 million.156Table of ContentsRealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net realized gains related primarily to realized gains on (i) the sale of our investment in Trainline PLC (LSE: TRN), (ii) the sales of assets in our consolidated real estate funds, (iii) the sale of our investment in Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc. (financial services sector) and (iv) the sales of assets in our consolidated special situations funds. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which related to the sale of investments held by our consolidated CLOs and the sale of our investment in DoubleDutch, Inc. (technology sector).Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains on the growth equity investments held by KKR and certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which was BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., (ii) mark-to-market gains in portfolio companies in our core investment strategy, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC, Heartland Dental, LLC, and USI, Inc. (financial services sector) and (iii) mark-to-market gains on our investment in Fiserv, Inc., which is held both in our funds and as a balance sheet co-investment by KKR. Partially offsetting the unrealized gains above were unrealized losses relating to (i) mark-to-market losses in our energy investments held through certain consolidated entities, (ii) mark-to-market losses on investments held at our consolidated special situations funds, (iii) mark-to-market losses on investments held at our India debt financing company and (iv) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and Note 4 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Dividend Income During the year ended December 31, 2020, the most significant dividends received included $152.4 million from our consolidated real estate funds, $62.5 million from our investment in Fiserv, Inc. part of which is held as a co-investment by KKR and $48.9 million from our investment in Epicor Software Corporation. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the most significant dividends received included $195.3 million from our investment in Fiserv, Inc., $36.0 million from our consolidated real estate funds, $29.1 million from our consolidated special situations funds, $14.1 million from infrastructure investments held by KKR and $12.7 million from our consolidated energy funds. Significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results."" Interest Income The decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a lower level of interest earned from (i) investments held at our consolidated special situations funds and (ii) loans held by KREF, a listed REIT. These decreases were partially offset by (i) the impact of closing additional consolidated CLOs subsequent to December 31, 2019 and (ii) an increase in interest income from certain of our consolidated direct lending funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a lower level of interest expense on debt obligations of the consolidated CLOs and KREF due to a decrease in interest rates subsequent to December 31, 2019 and (ii) the redemption of our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 in the third quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of multiple issuances of senior notes subsequent to December 31, 2019, which included: (i) $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2050, (ii) $250 million aggregate principal amount of $3.750% Senior Notes due 2029 and (iii) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2050. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""157Table of ContentsExpenses - Asset ManagementCompensation and Benefits Expenses The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of cash compensation resulting from a higher level of fees earned and (ii) a higher level of equity-based compensation resulting from certain equity awards that were granted in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which a portion vested immediately. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in carried interest compensation resulting from a lower level of carried interest generated in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period.General, Administrative and OtherThe decrease in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a decrease in capital raising costs and (ii) a decrease in corporate travel-related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partially offsetting these decreases were corporate transaction-related charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of Global Atlantic.Other Unaudited Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) Income Tax Expense (Benefit)For the year ended December 31, 2020, income tax expense was $609.1 million compared to $528.8 million for the prior period. Our effective tax rate under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 10.6%. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 18 ""Income Taxes"" in our financial statements. See also “—Business Environment” in this report. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2020 related primarily to net income attributable to KKR Holdings representing its ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership as well as third-party limited partner interests in those investment funds that we consolidate. The increase from the prior period is due primarily to an increase in the number of consolidated funds, partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to KKR Holdings.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Net Income (Loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. was $25.7 million lower compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to (i) a lower level of accrued carried interest and (ii) Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends in each case in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by (i) lower accrued carried interest compensation, (ii) lower level of General, Administrative and Other expenses and (iii) an increase in management fees, in each case in 2020 and as described above.158Table of ContentsCondensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (GAAP Basis) The following table provides the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on a GAAP basis as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)As ofAs ofDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020AssetsAsset ManagementCash and Cash Equivalents$6,699,668 $6,507,874 Investments88,775,514 69,274,715 Other Assets4,244,894 4,023,913 99,720,076 79,806,502 InsuranceCash and Cash Equivalents3,391,934 — Investments123,763,675 — Other Assets37,409,755 — 164,565,364 — Total Assets$264,285,440$79,806,502Liabilities and EquityAsset ManagementDebt Obligations$36,669,755 $33,423,596 Other Liabilities8,359,619 5,582,990 45,029,374 39,006,586 InsuranceDebt Obligations1,908,006 — Other Liabilities159,208,840 — 161,116,846 — Total Liabilities$206,146,220 $39,006,586 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests82,491 — Stockholders' EquityKKR & Co.

You should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities, which include certain consolidated investment funds, CLOs and certain variable interest entities formed by Global Atlantic notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those investment funds and CFEs. The assets of our consolidated investment funds and CFEs, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and CFEs involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities Our net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $(7.2) billion and $(6.0) billion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) investments purchased (asset management), net of proceeds from investments (asset management) of $(10.6) billion and $(5.9) billion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (ii) net realized gains (losses) on asset management investments of $2,382.2 million and $162.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on asset management investments of $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (iv) capital allocation-based income (loss) of $6.8 billion and $2.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and (v) net realized gains (losses) on insurance operations of $(860.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Investment funds are investment companies under GAAP and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. Net Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities Our net cash provided (used) by investing activities was $(9.6) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures and Other Terms and Operating Metric"" and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. See ""—Business Environment"" for more information about factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.In connection with our acquisition of Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021, management reevaluated the manner in which we manage and assess the performance of our business and allocate resources. As a result, we introduced a new Insurance segment in 2021 and report segment results for two operating and reportable segments: Asset Management and Insurance. See Note 21 “Segment Reporting” in our financial statements.Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating ResultsThe following tables set forth information regarding KKR's Asset Management segment operating results and certain key capital metrics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Management Fees$2,071,440 $1,441,578 $629,862 Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net1,004,241 632,433 371,808 Fee Related Performance Revenues45,852 39,555 6,297 Fee Related Compensation(702,387)(486,481)(215,906)Other Operating Expenses(449,155)(346,558)(102,597)Fee Related Earnings1,969,991 1,280,527 689,464 Realized Performance Income2,141,596 1,165,699 975,897 Realized Performance Income Compensation(1,239,177)(697,071)(542,106)Realized Investment Income1,613,244 644,659 968,585 Realized Investment Income Compensation(241,994)(106,830)(135,164)Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$4,243,660 $2,286,984 $1,956,676 Management FeesThe following table presents management fees by business line for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Management FeesPrivate Markets$1,404,140 $976,607 $427,533 Public Markets667,300 464,971 202,329 Total Management Fees$2,071,440 $1,441,578 $629,862 The increase in Private Markets management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from (i) North America Fund XIII, Global Infrastructure Investors IV, and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, all of which entered their investment periods in 2021 and (ii) Asian Fund IV, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III, Americas Fund XII and Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering their post-investment periods in the third quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021, and second quarter of 2021, respectively, with all three investment funds now earning fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate for Asian Fund III and Americas Fund XII.161Table of ContentsThe increase in Public Markets management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees earned from Global Atlantic during the period February 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, (ii) the issuance of new CLOs subsequent to December 31, 2020, (iii) higher overall FPAUM at our hedge fund partnerships from investment appreciation and, to a lesser extent, net capital inflows and (iv) net capital inflows in certain leveraged credit strategy accounts.Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetPrivate Markets$143,165 $148,407 $(5,242)Public Markets14,181 3,543 10,638 Capital Markets846,895 480,483 366,412 Total Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net$1,004,241 $632,433 $371,808 Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. The increase in transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, we completed 358 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings, as compared to 193 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which 36 represented equity offerings and 157 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 23% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 18% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 58% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.Our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors.The decrease in Private Markets transaction and monitoring fees, net was primarily attributable to the write-off of outstanding monitoring fee receivables for two portfolio companies, partially offset by an increase in net transaction fees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were 99 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.9 million compared to 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 55% of these transaction fees were paid by companies in North America, 25% were paid from companies in Europe, and 20% were paid from companies in the Asia-Pacific region. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular agreements as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction, and KKR's role in the transaction. Additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. 162Table of ContentsFee Related Performance RevenuesThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by business line for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Fee Related Performance RevenuesPrivate Markets$9,068 $4,797 $4,271 Public Markets36,784 34,758 2,026 Total Fee Related Performance Revenues$45,852 $39,555 $6,297 Fee related performance revenues earned in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines represent realized incentive fees that are (i) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (ii) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. These incentive fees are primarily earned from our business development company, FS KKR Capital Corp. (""FSK"") in our Public Markets business line and our real estate credit investment trust, KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. (""KREF"") in our Private Markets business line. The increase was primarily due to a higher level of investment income at these entities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior period.Fee Related Compensation The increase in fee related compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings. Other Operating ExpensesThe increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of (i) professional fees and other administrative costs in connection with the overall growth of the firm and (ii) placement fees related to capital raising activities.Fee Related EarningsThe increase in fee related earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of management fees in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines and transaction fees from our Capital Markets business line, partially offset by a higher level of fee related compensation and other operating expenses, as described above.Realized Performance IncomeThe following table presents realized performance income by business line for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Realized Performance IncomePrivate Markets$1,776,065 $1,015,865 $760,200 Public Markets365,531 149,834 215,697 Total Realized Performance Income$2,141,596 $1,165,699 $975,897 163Table of ContentsYear EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Private MarketsNorth America Fund XI$433,708 $203,606 $230,102 Asian Fund III387,863 46,347 341,516 2006 Fund219,737 181,899 37,838 Americas Fund XII207,559 — 207,559 European Fund IV186,476 139,948 46,528 Co-Investment Vehicles and Other93,588 93,650 (62)Core Investment Vehicles80,937 57,484 23,453 Global Infrastructure Investors II72,862 148,882 (76,020)Next Generation Technology Growth Fund32,544 13,964 18,580 Real Estate Partners Europe18,200 — 18,200 Global Infrastructure Investors2,967 54,729 (51,762)European Fund III353 — 353 Asian Fund II— 60,647 (60,647)Real Estate Partners Americas— 4,977 (4,977)Asian Fund— 431 (431)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)1,736,794 1,006,564 730,230 Incentive Fees39,271 9,301 29,970 Total Realized Performance Income$1,776,065 $1,015,865 $760,200 Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Public MarketsOther Alternative Credit Vehicles$15,336 $25,740 $(10,404)Mezzanine Partners— 9,900 (9,900)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)15,336 35,640 (20,304)Incentive Fees350,195 114,194 236,001 Total Realized Performance Income$365,531 $149,834 $215,697 (1)The above tables exclude any funds for which there was no realized carried interest during both of the periods presented.

(NYSE: IR), Academy Sports & Outdoors Inc. (NASDAQ: ASO), Kokusai Electric Corporation (manufacturing sector) and Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: EDR).Realized carried interest in our Private Markets business line for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of realized proceeds from the sales of our investments in Deutsche Glasfaser (telecom sector), Privilege Underwriters, Inc. (financial services sector), LGC Science Group Limited (health care sector), Epicor Software Corporation, The Hut Group Limited and Fiserv, Inc.Realized carried interest in our Public Markets business line decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period as a result of a lower level of realization activity at certain alternative credit investment funds, from which we are eligible to take cash carry.164Table of ContentsIncentive fees earned in our Private Markets business line consist primarily of incentive fees earned from assets we manage under a sub-advisory agreement with a U.K. investment fund. The increase in incentive fees for year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to a higher level of investment appreciation. Incentive fees earned in our Public Markets business line consist primarily of incentive fees earned from our hedge fund partnerships and certain incentive fee eligible leveraged credit accounts. The increase in incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to a higher level of incentive fees earned from Marshall Wace.Realized Performance Income CompensationThe increase in realized performance income compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of realized performance income.Realized Investment IncomeThe following table presents realized investment income from our Principal Activities business line for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Realized Investment IncomeNet Realized Gains (Losses)$1,199,414 $284,521 $914,893 Interest Income and Dividends413,830 360,138 53,692 Total Realized Investment Income$1,613,244 $644,659 $968,585 The increase in realized investment income is due to a higher level of net realized gains and, to a lesser extent, a higher level of interest income and dividends.

Public MarketsAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Public Markets business line had $10.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Uncalled commitments remained flat against the comparable period as new capital commitments from fund investors were offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.Capital InvestedPrivate Markets For the year ended December 31, 2021, $38.9 billion of capital was invested by our Private Markets business line, as compared to $19.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven primarily by a $16.6 billion increase in capital invested in our real assets strategies, and a $1.9 billion increase in capital invested in our core investment and private equity strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 57% of capital deployed in private equity, growth equity (including impact) and core investments was in transactions in North America, 23% was in Europe, and 20% was in the Asia-Pacific region. Generally, the portfolio companies acquired through our private equity and core funds have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets funds. The number of large private equity and core investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.169Table of ContentsPublic Markets For the year ended December 31, 2021, $34.4 billion of capital was invested by our Public Markets business line, as compared to $10.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to (i) capital deployed under our investment management agreements with Global Atlantic's insurance companies and (ii) a higher level of capital deployed across our direct lending and SIG strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 90% of capital deployed was in transactions in North America, 9% was in Europe and 1% was in the Asia-Pacific region.Analysis of Insurance Segment Operating ResultsAs discussed above, our Insurance segment consists solely of the operations of Global Atlantic, which was acquired on February 1, 2021. Accordingly, prior periods have been excluded for Insurance segment results. For the year-ended December 31, 2021, the results of our Insurance segment is from the acquisition date, February 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.The following tables set forth information regarding KKR's insurance segment operating results and certain key operating metrics as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021($ in thousands)Net Investment Income$3,329,570 Net Cost of Insurance(1,566,681)General, Administrative and Other(500,410)Pre-tax Insurance Operating Earnings1,262,479 Income Taxes(199,095)Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(410,833)Insurance Segment Operating Earnings$652,551 Insurance segment operating earningsInsurance segment operating earnings were primarily driven by net investment income and stable net cost of insurance. Net investment incomeNet investment income was primarily driven by (i) insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as of the closing date of the Global Atlantic), and (ii) variable investment income from net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies, including in particular the disposition of Origis USA, LLC, a utility-scale renewable energy developer. Average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. In addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity.Net cost of insuranceNet cost of insurance was driven primarily by stable liability performance across in-force and new business, including favorable adjustments to reserves and policy acquisition costs resulting from higher reserves and insurance intangibles established as part of the purchase accounting for the GA Acquisition and the impact of assumption review (as described in “ –Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) – Insurance (Unaudited)” above).General, administrative and other expensesGeneral and administrative expenses were driven by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) policy servicing fees, (iii) technology-related charges and (iv) consulting and professional fees.170Table of ContentsIncome taxesInsurance segment income tax expense reflects the effective tax rate for the insurance segment on an operating basis, including the benefit of investment tax credits.Net Income attributable to non-controlling interestsIncome attributable to non-controlling interests represent the portion of the insurance segment adjusted operating earnings attributable to rollover and co-investors in Global Atlantic.Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance MeasuresThe following is a discussion of our Non-GAAP performance measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$4,243,660 $2,286,984 $1,956,676 Insurance Segment Operating Earnings652,551 — 652,551 Distributable Operating Earnings4,896,211 2,286,984 2,609,227 Interest Expense(250,183)(211,037)(39,146)Preferred Dividends(19,201)(33,364)14,163 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(23,664)(7,842)(15,822)Income Taxes Paid(687,572)(265,950)(421,622)After-tax Distributable Earnings$3,915,591 $1,768,791 $2,146,800 As discussed in the Analysis of Segment Operating Results, following the acquisition of Global Atlantic, we re-evaluated our operating structure and the manner by which we manage and assess the performance of our businesses and allocates our resources. In the first quarter of 2021 we changed the presentation of our non-GAAP performance measures principally to reflect how we evaluate our business following the Global Atlantic acquisition. We also believe that this revised presentation improves the comparability of our non-GAAP financial information with that provided by other publicly traded companies in the alternative asset management industry.Distributable Operating Earnings The increase in distributable operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of Asset Management segment operating earnings and the addition of our Insurance segment operating earnings in connection with the Global Atlantic acquisition. For a discussion of the Asset Management and Insurance segment operating earnings, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results and Analysis of Insurance Segment Operating Results."" Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest expense relates primarily to the interest expense from our senior notes outstanding for KKR and KFN. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to new note issuances.Preferred Dividends The decrease in preferred dividends for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was attributable to the redemption of all of our Series A and B preferred stock outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021.171Table of ContentsIncome Taxes Paid The increase in income taxes paid for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings.After-tax Distributable Earnings The increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid and interest expense, as discussed above.For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation included in income taxes paid was $123.1 million and $59.1 million, respectively. The inclusion of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation in After-tax Distributable Earnings had the effect of increasing this measure by 3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating ResultsThe following tables set forth information regarding KKR's Asset Management segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Management Fees$1,441,578 $1,248,517 $193,061 Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net632,433 564,259 68,174 Fee Related Performance Revenues39,555 53,024 (13,469)Fee Related Compensation(486,481)(431,973)(54,508)Other Operating Expenses(346,558)(353,565)7,007 Fee Related Earnings1,280,527 1,080,262 200,265 Realized Performance Income1,165,699 1,083,020 82,679 Realized Performance Income Compensation(697,071)(698,145)1,074 Realized Investment Income644,659 685,773 (41,114)Realized Investment Income Compensation(106,830)(108,385)1,555 Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$2,286,984 $2,042,525 $244,459 Management FeesThe following table presents management fees by business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Management FeesPrivate Markets$976,607 $800,068 $176,539 Public Markets464,971 448,449 16,522 Total Management Fees$1,441,578 $1,248,517 $193,061 The increase in Private Markets management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Asian Fund IV, Next Generation Technology Growth Fund II, and Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors which entered their investment periods subsequent to December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III as it entered its post-investment period in the third quarter of 2020, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and pays fees at a lower rate, and (ii) a decrease in management fees earned from 172Table of ContentsEuropean Fund IV as it entered its post investment period in the second quarter of 2019, in which it pays fees based on capital invested rather than remaining commitments and capital invested during the investment period.The increase in Public Markets management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from new capital raised within the leveraged credit strategy, the issuance of new CLOs and greater overall FPAUM at our direct lending and asset-based finance strategies, partially offset by a lower level of management fees earned in certain alternative credit strategies, most notably special situations.Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetPrivate Markets$148,407 $150,103 $(1,696)Public Markets3,543 4,101 (558)Capital Markets480,483 410,055 70,428 Total Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net$632,433 $564,259 $68,174 Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. The increase in transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the size of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Overall, we completed 193 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which 36 represented equity offerings and 157 represented debt offerings, as compared to 192 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which 28 represented equity offerings and 164 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 18% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 58% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 61% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.Our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors.The decrease in Private Markets transaction and monitoring fees, net was primarily attributable to a decrease in net transaction fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.2 million compared to 59 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 36% of these transaction fees were paid by companies in North America, 34% were paid from companies in Europe, and 30% of these transaction fees were paid from companies in the Asia-Pacific region. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular agreements as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction, and KKR's role in the transaction. Additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. 173Table of ContentsPartially offsetting the decrease in net transaction fees was an increase in net monitoring fees. The increase in net monitoring fees was primarily due to an increase in recurring monitoring fees compared to the prior period, as well as higher termination payments. Recurring monitoring fees increased $10.5 million, which was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying monitoring fees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had 66 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.7 million compared with 59 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received termination payments of $13.2 million in connection with the IPOs of Academy Sports & Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASO) and Calisen PLC (LSE: CLSN LN) compared to $2.1 million of termination payments received in the year ended December 31, 2019 relating to the IPO of Trainline PLC. These termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with the IPO and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio.Fee Related Performance RevenuesThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Fee Related Performance RevenuesPrivate Markets$4,797 $2,316 $2,481 Public Markets34,758 50,708 (15,950)Total Fee Related Performance Revenues$39,555 $53,024 $(13,469)Fee related performance revenues earned in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines represent realized incentive fees that are (i) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (ii) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. These incentive fees are primarily earned from our business development companies in our Public Markets business line and our real estate credit investment trust, KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. (""KREF"") in our Private Markets business line. The decrease was primarily due to a lower level of investment income at our business development companies during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior period. Fee Related CompensationThe increase in fee related compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings. Other Operating ExpensesThe decrease in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a decrease in travel related expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by a higher level of professional fees and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm. Fee Related EarningsThe increase in fee related earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of management fees and transaction fees from our Capital Markets business line, partially offset by a higher level of fee related compensation and a lower level of fee related performance revenues, as described above.174Table of ContentsRealized Performance IncomeThe following table presents realized performance income by business line for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Realized Performance IncomePrivate Markets$1,015,865 $1,046,038 $(30,173)Public Markets149,834 36,982 112,852 Total Realized Performance Income$1,165,699 $1,083,020 $82,679 Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Private MarketsNorth America Fund XI$203,606 $341,602 $(137,996)2006 Fund181,899 143,692 38,207 Global Infrastructure Investors II148,882 — 148,882 European Fund IV139,948 221,222 (81,274)Co-Investment Vehicles and Other93,650 70,179 23,471 Asian Fund II60,647 126,039 (65,392)Core Investment Vehicles57,484 14,449 43,035 Global Infrastructure Investors54,729 — 54,729 Asian Fund III46,347 36,707 9,640 Next Generation Technology Growth Fund13,964 — 13,964 Real Estate Partners Americas4,977 7,439 (2,462)Asian Fund431 10,913 (10,482)European Fund III— 65,700 (65,700)European Fund II— 5,058 (5,058)China Growth Fund— 3,038 (3,038)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)1,006,564 1,046,038 (39,474)Incentive Fees9,301 — 9,301 Total Realized Performance Income$1,015,865 $1,046,038 $(30,173)Year EndedDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Change($ in thousands)Public MarketsOther Alternative Credit Vehicles$25,740 $14,850 $10,890 Mezzanine Partners9,900 9,900 — Total Realized Carried Interest (1)35,640 24,750 10,890 Incentive Fees114,194 12,232 101,962 Total Realized Performance Income$149,834 $36,982 $112,852 (1)The above tables exclude any funds for which there was no realized carried interest during both of the periods presented.

Investments presented are principally the assets measured at fair value that are held by KKR's asset management segment, which, among other things, does not include the underlying investments held by Global Atlantic and Marshall Wace.(2)Significant Investments include the top five investments based on their fair values as of December 31, 2021. Significant Investments exclude (i) investments expected to be syndicated, (ii) investments expected to be transferred in connection with a new fundraising, and (iii) investments in funds and other entities that are owned by one or more third parties and established for the purpose of making investments. Accordingly, this list of Significant Investments should not be relied upon as a substitute for information about the asset class exposure of KKR's balance sheet. For information about the asset class exposure of KKR's balance sheet see ""—Our Business—Principal Activities"" for the ""Holdings by Asset Class"" pie chart. The fair value figures include the co-investment and the limited partner and/or general partner interests held by KKR in the underlying investment, if applicable.180Table of ContentsWith respect to KKR's book value relating to its insurance business, KKR includes Global Atlantic's book value, which consists of KKR's pro rata equity interest in Global Atlantic on a GAAP basis, excluding (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance embedded derivative balances and related assets, net of deferred acquisition costs and income tax. KKR believes this presentation of Global Atlantic's book value is comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in Global Atlantic's industry. As of December 31, 2021, KKR's pro rata interest in Global Atlantic's book value was $3.4 billion. For more information about the composition and credit quality of Global Atlantic's investments on a consolidated basis, please see ""--Global Atlantic's Investment Portfolio"" below. Global Atlantic's Investment PortfolioAs of December 31, 2021, 97% and 87% of Global Atlantic's AFS fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (""NAIC"") and nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (""NRSROs""), respectively. Securities where a rating by an NRSRO was not available are considered investment grade if they have an NAIC designation of “1” or “2.” The three largest asset categories in Global Atlantic's AFS fixed-maturity security portfolio as of December 31, 2021 were Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, comprising 34%, 6% and 5% of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. Within these categories, 95%, 96% and 99% of Global Atlantic's Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NAIC ratings and 95%, 38% and 62% of its Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NRSRO ratings as of December 31, 2021. NRSRO and NAIC ratings have different methodologies. Global Atlantic believes the NAIC ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its AFS fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. The portion of Global Atlantic's AFS fixed maturity portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 36% as of December 31, 2021.Within the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 96% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by NAIC designation as of December 31, 2021. Global Atlantic also maintains a $13.8 billion fixed maturity securities portfolio classified as trading which underlie the funds withheld payable at interest obligation from certain reinsurance transactions. The investment performance from the fixed maturity securities in this trading portfolio is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of their reinsurance agreements.Credit quality of AFS fixed maturity securitiesThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the AFS fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called “NAIC designations.” Using an internally developed rating is permitted by the NAIC if no rating is available. These designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. NAIC designations of “1,” highest quality, and “2,” high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by NRSROs. NAIC designations “3” through “6” include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by NRSROs.Consistent with the NAIC Process and Procedures Manual, an NRSRO rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (i) the equivalent S&P rating where the security is rated by one NRSRO; (ii) the equivalent S&P rating of the lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by two NRSROs; and (iii) the equivalent S&P rating of the second lowest NRSRO if the security is rated by three or more NRSROs. If the lowest two NRSROs’ ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. NRSROs’ ratings available for the periods presented were S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.Substantially all of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, 97% as of December 31, 2021, was invested in investment grade assets with a NAIC rating of 1 or 2.The portion of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by NAIC designation was 3% as of December 31, 2021. Pursuant to Global Atlantic's investment guidelines, it actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated NAIC 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from Global Atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated NAIC 3 or lower.As of December 31, 2021, the non-rated AFS fixed-maturity securities include $118.8 million of private placement securities for which Global Atlantic has not sought individual ratings from the NRSROs.181Table of ContentsCorporate fixed maturity securitiesGlobal Atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. As of December 31, 2021, 60% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities. As of December 31, 2021, 95% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated NAIC investment grade, and 95% is rated NRSROs investment grade. Residential mortgage-backed securitiesAs of December 31, 2021, 11% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in RMBS. RMBS are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, we would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.The NAIC designations for RMBS, including prime, sub-prime, alt-A, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options (""Option ARM""), are based upon a comparison of the bond’s amortized cost to the NAIC’s loss expectation for each security. Accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality NAIC designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. Prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.As of December 31, 2021, 93% of RMBS securities that are below investment grade as rated by the NRSRO, carry an NAIC 1 (""highest quality"") designation. As of December 31, 2021, Alt-A, Option ARM, Re-Performing and Sub-prime represent 33%, 30%, 14% and 12% of the total RMBS portfolio ($7.7 billion), respectively. Unrealized gains and losses for AFS fixed maturity securitiesGlobal Atlantic's investments in AFS fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes and offsets. Unrealized gains and losses can be created by changes in interest rates or by changes in credit spreads.As of December 31, 2021, Global Atlantic had gross unrealized losses on below investment grade AFS fixed maturity securities of $80.3 million based on NRSRO rating and $13.5 million based on NAIC ratings. Mortgage and other loan receivables - Credit quality indicatorsMortgage and other loan receivables consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans, and other loan receivables. As of December 31, 2021, 23% of Global Atlantic's total investments consisted of mortgage and other loan receivables. Global Atlantic invests in U.S. mortgage loans, comprised of first lien and mezzanine real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and other loan receivables. Global Atlantic's commercial mortgage loans may also be rated based on NAIC designations, with designations “CM1” and “CM2” considered to be investment grade. As of December 31, 2021, 96% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio was rated investment grade based on NAIC designation. 100% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in current status. As of December 31, 2021, 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is in current status, and approximately $202.7 million is over 90 days past due (representing 2% of the total residential mortgage portfolio). The loan-to-value ratio is expressed as a percentage of the current amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying collateral. Approximately 83% of the commercial mortgage loans has a loan-to-value ratio of 70% or less and a 0.3% has loan-to-value ratio over 90%.Changing economic conditions affect Global Atlantic’s valuation of commercial mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that Global Atlantic performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or increase or decrease in) a commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance for losses. In addition, Global Atlantic continuously monitors its commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events, or have deteriorating credit.The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for residential mortgage loans was 68% as of December 31, 2021.182Table of ContentsGlobal Atlantic's residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised mainly of re-performing loans that were purchased at a discount after they were modified and returned to performing status, as well as prime jumbo loans and mortgage loans backed by single family rental properties. Global Atlantic has also extended financing to counterparties in the form of repurchase agreements secured by mortgage loans, including performing and non-performing mortgage loans. Global Atlantic’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of home improvement loans, solar panel loans, student loans and auto loans.Reconciliations to GAAP Measures The following tables reconcile the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to KKR's non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2021December 31, 2020December 31, 2019 ($ in thousands)Total GAAP Revenues$16,236,148 $4,230,891 $4,220,900 Impact of Consolidation and Other808,174 461,244 256,972 Asset Management Adjustments:Capital Allocation-Based Income (GAAP)(6,842,414)(2,224,100)(2,430,425)Realized Carried Interest1,752,130 1,042,204 1,070,788 Realized Investment Income1,613,244 644,659 685,773 Capstone Fees(91,407)(81,452)— Expense Reimbursements(178,572)(149,522)(169,415)Insurance Adjustments:Premiums(2,226,078)— — Policy Fees(1,147,913)— — Other Income(120,213)— — Investment Gains and Losses544,357 — — Derivative Gains and Losses(141,513)— — Total Segment Revenues (1)$10,205,943 $3,923,924 $3,634,593 (1)Total Segment Revenues is comprised of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, (v) Realized Investment Income, and (vi) Net Investment Income.183Table of ContentsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co.

Excludes market condition awards that did not meet their market-price based vesting conditions as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.Liquidity We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by (i) focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and CFEs and the effect of changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year, and (ii) seeking to maintain access to sufficient liquidity through various sources. The overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. Our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and CLOs; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and holders of our preferred stock; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Dividends."" 185Table of ContentsSee ""—Business Environment"" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLOs; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions and funding agreements, including through memberships in Federal Home Loan Banks; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including CLOs and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, committed repurchase agreements, uncommitted financing, and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our equity securities. Many of our investment funds provide carried interest. With respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2021, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. Strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Strategic investor partnerships have longer investment periods and invest in multiple strategies, which may increase the possibility of a 'netting hole,' which will result in less carried interest for us, as well as clawback liabilities"" in this report. As of December 31, 2021, netting holes in excess of $50 million existed at one of our private equity funds, which was Asian Fund II of $415 million. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. We have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. For a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see Note 16 ""Debt Obligations"" in our financial statements.186Table of ContentsLiquidity Needs We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:•continue to support and grow our business lines, including funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, pay the costs related to fundraising and launching of new strategies, and otherwise supporting investment vehicles which we sponsor; •seed or warehouse investments for the benefit of new strategies or funds, including CLOs, pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such funds, and advancing capital to our funds for operational or other needs;•pay interest expense;•service debt obligations, including the payment of obligations upon maturity or redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions;•fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including litigation matters and guarantees; •pay corporate income taxes and other taxes;•pay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance or funding agreement activity;•pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings; •pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock; •underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business, and fund any net capital or regulatory requirements of our capital markets companies;•post or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts;•support and acquire other assets for our Principal Activities business line, including other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy risk retention requirements for CLOs (to the extent they may apply); and •repurchase KKR's common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by KKR.For a discussion of KKR's share repurchase program, see Note 22 ""Equity"" in our financial statements. 187Table of ContentsCapital Commitments The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy for our Principal Activities business line, including core investments and exposure to the Asia-Pacific region.The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds and other vehicles as of December 31, 2021: UncalledCommitmentsPrivate Markets($ in millions)Core Investment Vehicles$4,202 North America Fund XIII1,115 Asian Fund IV818 Real Estate Partners Americas III532 Global Infrastructure Investors IV523 Real Estate Partners Europe II268 Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II262 Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund250 Asia Real Estate Partners209 Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors172 Asian Fund III154 Global Infrastructure Investors III136 Americas Fund XII111 Energy Income and Growth Fund II83 Next Generation Technology Growth II76 European Fund V67 Health Care Strategic Growth Fund59 Global Impact Fund34 Real Estate Credit Opportunity Partners II27 Real Estate Partners Americas II26 Other Private Markets Vehicles1,706 Total Private Markets Commitments10,830 Public MarketsDislocation Opportunities Fund 140 Lending Partners Europe II33 Special Situations Fund II25 Lending Partners III13 Private Credit Opportunities Partners II12 Lending Partners Europe9 Other Public Markets Vehicles884 Total Public Markets Commitments1,116 Total Uncalled Commitments$11,946 188Table of ContentsOther CommitmentsIn addition to the uncalled commitments to our investment funds as shown above, KKR has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and syndications in our capital markets business line. As of December 31, 2021, these commitments amounted to $1.2 billion.Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. Our capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which reduce our risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2021 have been reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third parties. In the case of purchases of investments or assets in our Principal Activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less. For more information about our capital markets business line's risks, see ""Risks Related to Our Business—Our capital markets activities expose us to risks, and our risk management strategy may not be effective or sufficient."" On January 14, 2020, KKR had committed to invest up to an additional $150 million in our India debt finance company to support its alternative credit business in India. No amounts were contributed by KKR, and on September 8, 2021, the commitment was terminated. During the third quarter of 2021, our India debt finance company entered into a transaction to merge with Incred Finance, the consummation of which is still pending.Tax Receivable AgreementWe are required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings, which is expected to result in an increase in our tax basis of the assets of KKR Group Partnership at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires us to pay to KKR Holdings, or to current and former limited partners who have exchanged KKR Holdings units for KKR's common stock as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2021, an undiscounted payable of $399.2 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $50.2 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement.Following the closing of the merger transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, there will be no more exchanges of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings. Additionally, the tax receivable agreement will terminate upon the closing of the mergers contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, except that the obligations of KKR to make payments under the tax receivable agreement will remain outstanding until paid in full for certain exchanges that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. Although our employees who hold restricted holdings units under our 2019 Equity Plan (which includes limited partner interests in KKR Holdings II) will be entitled to exchange those interests for common stock pursuant to the exchange agreement, there will be no payments due for any of those exchanges under the tax receivable agreement. DividendsA dividend of $0.145 per share of our common stock has been declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which will be paid on March 4, 2022 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on February 18, 2022.A dividend of $0.75 per share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been declared and set aside for payment on March 15, 2022 to holders of record of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2022. When KKR & Co. Inc. receives distributions from KKR Group Partnership, other equityholders in KKR Group Partnership including KKR Holdings receive their pro rata share of such distributions from KKR Group Partnership. The declaration and payment of dividends to our common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. We announced on February 8, 2022 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.62 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.155 per share) beginning with the dividend to be announced with the results for the first quarter of 2022. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors based on a number of factors, including KKR’s 189Table of Contentsfuture financial performance and other considerations that the board deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of KKR & Co. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for U.S. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. Furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by KKR Group Partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the terms of the preferred units of KKR Group Partnership.Preferred StockFor a discussion of KKR's equity, including our preferred stock, see Note 22 ""Equity"" in our financial statements.Other Liquidity NeedsFrom time to time, we fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the arranging or underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, for which we may draw all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities. We generally expect these borrowings by our capital markets business to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we (including Global Atlantic) and our consolidated funds and CFEs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. Contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries. 190Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2021 excluding consolidated funds and CFEs with a reconciliation of such amounts to anticipated future cash payments by us (including Global Atlantic) and our consolidated funds and CFEs.

Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Revolving Credit Agreements, Senior Notes, KFN Debt Obligation, KFN Securities and Real Estate Financing—Liquidity Needs.""(2)Amounts include senior notes and subordinated notes issued by KKR and its subsidiaries. KFN's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of KFN.(3)These interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2021, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.(4)Represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. These commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated.(5)Represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities.(6)Represents commitments of KKR's asset management business line including KFN to fund the purchase of various investments.(7)Global Atlantic has other obligations related to collateral payable held for derivative instruments ($1.1 billion) and outstanding commitments to make investments in commercial mortgage loans, other lending facilities and other investments ($2.0 billion) which have not been included in the above table as the exact timing of these payments cannot be estimated. Global Atlantic's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of Global Atlantic.(8)Policy liabilities for insurance obligations consist of amounts required to meet future obligations for future policy benefits and policy account balances. Amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, including significant assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums, mortality, lapse, renewal, withdrawal, and annuitization comparable with actual experience. These assumptions also include market growth and policy crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing DAC. All estimated cash payments are not discounted to present value. Accordingly, the total of cash flows presented for all years of $158.3 billion significantly exceeds total policy liabilities of $126.5 billion recorded on the statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2021. Estimated cash payments are also presented gross of reinsurance. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could differ materially from actual results.(9)The payments due by period for debt obligations reflects the contractual maturities of principal. 191Table of Contents(10)Reflects estimated future interest payments. Future interest on variable rate debt (which includes borrowing under our revolving credit facility and the subordinated debentures) was computed using prevailing rates as of December 31, 2021 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations.(11)Reflects operational servicing agreements with third-party administrators for policy administration.(12)Represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding KKR's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Revolving Credit Agreements, Senior Notes, KFN Debt Obligation, KFN Securities and Real Estate Financing—Liquidity Needs.""(13)Amounts include (i) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of providing liquidity to the funds of $6.9 billion, (ii) debt securities issued by our consolidated CLOs of $21.3 billion and (iii) borrowings collateralized by fund investments, fund co-investments and other assets held by levered investment vehicles of $1.9 billion. Debt securities issued by consolidated CLO entities are supported solely by the investments held at the CLO vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Borrowings by levered investment vehicles are supported solely by the investments held at the investment vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds.(14)Represents a debt obligation in connection with the ownership of KKR office space. (15)The interest obligations on debt of our CFEs and other borrowings represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2021, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement"" in this report and ""Risk Factors—We will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from prior and future exchanges of our common stock for KKR Group Partnership Units and related transactions, and the timing and value of these tax attributes differ from those of our restricted stock units"" in this report. We may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. We enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and covenants, including indemnifications. For example, certain of our investment funds and KKR have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided non-recourse carve-out guarantees for violations of bankruptcy remoteness restrictions and for fraud, willful misconduct and other wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of (i) certain real estate investments that we have made, including KKR's corporate real estate, and (ii) certain investment vehicles we manage or sponsor. KKR has also (i) provided credit support regarding repayment and funding obligations to third-party lenders to certain of its employees, excluding its executive officers, in connection with their personal investments in KKR investment funds and a levered investment vehicle and (ii) provided credit support to one of our hedge fund partnerships. We have also indemnified employees and non-employees against potential liabilities in connection with their services, including as described under ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others"" in this report. In addition, we have also provided credit support to certain of our subsidiaries' obligations in connection with certain investment vehicles or partnerships that we manage. For example, KKR has guaranteed the obligations of a general partner to post collateral on behalf of its investment vehicle in connection with such vehicle's derivative transactions. We expect to continue to guarantee the obligations of one or more of our subsidiaries’ funding obligations to one or more of our investment vehicles, from time to time. KKR has also agreed to cause various of its general partners to fund their capital commitments to their funds and to be liable for such general partners' compliance with certain covenants, including limitations on their incurrence of certain kinds of indebtedness. In addition, we have also agreed for certain of our investment vehicles to fund or otherwise be liable for a portion of certain investment losses, if any, (up to a maximum of approximately $116 million) and/or to provide them with liquidity upon certain termination events (the maximum amount of which is unknown until the scheduled termination date of the investment vehicle). The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds generally include a ""clawback"" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See Note 24 ""Commitments and Contingencies—Contingent Repayment Guarantees"" in our financial statements for further information on KKR's potential clawback obligations.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business.192Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. The following discusses certain aspects of our critical accounting policies. For a full discussion of these and all critical accounting policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies - Asset ManagementRecognition of Investment IncomeInvestment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments; (ii) dividends; (iii) interest income; (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated CFEs.Certain of our investment funds are consolidated. When a fund is consolidated, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated statements of operations. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. However, because certain of our funds remain consolidated and because we hold a minority economic interest in these funds' investments, our share of the investment income is less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated statements of operations for these consolidated funds.Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of OperationsCarried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Carried interest is earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as losses in the statement of operations. For funds that are not consolidated, amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included in capital allocation-based income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest at consolidated funds are eliminated upon consolidation of the fund and are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities along with all of the other investment gains and losses at the consolidated fund.Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Due to the extended durations of our private equity and other funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition.193Table of ContentsBefore carried interest is distributed, KKR calculates whether a preferred return has been achieved based on an amount that includes (i) capital contributions for investments, (ii) net realized investment gains, and (iii) management fees and fund expenses paid by the limited partners. To the extent the fund has exceeded the preferred return at the time of a realization event, and subject to any other conditions that would preclude payment of carried interest to the general partner (e.g. netting holes), carried interest is distributed to the general partner. Until the preferred return is achieved, no carried interest is recorded. Thereafter, the general partner is entitled to a catch up allocation such that the general partner's carried interest is paid in respect of all of the fund's net gains until the general partner has received the full percentage amount of carried interest that the general partner is entitled to under the terms of the fund. The amount ultimately distributed to the general partner as carried interest is calculated as net gains applicable to our limited partners, less all management fees and fund expenses paid to date, multiplied by the applicable carry rate. In general, investment funds that entitle the management company to receive an incentive fee have a preferred return and are calculated on a similar basis that takes into account management fees and expenses paid.Critical Accounting Policies - InsurancePolicy liabilitiesPolicy liabilities (collectively, ""reserves,"") are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. Interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. Global Atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts.Global Atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. These assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), mortality, longevity, and persistency.The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. Global Atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. This would result in a charge to our net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs.For a majority of Global Atlantic's in-force policies, including its universal life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. For these products, the account value represents its obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held on deposit. However, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, universal life products with secondary guarantees, indexed universal life and preneed policies. Guaranteed minimum death benefits (""GMDB"")Some of Global Atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a GMDB feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. This amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. If the GMDB is higher than the current account value at the time of death, Global Atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference.Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (""GMWB"")Global Atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. GMWB are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year.Once exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. A policyholder’s annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. The benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula or index credits. Any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. Global Atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero.194Table of ContentsThe ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. For fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that Global Atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually. GMDB and GMWB sensitivitiesAs of December 31, 2021, the GMDB and GMWB liability balance totaled $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the liability balances for GMDB were $26.7 million for fixed-indexed annuities and $21.6 million for variable annuities. As of December 31, 2021, the liability balances for GMWB were $1.0 billion for fixed-indexed annuities. The increase (decrease) to the GMDB and GMWB liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in projected assessments, equity market prices, and annual equity growth is summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Balance$1,059,108 Hypothetical change:'+10% future assessments(1)(20,373)'-10% future assessments(1)22,718 +10% equity market prices(17,752)-10% equity market prices15,041 1% lower annual equity growth5,428 ________________Note: Hypothetical changes to the liability balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.(1)The assessments used to accrue liabilities are generally based on investment yields, realized gains and losses, rider charges, surrender charges, and asset-based fees, such as mortality and expense fees.Embedded derivativesGlobal Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value.The embedded derivative is calculated as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. In addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect the risk of non-performance on Global Atlantic's obligations (i.e., own credit risk).Changes in interest rates, future index credits, Global Atlantic's own credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life contracts can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative.Valuation of embedded derivatives – Fixed-indexed annuitiesFixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500 Index, or other indexes. The market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. The projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. The projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate increased by a non-performance risk spread tied to Global Atlantic's own credit rating. Valuation of embedded derivatives – Indexed universal lifeIndexed universal life products allow a policyholder’s account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which result in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. The embedded derivative related to the index is 195Table of Contentsbifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. The valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. Present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. The discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate plus a non-performance risk spread tied to Global Atlantic’s own credit rating. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative.Valuation of embedded derivatives – Variable annuitiesVariable annuity contracts offered and assumed by Global Atlantic provide the contractholder with GMDB and/or GMWB. The liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operation. Global Atlantic has issued variable annuity contracts with GMDB features. Global Atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts, valued at $519.5 million as December 31, 2021. Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the GMDB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own company credit risk. Global Atlantic also issues variable annuity contracts with a GMWB. The GMWB feature represents an embedded derivative. The embedded derivative is required to be bifurcated and measured at fair value. This liability is calculated as the present value of the excess GMWB claims less the present value of GMWB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own company credit risk.As of December 31, 2021, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $1,856.1 million for fixed-indexed annuities, $557.3 million for indexed universal life and $127.8 million for variable annuities. As of December 31, 2021, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option was $519.5 million. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity, indexed universal life, and variable annuity products and the increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, non-performance risk premium, and equity market prices is summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.December 31, 2021FIAIULVAVA (FVO)($ in thousands)Balance$1,856,139 $557,276 $127,810 $519,454 Hypothetical change:+50 bps interest rates(43,529)(6,460)(68,075)(34,122)-50 bps interest rates46,062 6,788 78,527 37,211 '+50bps non-performance risk premium(43,529)(6,460)(31,583)(23,038)'-50bps non-performance risk premium46,062 6,788 38,304 24,666 +10% equity market prices387,062 48,486 (48,097)(21,193)-10% equity market prices(300,615)(76,930)64,420 25,869 ________________Note: Hypothetical changes to the liability balances do not reflect the impact of related hedges.Valuation of embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance or funds withheldGlobal Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company’s return on a designated portfolio of assets. Because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value. Global Atlantic is exposed to both the market risk and the credit risk of the assets. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line 196Table of Contentsitems on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations.As of December 31, 2021, the embedded derivative balance for modified coinsurance or funds withheld arrangements was a $81.3 million net asset ($42.2 million in funds withheld receivables at interest, and $(39.1) million in funds withheld payable at interest). The increase (decrease) to the balance as a result of hypothetical changes in credit spreads and interest rates is summarized in the table below.

GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:Level IPricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level IIPricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Level IIIPricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2021 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Level III Valuation MethodologiesOur investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. Additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. Across the total Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core equity investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 50% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of this Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2021, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III private equity investments were 37%, 50%, and 13%, respectively. There is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of Level III investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, KKR will realize the values reflected in our valuations. Our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. See ""—Business Environment"" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III valuations as described above are included in Note 9 ""Fair Value Measurements"" in our financial statements.198Table of ContentsLevel III Valuation ProcessThe valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.For Private Markets investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. KKR begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its Level III assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and KKR follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its Level III assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. These preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations annually for all Level III investments in Private Markets and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of KKR's Level III Private Markets investments. The valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. For credit investments in Public Markets, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by KKR to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as Level III. The valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which KKR's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations. After reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by KKR's valuation committees. As of December 31, 2021, less than 5% of the total value of our Level III credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.For Level III investments in Asset Management, KKR has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. The global valuation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure and credit. The asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary Level III valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. The members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. All Level III valuations for investments in Asset Management are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes one of KKR's Co-Chief Executive Officers and its Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. When valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and are then reported to the Board of Directors.Level III investments held by Global Atlantic are valued on the basis of pricing services, reputable broker-dealers or internal models. Global Atlantic performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from independent pricing services as well as broker-dealers to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. For all the internally developed models, Global Atlantic seeks to verify the reasonableness of fair values by analyzing the inputs and other assumptions used. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 62% of these investments were priced via external sources, while approximately 38% were valued on the basis of internal models. When valuations are approved by Global Atlantic's management, the valuations of its Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and are then reported to the Board of Directors.As of December 31, 2021, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain Level III investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR (including Global Atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. There were no changes made to our Level III valuation process as a result of COVID-19.199Table of ContentsAs described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.Changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in Asset Management and through our consolidated funds as described below. We estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. With respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments. With respect to Insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact KKR only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in Global Atlantic.As of December 31, 2021, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, as of December 31, 2021, investments which represented greater than 5% of total non-GAAP investments consisted of PetVet Care Centers, LLC and USI, Inc. valued at $1,216.1 million and $1,094.1 million, respectively. Our investment income on a GAAP basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of Fiserv, Inc. and BridgeBio Pharma Inc. See ""—Business Environment"" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results and valuations, and ""—Non-GAAP Balance Sheet Measures"" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a non-GAAP basis.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsFor a full discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements.200Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to movements in the fair value of investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest, and net gains from investment activities. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Additionally, interest rate movements can adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive on credit instruments bearing variable rates and could also impact the amount of interest that we pay on debt obligations bearing variable rates. Following our acquisition of Global Atlantic, we expect to be affected by market risks arising from Global Atlantic’s business. Global Atlantic has material exposure to market volatility in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices through its insurance liabilities, many of which are structured to have exposure to market level changes, its investment portfolio and its hedge program. The quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate. The actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below. Management of Market Risk The firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks. Asset Management When we commit capital from our Principal Activities business line to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our Co-Executive Chairmen, one of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, and the Chief Financial Officer, must approve the investment or transaction before it may be made. The committee has delegated authority to other senior employees to approve certain investments or transactions, subject to maximum commitment sizes or other limitations determined by the committee. In addition, this committee supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and the composition of our balance sheet. Certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements, and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Exchange Act. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example, and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk and capital deployed for transactions are monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above. With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee or portfolio manager; a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) then regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data, and other information relevant to a particular investment. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee or a portfolio manager, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis. Insurance The board of directors of TGAFG, which is the holding company for Global Atlantic, has established a risk committee that has primary oversight of market risk at Global Atlantic. This risk committee has adopted Global Atlantic’s risk appetite principles that form the foundation of Global Atlantic’s enterprise risk management program. The risk appetite principles include: (1) protect policyholders by seeking to maintain adequate capital and liquidity resources to honor its obligations to policyholders under situations reflecting stress scenarios calibrated to the worst modern economic cycles; (2) deliver value by remaining in a position of strength during periods of adverse market conditions, and (3) protect the franchise by identifying and cost-effectively managing risks that could adversely and materially impact franchise value. The Global Atlantic enterprise risk management program formalizes the review of financial and non-financial risks and establishes risk management controls. Global Atlantic monitors risks on an aggregate, legal entity and product basis, monitoring different factors, including financial and insurance, investment, hedge management, operational, and legal, compliance and regulatory risks to confirm that its risks remain within established risk limits and tolerances. For a discussion of Global Atlantic's hedge program, see ""—Insurance Segment Market Risks—Hedge Program"".201Table of ContentsManagement of General Business Risk Asset Management KKR has an investment management and distribution committee comprised of senior employees across our Asset Management business lines, and it includes our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer. The investment management and distribution committee focuses on coordinating investment and distribution activities across the firm. KKR has a risk and operations committee comprised of senior employees from across our Asset Management business and operations, and it includes our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. The risk and operations committee focuses on KKR's operations and enterprise risk management. This committee is aided by various other committees focused on the oversight of risks to our business, including a global conflicts and compliance committee and a technology and information security committee. KKR's global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including conflicts relating to specific transactions as well as potential conflicts involving the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses. This committee also reviews and monitors certain compliance matters. Our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer are included as members of this committee. KKR's technology and information security committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring global technology risks including information security, business disruption and fraud related risks. Insurance The TGAFG board of directors is responsible for oversight and the overall governance of Global Atlantic's business and operations. The TGAFG board includes among its members our Co-Chief Executive Officers. To assist with its oversight of Global Atlantic, the TGAFG board of directors has established an audit, risk, investment, operations & technology, nominating & governance, compensation and special transaction review committee. Asset Management Segment Market Risks The following is a discussion of the significant market risk exposures for KKR's Asset Management business. Changes in Fair Value The majority of our investments as of December 31, 2021, are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on investments held as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a significant portion of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the consolidated statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations, (ii) the elimination of management fees and carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs, and (iii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs. Based on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2022 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors:202Table of ContentsManagement FeesCarried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)10% Decline in Fair Value of Investments (1)$33,959 (2)$685,824 (3)$1,236,343 (3)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at December 31st or September 30th of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees may have been earned.(2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees.(3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored. Management Fees Our management fees in our Private Markets business line are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Business Lines—Private Markets."" Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not significantly affect the amount of fees we may charge in Private Markets funds. Management fees in our infrastructure funds are calculated based on the net asset value (""NAV"") of the fund and, in some cases, we additionally earn management fees on the fund's remaining commitment. In the case of our Public Markets business line, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund for that particular period, although certain funds in our Public Markets business line have management fees based on the amount of capital invested. In the case of our CLO vehicles, management fees are calculated based on the collateral of the vehicle. The collateral is based on the par value of the investments and cash on hand. To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will increase or decrease in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fund management fees that were recognized based on the NAV of the applicable funds was approximately 24%. Publicly Traded Securities Our investment funds and KKR's balance sheet hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions, and dispositions. In addition, although a substantial portion of our investments are comprised of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these privately held investments may also fluctuate as our Level III investments are valued in part using a market comparables analysis. Consequently, due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded, the value of these Level III investments may fluctuate with market prices. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Environment."" Exchange Rate Risk Our investment funds, CLO vehicles, and KKR's balance sheet hold investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. 203Table of Contents Our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (including euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, among others), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the inclusion of amounts attributable to KKR Holdings in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations, (ii) the elimination of carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds, and (iii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CLO vehicles. We estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as of December 31, 2021 (i.e., an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies) would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2022 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors: Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)10% Decline in Foreign Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar (1)$183,349 (2)$151,497 (2)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would not be expected to materially impact our management fees or incentive fees. The majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, our management fees that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies are generally hedged.(2)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.Interest Rate Risk Valuation of Investments Changes in credit markets and in particular, interest rates, can impact investment valuations, particularly our Level III investments, and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. Interest Income We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, hold credit investments that generate interest income based on variable interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to investments that generate yield since a meaningful portion of credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds, including CLOs, earn income based on variable interest rates. However, the contractual interest rate structure for a large portion of our credit investments bearing variable rates have ""floors,"" which establish a minimum rate of interest that will be earned. In the current low interest rate environment, a large portion of the credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds, including CLOs, are earning interest marginally above the contractual floor and therefore, for these investments, a decrease in variable interest rates would not materially impact the amount of interest income earned. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material since (i) many variable rate credit investments are subject to floors as described above and (ii) a substantial portion of this decrease would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. 204Table of Contents Interest Expense We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements, certain investment financing arrangements and debt securities issued by CLO vehicles that accrue interest at variable rates. Changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that our consolidated funds, including CLOs, would have to make. With respect to consolidated funds and CLOs, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this increase would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. With respect to debt obligations held by KKR and not in the consolidated funds or CLOs, as of December 31, 2021, KKR had debt obligations outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $258.5 million that accrues interest at a variable rate. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using interest rate swaps. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense, net of the impact of interest rate hedging strategies, would not be expected to be material. Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to reduce our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.205Table of ContentsInsurance Segment Market RisksThe following is a discussion of the significant market risk exposures for Global Atlantic.Hedge ProgramTo manage market risk, Global Atlantic established a hedge program that seeks to mitigate economic impacts primarily from interest rate and equity price movements, while taking into consideration accounting and capital impacts. For Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to use static hedges to offset the exposure primarily created by changes in embedded derivative balances. For Global Atlantic's variable policies, including variable annuity policies and variable universal life policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to dynamically hedge its exposure to changes in the value of the guarantee Global Atlantic provides to policyholders. In the context of specific reinsurance or other transactions in Global Atlantic's institutional channel or strategic acquisitions, Global Atlantic may also enters into hedges which are designed to limit short-term market risks to the economic value of the target assets. From time to time, Global Atlantic also enters into hedges designed to limit the volatility associated with changes in the value of its general account assets or changes to net investment income as a result of interest rate or credit spread movements, while also taking into consideration economic impacts. While not the primary focus of its hedging strategy, Global Atlantic also enters into currency swaps and forwards to manage foreign exchange rate risks with respect to certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. Global Atlantic also enters into inflation swaps to manage inflation risk associated with inflation-indexed preneed policies. Where Global Atlantic has derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, these derivative instruments receive hedge accounting.Global Atlantic's hedge program is not designed to, and may not be effective in, offsetting all impacts to net income, assets under management, statutory capital or economic values. Movements in market variables other than interest rates and equity market prices that are not explicitly hedged can also cause net income volatility. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Global Atlantic's use of derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy may not be effective or sufficient."" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Global Atlantic may experience volatility in its net income under GAAP due to its funds withheld coinsurance transactions"" in this report.SensitivitiesGlobal Atlantic evaluates the sensitivity of net income to specific changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices projected using internal models. All of the estimated sensitivities assume that all other factors remain constant and reflect the impact of related hedges assuming no hedge rebalancing in Global Atlantic's dynamic program, as explained further below.Global Atlantic's internal models project impacts as of a specific date, and are measured relative to a starting level reflecting its assets and liabilities at that date and the actuarial factors, investment activity, and assumed investment returns associated with insurance liabilities. The models measure the impact of changing one factor at a time and assume that all other factors remain unchanged. Actual results can differ significantly from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including the interaction among these factors when more than one changes, discretionary actions by management in response to such changes, differences between the return of the underlying fund and the return on the index being hedged, actual experience differing from the assumptions, changes in business mix, effective tax rates and other market factors, and limitations inherent in the use of models. For these reasons, the sensitivities should only be viewed as directional estimates of the impacts on Global Atlantic's net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI""), and actual changes in response to such scenarios may differ materially from estimates provided.For the dynamic portion of the hedge program, Global Atlantic primarily uses interest rate and equity futures to hedge liabilities which have option-like embedded derivatives. As such, Global Atlantic's program requires frequent rebalancing as markets move to ensure that the hedges are being re-sized to the new liability exposure. In addition, certain of the underlying variable annuity separate account funds are managed volatility funds, so Global Atlantic's market exposures may change substantially after sharp market moves. The point-in-time estimates provided in this section assume no hedge rebalancing and, as such, the impact on Global Atlantic's consolidated net income may be different from what is shown below.206Table of ContentsInterest rate riskGlobal Atlantic is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in the level and volatility of interest rates. Changes in the level and volatility of interest rates primarily impacts the fair value reported in our consolidated financial statements of the following:•embedded derivatives associated with modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld payables or receivables; •embedded derivatives associated with variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities and indexed universal life products; •policy liabilities accounted under the fair value option, and•financial instruments held in Global Atlantic's investment portfolio and used in its hedge program.Changes in fair value of the foregoing are generally recorded as gains or losses in the consolidated statement of operations. For specific derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted bond purchases and receiving hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to net investment income following the qualifying purchases of available-for-sale securities, as an adjustment to the yield earned over the life of the purchased securities, using the effective interest method.Due to the dynamic lapse sensitivities within Global Atlantic's models, market volatility in interest rates also impacts the reserves and deferred acquisition costs of certain fixed annuity products, changes in which are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.In periods following interest rate moves, Global Atlantic will also recognize a change in the income earned on certain of its floating-rate assets and the cost of funding on certain of Global Atlantic's liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.Effect of interest rate sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 50 basis point increase/(decrease) in interest rates, from a parallel shift in the yield curve, from levels as of December 31, 2021 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. These sensitivities include the impact of related hedges and adjustments to DAC attributable to interest rate changes.

Estimated sensitivity to a hypothetical change over 12 months does not take into account any management actions that may be taken to mitigate actual impacts.The estimated point in time impact is driven by a net decrease/(increase) in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with Global Atlantic's modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld payables and receivables and the embedded derivatives associated with its variable annuity, fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life products, and largely offset by a loss/(gain) in financial instruments used in its hedging program, investments classified as trading, and loans designated under the fair value option, based on balances in place at quarter end. These estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts. In addition, the point in time impact includes a decrease/(increase) in the value of the reserve and (decrease)/increase in the deferred acquisition cost balance of certain fixed annuity blocks of business due to the dynamic lapse sensitivities within Global Atlantic's models.The impact over 12 months is driven by an increase/(decrease) in the income earned on Global Atlantic's floating rate assets, and partially offset by an increase/(decrease) in the cost of its floating-rate liabilities.207Table of ContentsIn the table below we estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase/(decrease) in interest rates, for a parallel shift in the yield curve, from levels as of December 31, 2021 to Global Atlantic's AOCI.December 31, 2021Hypothetical change(1)+50 Basis points-50 Basis points($ in thousands)Total estimated AOCI sensitivity (point in time)$(1,767,222)$1,768,655 The estimated point in time impact is driven by a net (decrease)/increase in the value of Global Atlantic's available-for-sale fixed maturity securities which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of certain offsets, reported in AOCI. The estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts.Credit spread riskGlobal Atlantic is exposed to credit spread risk as a result of changes in the spread between the yields on its funds withheld payables and receivables at interest and yields on comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Global Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance arrangements. Such arrangements are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value, and are therefore impacted by the mark-to-market value of the related assets. Changes in the credit spreads associated with the assets impact the mark-to-market value of the assets. There is additional credit spread risk exposure inherent in Global Atlantic's own credit spread used in valuing embedded derivative liabilities, which serves to mitigate net credit exposure. Global Atlantic may choose to enter into hedge positions to manage credit spread risk. As of December 31, 2021, Global Atlantic had a $1.5 million credit derivative position.Effect of credit spread sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 50 basis points increase/(decrease) in credit spreads from levels as of December 31, 2021 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI.

These changes impact our net income over the periods following equity price moves.Effect of equity price sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 10% increase/(decrease) in equity prices from levels as of December 31, 2021 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI.

Estimated sensitivity to a hypothetical change over 12 months does not take into account any management actions that may be taken to mitigate actual impacts. The estimated point-in-time impact is driven by an increase/(decrease) in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life products, and largely offset by a decrease / (increase) in Global Atlantic's variable annuity embedded derivatives and policy benefits, and gains or losses on financial instruments used in Global Atlantic's hedging program. These estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts.For a discussion of current market conditions, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Environment."" 209Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:24:03.221568

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors."" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Business EnvironmentEconomic and Market ConditionsOur asset management and insurance businesses are materially affected by the economic conditions of, and financial markets in, the United States, the EU, China, Japan, and other countries. Global and regional economic conditions can each have substantial impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in various ways, including the valuations of our investments, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments. Economic ConditionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, many countries and regions, including the United States, showed signs of slowing economic activity, potentially indicating the early stages of a recession. Economic activity began to be adversely impacted by the effects of monetary and fiscal policy tightening as years of fiscal stimulus from governments and accommodative monetary policy from global central banks began to wane as central banks took measures to combat significant inflationary pressures at multi-decade highs in many major economies around the world. Inflation presented a headwind for many country and regional economies in which we operate. The Federal Reserve Board has continued to raise interest rates and has indicated that it is prepared to take decisive action to manage inflation, including raising interest rates further and shrinking the size of its balance sheet. As a result of these and other actions by central banks, overall macro conditions began to transition by the fourth quarter of 2022 with less focus on inflation’s impact on repricing capital markets and moving towards a period where high rates and inflation began to put significant pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets. By year-end 2022, inflation began to show signs of peaking on a year-over-year basis in the U.S. and in certain other regions, but remained elevated in absolute terms.Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. Areas that have central bank quantitative easing or tightening campaigns affecting their interest rates relative to the United States could potentially experience further currency volatility relative to the U.S. dollar. Relatedly, foreign exchange rates are often affected by countries’ monetary and fiscal responses to inflationary trends. Foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. Labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, work stoppages and increasing labor costs can also adversely impact us and the assets we manage. Despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment have demonstrated resilience in 2022.During 2022, the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to these significant inflationary pressures. Various supply bottlenecks ranging from dynamic zero-COVID policy to shifting Russia-Ukraine supply chains to U.S. domestic semiconductor industry output shortages as a result of restrictions on trade with Chinese semiconductor companies contributed to inflationary pressure throughout much of 2022. In the United States and many other countries, laws designed to protect national security or to restrict foreign direct investment continued to proliferate in 2022, which adversely affected the business and investment environments in various ways. These and related concerns, such as rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty in countries such as China, Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, contributed to substantial market volatility, equity and credit market declines and increased pressures on labor supply. In the Eurozone, disruptions to European energy markets and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine adversely affected the business environment. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have exacerbated and may further exacerbate these issues and trends globally, including by increasing oil and gas prices and price volatility. Protectionist policies, such as restrictions on exports of food, have also increased globally as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As of December 31, 2022, we have no investments in any portfolio companies whose executive 132Table of Contentsheadquarters are located in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus, and we believe that the direct exposure of our investment portfolio to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is insignificant. In addition, the Chinese economy experienced headwinds related to the ongoing slowdown in China’s property sector and the effects of the government’s zero-COVID policies. In Japan, the economic recovery from COVID-19 continued, despite higher energy costs and significant volatility in currency markets.Several relevant key economic indicators in the U.S. and in other countries and areas in which our business operates include: •Inflation. The U.S. core consumer price index rose 5.7% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2022, up from 5.5% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021. Core inflation in China was 0.7% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2022, down from 1.2% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021. In Japan, core inflation rose to 1.6% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2022, up from -1.3% on a year-over-year basis as of December 31, 2021. Euro Area core inflation was 5.2% as of December 31, 2022, up from 2.6% as of December 31, 2021.•Interest Rates. The effective federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve Board was 4.33% as of December 31, 2022, up from 0.1% as of December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points in November, and 50 basis points in December, leading to increased market volatility. The short-term benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of Japan was -0.1% as of December 31, 2022, unchanged from December 31, 2021. The short-term benchmark interest rate set by the European Central Bank was 2.5% as of December 31, 2022, up from 0.0% as of December 31, 2021.•GDP. In the United States, real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an expansion of 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Real GDP in China is estimated to have increased by 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to growth of 8.4% reported for the year ended December 31, 2021. In Japan, real GDP growth for the year ended December 31, 2022, is estimated to have been 1.3%, down from 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Euro Area real GDP growth was 3.2% as of December 31, 2022, up from 5.3% as of December 31, 2021.•Unemployment. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.5% as of December 31, 2022, down from 3.9% as of December 31, 2021. The unemployment rate in China was 5.5% as of December 31, 2022, up from 5.1% as of December 31, 2021. The unemployment rate in Japan was 2.5% as of December 31, 2022, down from 2.7% as of December 31, 2021. In addition, Euro Area unemployment was 6.5% as of December 31, 2022, up from 7.0% as of December 31, 2021.Market ConditionsEquity, credit, commodity and foreign exchange markets in the United States and in other countries and areas in which we have made investments each can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In our asset management segment, many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. Volatility across global equity and credit markets, alongside shifting liquidity conditions in new issue activity across equity and non-investment grade credit markets, have adversely impacted (and may continue to adversely impact) our financial results and the volume of capital markets activity, the level of transaction fees that our Capital Markets business line is able to earn, the valuation of our portfolio companies, the investment income that we recognize and our ability to deploy our, and our funds', capital. For our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity market price declines had (and may continue to have) a direct impact on valuation. For many other of our investments, these markets had an indirect materially adverse impact on many of our investment valuations as we typically utilize market multiples as a critical input to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, many of our investments are in non-investment grade credit instruments and investment grade credit instruments. Many of our funds invest or have the flexibility to invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the United States. A substantial amount of these investments consist of private equity investments made by our private equity funds. For example, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 50% of the capital invested in those funds was attributable to non-U.S. investments. In our insurance business, a change in equity prices also impacts Global Atlantic’s equity-sensitive annuity and life insurance products, including with respect to hedging costs related to and fee-income earned on those products. Our funds, our portfolio companies and Global Atlantic also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. Consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have 133Table of Contentsinvested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. Tightening liquidity conditions in equity and credit capital markets affect the availability and cost of capital for us and our portfolio companies, and the increased cost of credit or degradation in debt financing terms may impact our ability to identify and execute investments on attractive terms. In our insurance segment, periods of rising or higher interest rates as we are currently experiencing may result in differing impacts on Global Atlantic’s business. Periods of rising or higher interest rates can benefit Global Atlantic’s results of operations and financial condition, as we generally expect the yield on new investment purchases and income from any floating rate investments held in Global Atlantic’s investment portfolio to increase as interest rates rise. Higher interest rates also generally tend to increase the demand for certain of Global Atlantic’s products, as the benefits and solutions Global Atlantic can offer to clients may become more attractive, potentially resulting in higher new business volumes. Rising rates are also expected to result in decreases to certain policy liabilities as a result of new accounting guidance which we adopted effective January 1, 2023 (with a transition date of January 1, 2021) for insurance companies that issue or reinsure long-duration contracts such as life insurance and annuities. For a further discussion of this guidance, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Future application of accounting standards"" in our financial statements.Higher interest rates can also have a negative impact on Global Atlantic. For example, higher policyholder surrenders may occur in response to rising interest rates as more attractive products become available to policyholders in a higher rate environment. The majority of our investments at Global Atlantic are in investment grade credit instruments. Sales of those investments at a loss, for example to raise cash to meet policyholder obligations upon surrender earlier than expected maturity or as we rotate out of investments acquired with new reinsurance transactions to our desired asset mix during a period of rising or higher rates compared to when the investment was acquired, is expected to decrease our net income in that period and such decrease could be significant. We also expect that in a higher rate environment we will generally have a higher cost of insurance on new business, including higher hedging costs, as the benefits to policyholders on new business will be generally higher. If Global Atlantic fails to adequately cash flow match liabilities sold with higher benefits and interest rates fall while Global Atlantic holds that liability, Global Atlantic may not generate its expected earnings on those liabilities. In addition, rising interest rates will decrease the fair value of Global Atlantic’s credit investments and the value of embedded derivatives associated with funds withheld reinsurance transactions. Global Atlantic expects that substantially all of its unrealized losses will not be realized as it intends to hold these investments until recovery of the losses, which may be at maturity, as part of its asset liability cash-flow matching strategy. However, if the market, industry and company-specific factors relating to these investments deteriorate meaningfully, Global Atlantic may be required to recognize an impairment to goodwill and may realize losses as a result of credit defaults or impairments on investments, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, commodity prices are generally expected to rise in inflationary environments. Our Real Assets business line portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit and Liquid Strategies business line strategies have investments in or related to the energy sector. The value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. As noted above, the actions taken by Russia in the Ukraine starting in February 2022 have caused volatility in the commodities markets. To the extent energy real asset investments are directly held by our balance sheet, price movements can have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses, subject to hedging.Although the recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants and the resulting price volatility of crypto assets have caused widespread disruption in those markets, as of December 31, 2022, these events have had no material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Neither we through our balance sheet, nor the limited partner funds we manage, have material direct exposure to crypto asset market participants that we are aware of that have: commenced insolvency, receivership, reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings; experienced excessive redemptions or suspended redemptions or withdrawals of crypto assets; the crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for; or experienced material corporate compliance failures. While, to date, our business has only minimal crypto exposure, the level of exposure may shift over time, and we cannot predict the broader impact, including to us, of the recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants and coverage of new regulatory developments related to crypto assets and crypto asset markets.Several relevant key market indicators in the U.S. and in other countries and areas which constitute our business environment include: •Equity Markets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, global equity markets were negative, with the S&P 500 down 18.1% and the MSCI World Index down 17.7% on a total return basis including dividends. Equity market volatility as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of volatility, ended at 21.7 as of December 31, 2022, increasing from 17.2 as of December 31, 2021.134Table of Contents•Credit Markets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, U.S. investment grade corporate bond spreads (BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index) widened by 40 basis points and U.S. high-yield corporate bond spreads (BofAML HY Master II Index) widened by 171 basis points. The non-investment grade credit indices were down during the year ended December 31, 2022, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index down 0.6% and the BAML US High Yield Index down 11.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 10-year government bond yields rose 236 basis points in the United States, rose 6 basis points in China, rose 35 basis points in Japan, rose 270 basis points in the UK and rose 275 basis points in Germany.•Commodity Markets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the 3-year forward price of WTI crude oil increased approximately 11.3%, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased from approximately $3.43 per MMBtu to $4.99 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. The Japan spot LNG import price decreased to approximately $28.46 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2022 from approximately $31.26 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2021.•Foreign Exchange Rates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the euro fell 5.8%, the British pound 10.7%, the Japanese yen 12.2%, and the Chinese renminbi fell 7.9%, respectively, relative to the U.S. dollar. Other Trends, Uncertainties and Risks Related to Our BusinessPlease refer to the ""Risk Factors"" section of this report for important additional detail regarding the known trends or uncertainties and competitive conditions that have had or that are reasonably likely to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on our businesses, including the impact of economic and market conditions on valuations of investments. These known trends, uncertainties and competitive conditions should be read in conjunction with this Business Environment section and the entire Risk Factor section.Basis of Accounting and Key Financial Measures under GAAPWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See Note 2 “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our financial statements and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in this section below. Our key Segment and non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics are discussed below. Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures The following key segment and non-GAAP performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of KKR's business. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of exchangeable securities and as such represent the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and collateralized financing entities (""CFEs"") that KKR manages.We believe that providing these segment and non-GAAP performance measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable are included under ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures—Reconciliations to GAAP Measures.""After-tax Distributable EarningsAfter-tax distributable earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure of KKR’s earnings, which is derived from KKR’s reported segment results. After-tax distributable earnings is used to assess the performance of KKR’s business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. After-tax distributable earnings is equal to Distributable Operating Earnings less Interest Expense, Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Income Taxes Paid. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends have been excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings, because the definition of Adjusted Shares used to calculate After-tax Distributable Earnings per Adjusted Share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Income Taxes Paid represents the amount of income taxes that 135Table of Contentswould be paid assuming that all pre-tax distributable earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. were exchanged. Income Taxes Paid includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces income taxes paid or payable during the period. Equity based compensation expense is excluded from After-tax Distributable Earnings, because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR’s reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in KKR’s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor’s ability to compare KKR’s performance to these other companies. If tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes Paid, KKR’s After-tax Distributable Earnings would be lower and KKR’s effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in After-tax Distributable Earnings for the period. KKR makes these adjustments when calculating After-tax Distributable Earnings in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to KKR’s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR’s business. However, After-tax Distributable Earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR’s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and After-tax Distributable Earnings should not be viewed as a measure of KKR’s liquidity.Book ValueBook Value is a non-GAAP performance measure of the net assets of KKR and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of KKR’s net assets presented on a basis that (i) deconsolidates KKR’s investment funds and CFEs that KKR manages, (ii) includes the net assets that are attributable to certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc., and (iii) includes KKR’s ownership of the net assets of Global Atlantic. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the net assets of KKR excluding those net assets that are allocated to investors in KKR’s investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders. KKR's book value includes the net impact of KKR's tax assets and liabilities as calculated under GAAP. Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been included in book value, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes that all shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted to shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. To calculate Global Atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in Global Atlantic’s industry, Global Atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of deferred acquisition costs and income tax.Distributable Operating EarningsDistributable operating earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure that KKR believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Distributable Operating Earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges and (iv) non-recurring items, if any. Strategic corporate transaction-related items arise from corporate actions and consist primarily of (i) impairments, (ii) non-monetary gains or losses on divestitures, (iii) transaction costs from strategic acquisitions, and (iv) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by KKR as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies and (ii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where one or more KKR subsidiaries borrow from a Global Atlantic insurance subsidiary. Inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the definitive documents that contain arms' length terms and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Distributable Operating Earnings represents operating earnings of KKR’s Asset Management and Insurance segments, which are comprised of the following:•Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized carried interest, (ii) net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, and (iii) related unrealized carried interest compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including Global Atlantic insurance companies, are included in Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings.136Table of Contents•Insurance Segment Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses, (iv) Income Taxes, and (v) Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The non-operating adjustments made to derive Insurance Segment Operating Earnings exclude the impact of: (i) realized (gains) losses related to asset/liability matching investments strategies, (ii) unrealized investment (gains) losses, (iii) changes in the fair value of derivatives, embedded derivatives, and fair value liabilities for fixed-indexed annuities, indexed universal life contracts and variable annuities, and (iv) the associated income tax effects of all exclusions from Insurance Segment Operating Earnings except for equity-based compensation expense. Insurance Segment Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investments strategies and (ii) the investment management fee expenses that are earned by KKR as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies.Fee Related EarningsFee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the Asset Management segment’s generation of profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on future realization events. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of KKR’s fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses and other recurring revenue streams. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees paid by the Insurance segment to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by certain insurance co-investment vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y) Other Operating Expenses.•Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Incentive Fees from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Fee-related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.•Fee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues.•Other Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses.Total Asset Management Segment Revenues Total Asset Management Segment Revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the Asset Management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized net gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income. KKR believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the realized revenues generated by KKR's asset management segment.Other Terms and Capital MetricsAdjusted SharesAdjusted shares represents shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. outstanding under GAAP adjusted to include (i) the number of shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. assumed to be issuable upon conversion of the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Weighted average adjusted shares is used in the calculation of After-tax Distributable Earnings per Adjusted Share, and Adjusted Shares is used in the calculation of Book Value per Adjusted Share.Assets Under ManagementAssets under management represent the assets managed, advised or sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including 137Table of Contentsuncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the Global Atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-U.S. real estate investment trusts; and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR’s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity’s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.Capital InvestedCapital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR’s investment funds and Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR’s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR’s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR’s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR’s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR’s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested.Fee Paying AUMFee paying AUM represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate KKR's and its hedge fund and BDC partnership management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.Uncalled CommitmentsUncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR’s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. The amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund’s subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR’s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.138Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

This increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from European Fund V and Americas Fund XII as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate.Management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings."" Fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees from infrastructure transaction fee-generating investments in our Real Asset business line. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit.141Table of ContentsCapital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was negative primarily due to the net depreciation of the underlying investments in many of our carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund II, and Asian Fund III. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III, and North America Fund XI.KKR calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.Investment Income (Loss) - Asset ManagementNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2022The net losses from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were comprised of net realized gains of $1,298.5 million and net unrealized losses of $(2,964.0) million.Investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) as described above. Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), which was a significant contributor to gains from investment activities in 2022 but has now been completely sold and will no longer contribute to gains from investment activities, (ii) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the sale of real estate investments held in certain consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) various investments held in our consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) a realized loss on Magneti Marelli CK Holdings (industrials sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) realized losses from the sales of revolving credit facilities. Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by mark-to-market losses from (i) investments held in our consolidated CLOs and in certain consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) OutSystems Holdings S.A. (technology sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. These unrealized losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains related to (i) investments held in certain consolidated energy funds, (ii) USI, Inc. (financial services sector), and (iii) ERM Worldwide Group Limited (services sector).The extent and the factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. For the year ended December 31, 2022 net unrealized losses were primarily generated in the following asset classes:•Private equity (excluding core private equity), which was primarily impacted by (i) the negative returns of global equity markets and the related reduction of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of Level III investments, and (ii) the negative impact of higher interest rates and a higher market risk premium in 2022 on discount rates used in the discounted cash flow methodology for the valuation of Level III investments; •Credit, which were primarily impacted by the widening of the credit spreads observed in the credit markets in 2022; and 142Table of Contents•Real estate, which, notwithstanding the positive operating performance of certain properties, was negatively impacted by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and the capitalization rates widening in the fourth quarter of 2022.Partially offsetting the losses in the asset classes above, there were the unrealized gains generated in the following asset classes: •Infrastructure and energy, which benefited from (i) higher oil and gas prices and (ii) the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets; and •Core private equity, which benefited from the positive operating performance of its portfolio companies. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"".Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2021The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million.Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net realized gains related primarily to the sales of investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were in FanDuel Inc. (technology sector), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ: COOP), and Darktrace Limited (LSE: DARK). Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses from various investments held in our consolidated credit funds and realized losses on certain hedging instruments.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net unrealized gains related primarily to mark-to-market gains from investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC (health care sector), Heartland Dental LLC (health care sector) and OutSystems Holdings S.A. Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses, the most significant of which were (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and (ii) an unrealized loss on BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBIO).For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"". For additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see Note 5 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Dividend IncomeDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the most significant dividends received included (i) $441.2 million from investments held in our consolidated core plus and opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) $86.6 million from our investment in Exact Group B.V. (technology sector) held in our consolidated core vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the most significant dividends received included (i) $215.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds, (ii) $138.7 million from our investment in Viridor Limited (Infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector), and (iii) $70.9 million from our investment in Arnott's Biscuits Limited (consumer products sector).Significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results."" Interest IncomeThe increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the (i) impact of closing additional CLOs that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on assets held in consolidated CLOs and (ii) a higher level of interest income from investments held in certain of our consolidated alternative credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed and higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""143Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to (i) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from consolidated funds and other vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing additional CLOs that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on debt obligations held in consolidated CLOs, and (iii) the impact of issuances of our notes after December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""Expenses - Asset ManagementCompensation and Benefits Expenses The decrease in compensation and benefits expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized accrued carried interest, partially offset by (i) higher equity-based compensation charges and (ii) a higher level of discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of segment fee related revenue and realized performance income in the current period.General, Administrative and OtherThe increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a higher level of (i) expenses at our consolidated funds and investment vehicles, (ii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges, (iii) professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm, and (iv) travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.In periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other are expected to increase accordingly. Similarly, our General, Administrative and Other expenses are expected to increase as a result of increased levels of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development.Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) - InsuranceFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the results of Global Atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, February 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021. Assumption reviewThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities or an increase in deferred expenses, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.144Table of ContentsThe following table reflects the impact on net income by financial statement line item and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from Global Atlantic’s assumption review:Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Impacts of assumption review, by statement of income line item:Policy fees$(14)$182 $(196)Policy benefits and claims(23,079)20,904 (43,983)Amortization of policy acquisition costs7,686 (2,119)9,805 Income tax impact3,236 (3,983)7,219 Total assumption review impact on net income$(12,171)$14,984 $(27,155)Assumption review impact on adjustments to derive insurance segment adjusted operating earnings(157)(97)(60)Noncontrolling interests' share of assumption review impact4,749 (5,734)10,483 Total assumption review impact on insurance segment adjusted operating earnings$(7,579)$9,153 $(16,732)For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net unfavorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in expected future surrender experience of annuity policies, partially as a result of higher interest rates, and a decrease in expected future surrender experience of life insurance policies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net favorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to lower expected future mortality rates.RevenuesFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Net Premiums$1,182,461 $2,226,078 $(1,043,617)Policy Fees1,278,736 1,147,913 130,823 Net Investment Income4,118,246 2,845,623 1,272,623 Net Investment-Related Gains(1,318,490)203,753 (1,522,243)Other Income139,124 120,213 18,911 Total Insurance Revenues$5,400,077 $6,543,580 $(1,143,503)Net PremiumsNet premiums decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to lower initial premiums related to fewer reinsurance transactions with life contingencies assumed during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was partially offset by lower retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).Policy feesPolicy fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition on February 1, 2021.145Table of ContentsNet investment incomeNet investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) higher yields on floating-rate investments due to higher market interest rates, (ii) rotation into higher yielding assets, (iii) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in our institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales, and (iv) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021.Net investment-related lossesThe components of net investment-related losses were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Funds withheld payable embedded derivatives$3,448,710 $49,491 $3,399,219 Equity futures contracts167,924 (263,637)431,561 Foreign currency forwards18,929 2,484 16,445 Credit risk contracts(108)(400)292 Equity index options(895,602)549,987 (1,445,589)Interest rate contracts(333,937)(146,920)(187,017)Funds withheld receivable embedded derivatives(29,390)31,740 (61,130)Other(29,779)— (29,779)Net gains on derivative instruments2,346,747 222,745 2,124,002 Net other investment losses(3,665,237)(18,992)(3,646,245)Net investment-related losses$(1,318,490)$203,753 $(1,522,243)Net gains on derivative instrumentsThe increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and other investments. The underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio declined in value in the current period primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and wider credit spreads.The increase in the fair value of equity futures was driven primarily by the performance of equity markets. Global Atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in our variable annuity products which are accounted for in net policy benefits and claims. The majority of Global Atlantic's equity futures are based on the S&P 500 Index, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to an increase during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in, respectively, a gain and a loss on equity futures contracts in the respective periods.The decrease in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index call options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the increase during the year ended December 31, 2021.The decrease in the fair value of interest rate contracts was driven by an increase in market interest rates during both the year ended December 31, 2022 and the prior financial reporting period, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts.The decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest receivable was primarily due to widening of credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the tightening of credit spreads in the year ended December 31, 2021.146Table of ContentsNet other investment lossesThe components of net other investment losses were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies$87,198 $527,788 $(440,590)Realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities(559,987)(201,411)(358,576)Credit loss allowances(456,176)(249,338)(206,838)Unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities classified as trading(2,603,874)(118,714)(2,485,160)Unrealized gains on investments classified as trading or fair-value option60,237 39,758 20,479 Unrealized (losses) gains on real estate investments recognized at fair value under investment company accounting(42,870)35,418 (78,288)Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest, payable portfolio38,074 (30,015)68,089 Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest, receivable portfolio(3,176)12,418 (15,594)Other(184,663)(34,896)(149,767)Net investment-related gains$(3,665,237)$(18,992)$(3,646,245)The increase in net other investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to (i) an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities classified as trading was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and widening credit spreads in the current period, (ii) a decrease in realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies primarily due to the non-recurrence of a gain from the disposition of Origis USA, LLC (Infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector) in the prior financial reporting period, (iii) the increase in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities primarily due to portfolio rotation in a higher interest rate environment, (iv) an increase in credit loss allowances on mortgage and other loan receivables in the current period primarily due to an increase in credit risk of our loan portfolio, offset in part by the recognition of an initial credit loan loss allowance upon the adoption of the current expected credit loss accounting standard concurrent with the GA Acquisition in the prior financial reporting period, and (v) realized losses on renewable energy investments in the current period.Offsetting these losses were realized gains on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio.Other incomeOther income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior financial reporting period primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021.ExpensesNet policy benefits and claimsNet policy benefits and claims decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) lower initial reserves assumed related to fewer new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and (ii) a decrease in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of lower equity market returns (as discussed above under ""Revenues—Net gains on derivatives instruments,"" Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims). This decrease was offset by (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (iii) an increase in variable annuity reserves primarily due to lower equity market returns, (iv) higher funding costs on new business, and (v) unfavorable unlocking related to the assumption review described above under “—Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)—Insurance (Unaudited)—Assumption Review.”147Table of ContentsAmortization of policy acquisition costsAmortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a decrease in the net benefit (that is, a reduction to expense) from the amortization of the net negative insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the GA Acquisition, as the underlying business runs off, and (ii) growth in our individual market channel. Offsetting these increases in expense was (i) a decrease of amortization due to realized investment losses in the current period, and (ii) favorable unlocking related to the assumption review described above under “—Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)—Insurance (Unaudited)—Assumption Review.”Interest expenseInterest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a net increase in debt outstanding, including a draw on Global Atlantic's revolving credit facility in the quarter ended March 31, 2022, (ii) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (Global Atlantic's revolving facility and fixed-to-floating swaps on Global Atlantic's fixed rate debt) due to higher market rates, and (iii) the impact of one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021.Insurance expensesInsurance expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) increased commission expense related to increased sales in our individual market and increased reinsurance transactions, and (iii) increased reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services as a result of an increase in reinsurance transactions.General, administrative and otherGeneral, administrative and other expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (iii) increased professional service fees, and (iv) increased third-party administrator (""TPA"") policy servicing fees, all due to growth of the business.Other Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)Income Tax Expense (Benefit)For the year ended December 31, 2022, income tax was a benefit of $35.7 million compared to an income tax expense of $1,353.3 million in the prior period. The tax benefit in the current period was generated primarily from deferred tax benefits recorded in connection with pre-tax unrealized losses driven by net capital allocation-based losses and investment losses offset by income tax expense relating to Global Atlantic’s insurance operations. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 19 ""Income Taxes"" to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The amount of U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes we pay in future periods may be materially increased if adverse tax laws become enacted. See “—Business Environment— Economic and Market Conditions” in this report.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership, (ii) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds, and (iii) interests that co-investors and rollover investors hold in Global Atlantic. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) net losses from investment activities at our consolidated investment funds and (ii) a net loss attributable to exchangeable securities in the current period.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. The net loss attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to (i) net capital allocation-based losses and (ii) net losses from investment activities, partially offset by (i) a higher level of management fees and (ii) a reversal of previously recognized accrued carried interest compensation, as described above.148Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from (i) North America Fund XIII, Global Infrastructure Investors IV, and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, all of which entered their investment periods in 2021 and (ii) Asian Fund IV, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Asian Fund III, Americas Fund XII, and Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering their post-investment periods in the third quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021, respectively, with all three investment funds now earning fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate for Asian Fund III and Americas Fund XII.Management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""Fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees in our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. Fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under GAAP. However, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under GAAP, KKR's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to KKR would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. Transaction and monitoring fees earned from KKR portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. Furthermore, 151Table of Contentstransaction fees earned in our Capital Markets business line are not shared with fund investors. Accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)The increase in carried interest and general partner capital interest during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was due primarily to a higher level of net appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III and North America Fund XI. Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was positive due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry-earning investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund III and North America Fund XI. KKR generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to KKR for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to KKR to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. In each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments.Investment Income (Loss) - Asset ManagementNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2021The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million.Investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities.

For a discussion and analysis of the investment gains or losses relating to the investments in our unconsolidated funds, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""Realized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net realized gains related primarily to the sales of our investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were in FanDuel Inc., Mr. Cooper Group Inc., and Darktrace Limited. Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses from certain investments held in our consolidated credit funds and realized losses on certain hedging instruments.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net unrealized gains related primarily to mark-to-market gains from our investments held by KKR and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were PetVet Care Centers, LLC, Heartland Dental LLC, and OutSystems Holdings S.A. Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses, the most significant of which are (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and (ii) an unrealized loss on BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and Note 5 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities for the year ended December 31, 2020The net gains from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were comprised of net realized gains of $162.9 million and net unrealized gains of $3,479.9 million.152Table of ContentsRealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in The Hut Group Limited (LSE: THG), (ii) partial sales of our investment in Fiserv, Inc., and (iii) the sale of our investment in Ivalua SAS (technology sector). Partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) an $88.3 million impairment charge taken on one of our investments that is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, (ii) a realized loss on the partial sale of our investment in LCI Helicopters Limited (financial services sector) and (iii) the realization of losses on certain investments held through consolidated CLOs and alternative credit funds.Unrealized Gains and Losses from Investment ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains in our growth equity and core investments held by KKR and certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., FanDuel Inc., and PetVet Care Centers, LLC. Partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above, (ii) mark-to-market losses on our investment in Fiserv, Inc., which is held both in our funds and as a coinvestment by KKR, and (iii) mark-to-market losses on certain investments held through consolidated alternative credit and real estate funds.For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's realized investment income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and Note 5 ""Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities - Asset Management"" in our financial statements.Dividend IncomeDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the most significant dividends received included (i) $215.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds, (ii) $138.7 million from our investment in Viridor Limited, and (iii) $70.9 million from our investment in Arnott's Biscuits Limited. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the most significant dividends received included $152.4 million from our consolidated real estate funds, $62.5 million from our investment in Fiserv, Inc. part of which is held as a co-investment by KKR, and $48.9 million from our investment in Epicor Software Corporation (technology sector). Significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's dividend income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""Interest IncomeThe increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) a higher level of interest income from certain of our consolidated credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed, and (ii) the impact of closing additional CLOs that are consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest income from investments at KREF as a result of the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest income, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results.""Interest ExpenseThe increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) the impact of issuances of our senior notes, (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from the financing arrangements of consolidated investment funds and other vehicles, and (iii) the impact of closing additional CLOs that were consolidated subsequent to December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest expense on debt obligations at KREF as a result of the deconsolidation of KREF in the fourth quarter of 2021. For a discussion of other factors that affected KKR's interest expense, see ""—Analysis of Non-GAAP Performance Measures.""153Table of ContentsExpenses - Asset ManagementCompensation and Benefits Expenses The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of accrued carried interest compensation resulting from a higher level of carried interest from the appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio in the current period, (ii) a higher level of accrued discretionary compensation and benefits resulting from a higher level of fee revenue, realized performance income and realized investment income in the current period, and (iii) a higher level of equity-based compensation.General, Administrative and OtherThe increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of expenses at our consolidated CLOs, investment funds and other vehicles, (ii) a higher level of broken-deal expenses, (iii) a higher level of expenses reimbursable by our investment funds, and (iv) placement fees incurred related to capital raising activities.The level of broken-deal expenses can vary significantly period to period based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are the number of potential investments being pursued for our investment funds, the size and complexity of investments being pursued and the number of investment funds currently in their investment period. Also, in periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other may increase accordingly. Similarly, our General, Administrative and Other may increase as a result of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development.Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) - InsuranceFor the year-ended December 31, 2021, the results of Global Atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, February 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.Assumption reviewThe assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities or an increase in deferred expenses, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.The following table reflects the impact on net income by financial statement line item and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from Global Atlantic’s assumption review:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021($ in thousands)Impacts of assumption review, by statement of income line item:Policy fees$182 Policy benefits and claims20,904 Amortization of policy acquisition costs(2,119)Income tax impact(3,983)Total assumption review impact on net income$14,984 Assumption review impact on adjustments to derive insurance segment adjusted operating earnings(97)Noncontrolling interests' share of assumption review impact(5,734)Total assumption review impact on insurance segment adjusted operating earnings$9,153 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net favorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to favorable mortality experience.154Table of ContentsRevenuesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Net Premiums$2,226,078 Policy Fees1,147,913 Net Investment Income2,845,623 Net Investment-Related Gains203,753 Other Income120,213 Total Insurance Revenues$6,543,580 Net PremiumsNet premiums were primarily driven by initial premiums related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies assumed during the year ended December 31, 2021. These initial premiums were wholly offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within policy benefits and claims (as discussed below).Policy feesPolicy fees were primarily driven by cost of insurance, administrative, and rider fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.Net investment incomeNet investment income was primarily driven by insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as determined as of the GA Acquisition on February 1, 2021). Average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. In addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also positively impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity.Net investment-related gains (losses)The components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Equity index options$549,987 Funds withheld payable embedded derivatives49,491 Funds withheld receivable embedded derivatives31,740 Equity future contracts(263,637)Interest rate contracts(146,920)Foreign currency forwards2,484 Credit risk contracts(400)Net gains on derivative instruments222,745 Net other investment losses(18,992)Net investment-related gains$203,753 Net gains on derivative instrumentsThe increase in the fair value of equity index options were primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. Global Atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change for which is accounted for in policy benefits and claims). The majority of Global Atlantic's equity index call options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2021.155Table of ContentsThe decrease in the fair value of equity futures and interest rate contracts were driven primarily by the performance of equity markets and interest rates. Global Atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in our variable annuity products which are accounted for in policy benefits and claims. The majority of Global Atlantic's equity futures are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on equity futures contracts. Market interest rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts. The increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable and receivable were primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the respective funds withheld at interest payable and receivable portfolios.Net other investment lossesThe components of net other investment losses were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies$527,788 Realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities(201,411)Credit loss allowances(249,338)Unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities classified as trading(118,714)Unrealized gains (losses) on investments classified as trading or accounted under a fair-value option39,758 Unrealized gains (losses) on real estate investments recognized at fair value under investment company accounting35,418 Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio(30,015)Realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest receivable portfolio12,418 Other(34,896)Net other investment losses$(18,992)Net other investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to (i) the recognition of a credit loan loss allowances as a result of the application of the current expected credit loss accounting standard adopted concurrent with the GA Acquisition, (ii) losses on the sale of available-for-sale (""AFS"") securities as a result of portfolio rotation strategies, and (iii) net unrealized losses on trading fixed maturity securities underlying a portion of the funds withheld payable at interest portfolio due to an increase in market interest rates. These losses were almost wholly offset by realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies, including in particular a gain from the disposition of Origis USA, LLC.Other incomeOther income is mainly driven by expense allowances on ceded reinsurance, administration, management fees and distribution fees.ExpensesPolicy benefits and claimsPolicy benefits and claims were primarily driven by (i) initial reserves related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies during the year ended December 31, 2021, (ii) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of higher equity market returns (as discussed above under ""Revenues—Net gains on derivative instruments,"" Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in policy benefits and claims), and (iii) an increase in net flows in the institutional and individual channels, all offset by a decrease in variable annuity reserves primarily due to higher equity market returns and market interest rates.156Table of ContentsAmortization of policy acquisition costsAmortization of policy acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the amortization of insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the Global Atlantic acquisition. Amortization is negative (that is, a reduction to expense) as a result of the net negative value-of-business-acquired insurance intangible recognized as part of the aforementioned purchase accounting.Interest expenseInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a net increase in debt outstanding due to the issuance of new senior and subordinated notes which was partially offset by the pay-down of other debt, and the favorable impact to interest expense as a result of the lower average coupon due on new debt added at lower interest rates.Insurance expensesInsurance expenses were primarily driven by (i) commission expense related to sales, and (ii) reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services during the year ended December 31, 2021.General, administrative and otherGeneral, administrative and other expenses were driven primarily by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) TPA policy servicing fees, (iii) technology hardware and software related charges, and (iv) professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2021.Other Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)Income Tax Expense (Benefit)For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax expense was $1,353.3 million compared to $609.1 million in the prior period. The increase in the income tax expense was primarily due to (i) a higher level of fees, capital allocation-based income and investment income as described above earned from asset management operations and (ii) the inclusion of income taxes relating to Global Atlantic's insurance operations. Our effective tax rate under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 9.9%. For a discussion of factors that impacted KKR's tax provision, see Note 19 ""Income Taxes"" in our financial statements. The amount of U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes we pay in future periods may be materially increased if adverse tax laws become enacted. See also “—Business Environment—Economic and Market Conditions” in this report.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet Income (Loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) interests of KKR Holdings and other exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership, (ii) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and (iii) interests that co-investors and rollover investors hold in Global Atlantic. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to a higher level of net income generated during the year ended December 31, 2021, allocable to the holders of the noncontrolling interests.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. Net Income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to (i) a higher level of net gains from investment activities, capital allocation-based income, and fees earned from asset management operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 as described above and (ii) the acquisition of Global Atlantic, which was completed in February 2021. These increases were partially offset by accrued carried interest compensation and income tax expense, each as described above.157Table of ContentsCondensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (GAAP Basis)The following table provides our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition on a GAAP basis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)As ofAs ofDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021AssetsAsset ManagementCash and Cash Equivalents$6,705,325 $6,699,668 Investments92,375,463 88,775,514 Other Assets7,114,360 4,244,894 106,195,148 99,720,076 InsuranceCash and Cash Equivalents6,118,231 3,391,934 Investments124,199,176 123,763,675 Other Assets40,564,636 37,409,755 170,882,043 164,565,364 Total Assets$277,077,191$264,285,440Liabilities and EquityAsset ManagementDebt Obligations$40,598,613 $36,669,755 Other Liabilities6,937,832 8,359,619 47,536,445 45,029,374 InsuranceDebt Obligations2,128,166 1,908,006 Other Liabilities173,753,695 159,208,840 175,881,861 161,116,846 Total Liabilities$223,418,306 $206,146,220 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests152,065 82,491 Stockholders' EquityStockholders' Equity - Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock1,115,792 1,115,792 Stockholders' Equity - Common Stock16,613,028 16,466,372 Noncontrolling Interests35,778,000 40,474,565 Total Equity53,506,820 58,056,729 Total Liabilities and Equity$277,077,191 $264,285,440 KKR & Co.

Inc. common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022.158Table of ContentsConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows (GAAP Basis) The following is a discussion of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities, which include certain consolidated investment funds, CLOs and certain variable interest entities formed by Global Atlantic notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those investment funds and CFEs. The assets of our consolidated investment funds and CFEs, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and CFEs involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating ActivitiesOur net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $(5.3) billion and $(7.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) investments purchased (asset management), net of proceeds from investments (asset management) of $(10.4) billion and $(10.6) billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (ii) net realized gains (losses) on asset management investments of $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments (asset management) of $(3.0) billion and $5.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (iv) capital allocation-based income (loss) of $(2.5) billion and $6.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and (v) net realized gains (losses) on insurance operations of $(1.0) billion and $(0.9) billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investment funds are investment companies under GAAP and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.Net Cash Provided (Used) by Investing ActivitiesOur net cash provided (used) by investing activities was $(13.6) billion and $(9.6) billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our investing activities included: (i) investments purchased (insurance), net of proceeds from investments (insurance), of $(11.8) billion and $(9.1) billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (ii) acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $(1.7) billion and $(473.8) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and (iii) the purchase of fixed assets of $(85.1) million and $(102.0) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Net Cash Provided (Used) by Financing ActivitiesOur net cash provided (used) by financing activities was $22.1 billion and $20.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) contributions by, net of distributions to, our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests of $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (ii) proceeds received, net of repayment of debt obligations, of $6.5 billion and $8.9 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (iii) additions to, net of withdrawals from, contractholder deposit funds of $9.3 billion and $5.9 billion during years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (iv) common stock dividends of $(444.3) million and $(331.4) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (v) net delivery of common stock of $(65.7) million and $(166.8) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (vi) repurchases of common stock of $(346.7) million and $(269.7) million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (vii) Series A and B Preferred Stock dividends of $(19.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2021, (viii) Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends of $(69.0) million during each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and (ix) private placement share issuance of $38.5 million during year ended December 31, 2021.159Table of ContentsAnalysis of Segment Operating ResultsThe following is a discussion of the results of our business on a segment basis for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under ""—Key Segment and Non-GAAP Performance Measures"" and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. See ""—Business Environment"" for more information about factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.For the year ended December 31, 2021, the results of our insurance segment are from February 1, 2021 (closing date of the GA Acquisition) through December 31, 2021.Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating ResultsThe following tables set forth information regarding KKR's asset management segment operating results and certain key capital metrics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Management Fees$2,656,487 $2,071,440 $585,047 Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net775,933 1,004,241 (228,308)Fee Related Performance Revenues90,665 45,852 44,813 Fee Related Compensation(769,735)(702,387)(67,348)Other Operating Expenses(585,999)(449,155)(136,844)Fee Related Earnings2,167,351 1,969,991 197,360 Realized Performance Income2,176,658 2,141,596 35,062 Realized Performance Income Compensation(1,333,526)(1,239,177)(94,349)Realized Investment Income1,134,419 1,613,244 (478,825)Realized Investment Income Compensation(159,003)(241,994)82,991 Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$3,985,899 $4,243,660 $(257,761)Management FeesThe following table presents management fees by business line:Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Management FeesPrivate Equity$1,188,463 $967,038 $221,425 Real Assets679,890 437,102 242,788 Credit and Liquid Strategies788,134 667,300 120,834 Total Management Fees$2,656,487 $2,071,440 $585,047 The increase in Private Equity business line management fees was primarily attributable to a higher level of management fees earned from North America Fund XIII and European Fund VI. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from European Fund V and Americas Fund XII as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate. During the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately $11 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period.160Table of ContentsThe increase in Real Assets business line management fees was primarily due to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors IV, (ii) an increase in management fees earned from Global Atlantic and (iii) management fees earned on assets managed by KJRM, which we acquired in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from (i) Real Estate Partners Americas II as a result of a decline in capital invested from investment realizations (of which this investment fund's fee base is invested capital) and (ii) Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering its post-investment period and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed.The increase in Credit and Liquid Strategies business line management fees was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in management fees earned from Global Atlantic and (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from FS KKR Capital Corp. (""FSK""), our business development company.Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line:Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetPrivate Equity$120,410 $122,478 $(2,068)Real Assets33,202 20,687 12,515 Credit and Liquid Strategies22,018 14,181 7,837 Capital Markets600,303 846,895 (246,592)Total Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net$775,933 $1,004,241 $(228,308)Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. The decrease in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Overall, we completed 240 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which 29 represented equity offerings and 211 represented debt offerings, as compared to 358 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets and credit funds as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 14% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 46% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 38% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.Our Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are generally required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. Additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. The decrease in our Private Equity business line transaction and monitoring fees, net, was primarily attributable to a lower average transaction fee earned in 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 77 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.3 million compared to 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 46% of Private Equity transaction fees were paid by companies in North America, 31% were paid from companies in the Asia-Pacific region, and 23% were paid from companies in Europe. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the amount of the fees as set forth in the transaction agreements, the complexity of the transaction, and KKR's role in the transaction.161Table of ContentsFee Related Performance RevenuesThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by business line:Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Fee Related Performance RevenuesPrivate Equity$— $— $— Real Assets51,183 9,068 42,115 Credit and Liquid Strategies39,482 36,784 2,698 Total Fee Related Performance Revenues$90,665 $45,852 $44,813 Fee related performance revenues represent performance fees that are (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.

Fee related performance revenues were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period primarily due to performance revenues earned from KPPA and KJRM in the current period.Fee Related CompensationThe increase in fee related compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings.Other Operating ExpensesThe increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm and (ii) an increase in travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.Fee Related EarningsThe increase in fee related earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of management fees from our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines and a higher level of fee related performance revenues, partially offset by a lower level of transaction and monitoring fees, net, and a higher level of fee related compensation and other operating expenses, as described above.Realized Performance IncomeThe following table presents realized performance income by business line:Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Realized Performance IncomePrivate Equity$1,903,580 $1,678,753 $224,827 Real Assets113,465 97,312 16,153 Credit and Liquid Strategies159,613 365,531 (205,918)Total Realized Performance Income$2,176,658 $2,141,596 $35,062 162Table of ContentsYears EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Private EquityNorth America Fund XI$932,428 $433,708 $498,720 Core Investment Vehicles262,219 80,937 181,282 2006 Fund231,689 219,737 11,952 Americas Fund XII197,023 207,559 (10,536)Asian Fund III104,601 387,863 (283,262)European Fund IV86,233 186,476 (100,243)Co-Investment Vehicles and Other55,868 90,305 (34,437)Next Generation Technology Growth Fund— 32,544 (32,544)European Fund III— 353 (353)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)1,870,061 1,639,482 230,579 Incentive Fees33,519 39,271 (5,752)Total Realized Performance Income$1,903,580 $1,678,753 $224,827 Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Real AssetsReal Estate Partners Americas II$95,772 $— $95,772 Global Infrastructure Investors II17,693 72,862 (55,169)Real Estate Partners Europe— 18,200 (18,200)Co-Investment Vehicles and Other— 3,283 (3,283)Global Infrastructure Investors— 2,967 (2,967)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)113,465 97,312 16,153 Incentive Fees— — — Total Realized Performance Income$113,465 $97,312 $16,153 Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Credit and Liquid StrategiesAlternative Credit and Other Funds$10,334 $15,336 $(5,002)Total Realized Carried Interest (1)10,334 15,336 (5,002)Incentive Fees149,279 350,195 (200,916)Total Realized Performance Income$159,613 $365,531 $(205,918)(1)The above tables exclude any funds for which there was no realized carried interest during both of the periods presented.Realized performance income includes (i) realized carried interest from our carry-earning funds and (ii) incentive fees not included in Fee Related Performance Revenues.Realized carried interest in our Private Equity business line for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of realized proceeds from the sales of our investments in Internet Brands, Inc.

Partially offsetting these decreases was new capital raised from European Fund VI, a new strategic investor partnership investing across multi-strategies, and Next Generation Technology Growth Fund III.For the year ended December 31, 2022, the value of our traditional private equity investment portfolio decreased by 14%. This was comprised of a 57% decrease in share prices of various publicly held investments and a 1% decrease in value of our privately held investments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the value of our growth equity investment portfolio decreased 11% and our core private equity investment portfolio increased 7%. The most significant decreases in share prices of our publicly held investments were decreases in AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP), Max Healthcare Institute Limited (NSE: MAXHEALTH), and GoTo Gojek Tokopedia PT Tbk (IDX: GOTO). These decreases were partially offset by increases in share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Hensoldt AG (FRA: HAG) and KnowBe4, Inc. (NASDAQ: KNBE). The prices of publicly held companies may experience volatile changes following the reporting period. See ""—Business Environment"" for more information about the factors, such as volatility, that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.The most significant decreases in the value of our privately held investments were decreases in Kokusai Electric Corporation, OneStream Software, LLC (technology sector), and Unzer GmbH (financial services sector). These decreases in value on our privately held investments were partially offset by increases in the value of certain other privately held investments, the most significant of which were CHI Overhead Doors, Inc., ERM Worldwide Group Limited, and Internet Brands, Inc. The decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables, both influenced by the economic outlook and overall market environment. The increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance, (ii) with respect to CHI Overhead Doors, Inc., an increase in valuation reflecting an agreement to exit the investment, which was executed in the period, and (iii) with respect to Internet Brands, Inc. an increase in valuation driven by a partial sale transaction, which was executed in the period.

Partially offsetting these increases were payments to Global Atlantic policyholders and distributions to fund investors as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from Global Infrastructure Investors III and Real Estate Partners Americas II. The decrease in investment value was due to the impact of the (i) decline in the value of the Japanese yen associated with assets managed by KJRM and the decline in value of our real estate credit portfolio partially offset by the increase in value across our energy, infrastructure and opportunistic real estate equity investment portfolios.For the year ended December 31, 2022, the value of our energy investment portfolio increased by 18%, the value of our infrastructure investment portfolio increased 5%, and the value of our opportunistic real estate equity investment portfolio increased by 3%. The most significant increases in the value of our privately held investments related to various assets held in our energy portfolio, Sempra Global, L.P. (Infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector), and Viridor Limited. These increases in value were partially offset by decreases in value relating primarily to Colonial Enterprises, Inc. (midstream sector) and various assets held in our opportunistic real estate equity investment portfolio. The increased valuations of individual companies or assets in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company or asset performance.

The decrease was offset in part by (i) higher net investment income resulting from an increase in average assets under management due to growth of the business, and higher average yields, (ii) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, and (iii) a decrease in income tax expense. 171Table of ContentsNet investment incomeNet investment income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) growth in portfolio yields due to higher market interest rates on floating rate investments, (iii) rotation into higher yielding assets, and (iv) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets in our institutional market channel as a result of new reinsurance transactions and individual market channel sales from new business growth. Offsetting these increases to net investment income was a decrease in variable investment income, primarily due to the non-recurrence of net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies, including in particular the disposition of Origis USA, LLC, reported in the prior financial reporting period.Net cost of insuranceNet cost of insurance increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) growth in reserves in the institutional market as a result of new reinsurance transactions and in the individual market as a result of new business volumes, and (iii) higher funding costs on new business originated, and (iv) the impact of assumption review (as described in “—Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis)—Insurance (Unaudited)—Assumption Review” above).General, administrative and other expensesGeneral and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the GA Acquisition having occurred on February 1, 2021, (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits-related expenses, (iii) increased professional service fees, and (iv) increased TPA policy servicing fees, all due to growth of the business.Income taxesInsurance segment income tax expense reflects the effective tax rate for the insurance segment on an operating basis, including the benefit of investment tax credits for the prior year period.Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 in proportion to the decrease in insurance segment operating earnings for the comparable period. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the proportionate interest in the insurance segment operating earnings attributable to other investors in Global Atlantic.172Table of ContentsAnalysis of Non-GAAP Performance MeasuresThe following is a discussion of our Non-GAAP performance measures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:Year EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Change($ in thousands)Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$3,985,899 $4,243,660 $(257,761)Insurance Segment Operating Earnings545,204 652,551 (107,347)Distributable Operating Earnings4,531,103 4,896,211 (365,108)Interest Expense(315,189)(250,183)(65,006)Preferred Dividends— (19,201)19,201 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(23,200)(23,664)464 Income Taxes Paid(738,841)(687,572)(51,269)After-tax Distributable Earnings$3,453,873 $3,915,591 $(461,718)For the year ended December 31, 2021, the results of our insurance segment above are from February 1, 2021 (closing date of the GA Acquisition) through December 31, 2021.Distributable Operating Earnings The decrease in distributable operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a lower level of asset management segment operating earnings and insurance segment operating earnings. For a discussion of the asset management and insurance segment operating earnings, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results"" and ""—Analysis of Insurance Segment Operating Results.""Interest ExpenseThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is due primarily to debt issuances by KKR's financing subsidiaries. Preferred Dividends The decrease in preferred dividends for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was attributable to the redemption of all of our Series A and B preferred stock.Income Taxes PaidThe increase in income taxes paid for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower tax benefit from equity-based compensation and an increase in U.S. state and local taxes.After-tax Distributable EarningsThe decrease in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a lower level of distributable operating earnings and an increase in interest expense and income taxes paid, partially offset by a decrease in preferred dividends, as discussed above.For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation included in income taxes paid was $65.4 million and $123.1 million, respectively. The inclusion of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation in After-tax Distributable Earnings had the effect of increasing this measure by 2% and 3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.173Table of ContentsAnalysis of Asset Management Segment Operating ResultsThe following tables set forth information regarding KKR's asset management segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Management Fees$2,071,440 $1,441,578 $629,862 Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net1,004,241 632,433 371,808 Fee Related Performance Revenues45,852 39,555 6,297 Fee Related Compensation(702,387)(486,481)(215,906)Other Operating Expenses(449,155)(346,558)(102,597)Fee Related Earnings1,969,991 1,280,527 689,464 Realized Performance Income2,141,596 1,165,699 975,897 Realized Performance Income Compensation(1,239,177)(697,071)(542,106)Realized Investment Income1,613,244 644,659 968,585 Realized Investment Income Compensation(241,994)(106,830)(135,164)Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$4,243,660 $2,286,984 $1,956,676 Management FeesThe following table presents management fees by business line:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Management FeesPrivate Equity$967,038 $714,070 $252,968 Real Assets437,102 262,537 174,565 Credit and Liquid Strategies667,300 464,971 202,329 Total Management Fees$2,071,440 $1,441,578 $629,862 The increase in Private Equity business line management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from North America Fund XIII, Asian Fund IV, and Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Americas Fund XII and Asian Fund III as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate.The increase in Real Assets business line management fees was primarily due to (i) management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors IV and Real Estate Partners Americas III, and (ii) an increase in management fees earned from Global Atlantic. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering its post-investment period and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed.The increase in Credit and Liquid Strategies business line management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees earned from Global Atlantic during the period February 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, (ii) the issuance of new CLOs subsequent to December 31, 2020, (iii) higher overall FPAUM at our hedge fund partnerships from investment appreciation and, to a lesser extent, net capital inflows, and (iv) net capital inflows in certain leveraged credit strategy accounts.174Table of ContentsTransaction and Monitoring Fees, NetThe following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Transaction and Monitoring Fees, NetPrivate Equity$122,478 $135,235 $(12,757)Real Assets20,687 13,172 7,515 Credit and Liquid Strategies14,181 3,543 10,638 Capital Markets846,895 480,483 366,412 Total Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net$1,004,241 $632,433 $371,808 Our Capital Markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. The increase in transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, we completed 358 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings, as compared to 193 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which 36 represented equity offerings and 157 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines as well as from third-party companies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 23% of our transaction fees in our Capital Markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 18% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of our transaction fees were generated outside of North America as compared to approximately 58% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Capital Markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. Our Capital Markets business line does not generate monitoring fees.Our Private Equity, Real Assets, and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. Additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments.The decrease in Private Equity business line transaction and monitoring fees, net was primarily attributable to the write-off of outstanding monitoring fee receivables for two portfolio companies, partially offset by an increase in net transaction fees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there were 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.5 million compared to 54 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 52% of these transaction fees were paid by companies in North America, 25% were paid from companies in Europe, and 23% of these transaction fees were paid from companies in the Asia-Pacific region. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, amount of the fees as set forth in the governing agreements, the complexity of the transaction, and KKR's role in the transaction.175Table of ContentsFee Related Performance RevenuesThe following table presents fee related performance revenues by business line:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Fee Related Performance RevenuesPrivate Equity$— $— $— Real Assets9,068 4,797 4,271 Credit and Liquid Strategies36,784 34,758 2,026 Total Fee Related Performance Revenues$45,852 $39,555 $6,297 Fee related performance revenues represent performance fees that are (i) to be received from our investment funds, vehicles, and accounts on a recurring basis and (ii) not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account.

Partially offsetting these increases were (i) payments made to Global Atlantic to satisfy its obligations to policyholders, (ii) redemptions at our hedge fund partnerships and leveraged credit separately managed accounts and (iii) distributions to fund investors as a result of realized proceeds at certain leveraged and alternative credit funds.See also ""—Business Environment"" for more information about the factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.181Table of ContentsFee Paying Assets Under ManagementPrivate EquityThe following table reflects the changes in the FPAUM of our Private Equity business line from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021: ($ in millions)December 31, 2020$68,506 New Capital Raised29,649 Distributions and Other(7,428)Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (2,569)Change in Value(268)December 31, 2021$87,890 FPAUM of our Private Equity business line was $87.9 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $19.4 billion, compared to $68.5 billion at December 31, 2020.The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised from North America Fund XIII, Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II, and our core investment strategy. Partially offsetting this increase were (i) distributions to fund investors, primarily as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from 2006 Fund, North America Fund XI, and Americas Fund XII and (ii) a change in fee base for Americas Fund XII and Health Care Growth Fund as a result of these funds entering its post-investment period, during which we earn fees on invested capital rather than committed capital. Uncalled capital commitments from private equity and multi-strategy investment funds from which KKR is currently not earning management fees amounted to approximately $19.6 billion at December 31, 2021, which includes capital commitments reserved for follow-on investments for funds that have completed their investment periods. This capital will generally begin to earn management fees upon deployment of the capital or upon the commencement of the fund's investment period. The average annual management fee rate associated with this capital is approximately 1.0%. The date on which we begin to earn fees (as specified above) is not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for an extended period of time. If and when such management fees are earned, a portion of existing FPAUM may cease paying fees or pay lower fees, thus offsetting a portion of any new management fees earned.Real AssetsThe following table reflects the changes in the FPAUM of our Real Assets business line from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021: ($ in millions)December 31, 2020$25,690 New Capital Raised35,615 Acquisitions and Other(1)12,012 Distributions and Other(4,264)Net Changes in Fee Base of Certain Funds (2,829)Change in Value741 December 31, 2021$66,965 (1)Reflects the FPAUM of Global Atlantic at February 1, 2021.FPAUM of our Real Assets business line was $67.0 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $41.3 billion, compared to $25.7 billion at December 31, 2020.The increase was primarily attributable to (i) new capital raised by Global Infrastructure Investors IV, Global Atlantic, Real Estate Partners Americas III and Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund and (ii) assets we now manage under our investment agreements with Global Atlantic's insurance companies. Partially offsetting these increases were (i) payments to Global Atlantic policyholders and distributions to fund investors as a result of realized proceeds, most notably from Global Infrastructure Investors II and Real Estate Partners Americas II and (ii) a change in fee base for Global Infrastructure Investors III as a result of entering its post-investment period, during which we earn fees on invested capital rather than committed capital.182Table of ContentsUncalled capital commitments from real assets investment funds from which KKR is currently not earning management fees amounted to approximately $11.7 billion at December 31, 2021, which includes capital commitments reserved for follow-on investments for funds that have completed their investment periods.

The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which were partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period. 183Table of ContentsReal AssetsAs of December 31, 2021, our Real Assets business line had $35.2 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $17.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which were partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.Credit and Liquid StrategiesAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $10.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. Uncalled commitments remained flat against the comparable period as new capital commitments from fund investors were offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.Capital InvestedPrivate EquityFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $17.6 billion of capital was invested by our Private Equity business line, as compared to $14.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven primarily by a $1.5 billion increase in capital invested in our core investment strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 60% of capital deployed in private equity was in transactions in North America, 21% was in Europe, and 19% was in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.Real AssetsFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $21.4 billion of capital was invested by our Real Assets business line, as compared to $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven primarily by a $9.6 billion increase in capital invested in our real estate strategy and a $6.8 billion increase in capital invested in our infrastructure strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 71% of capital deployed in real assets was in transactions in North America, 23% was in Europe, and 6% was in the Asia-Pacific region. The number of large Real Asset investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.Credit and Liquid StrategiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $34.4 billion of capital was invested by our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, as compared to $10.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to (i) capital deployed under our investment management agreements with Global Atlantic's insurance companies and (ii) a higher level of capital deployed across our direct lending and SIG strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 90% of capital deployed was in transactions in North America, 9% was in Europe and 1% was in the Asia-Pacific region.184Table of ContentsAnalysis of Insurance Segment Operating ResultsAs discussed above, our Insurance segment consists solely of the operations of Global Atlantic, which was acquired on February 1, 2021. Accordingly, prior financial reporting periods have been excluded for Insurance segment results. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the results of our Insurance segment is from the acquisition date, February 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.The following tables set forth information regarding KKR's insurance segment operating results and certain key operating metrics as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021($ in thousands)Net Investment Income$3,329,570 Net Cost of Insurance(1,566,681)General, Administrative and Other(500,410)Pre-tax Insurance Operating Earnings1,262,479 Income Taxes(199,095)Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(410,833)Insurance Segment Operating Earnings$652,551 Insurance segment operating earningsInsurance segment operating earnings were primarily driven by net investment income and stable net cost of insurance.Net investment incomeNet investment income was primarily driven by (i) insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as of the closing date of the GA Acquisition), and (ii) variable investment income from net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies, including in particular the disposition of Origis USA, LLC. Average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. In addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity.Net cost of insuranceNet cost of insurance was driven primarily by stable liability performance across in-force and new business, including favorable adjustments to reserves and policy acquisition costs resulting from higher reserves and insurance intangibles established as part of the purchase accounting for the GA Acquisition and the impact of assumption review (as described in “—Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis) – Insurance (Unaudited)” above).General, administrative and other expensesGeneral and administrative expenses were driven by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) policy servicing fees, (iii) technology-related charges and (iv) consulting and professional fees.Income taxesInsurance segment income tax expense reflects the effective tax rate for the insurance segment on an operating basis, including the benefit of investment tax credits.Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interestsIncome attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of the insurance segment adjusted operating earnings attributable to rollover and co-investors in Global Atlantic.185Table of ContentsAnalysis of Non-GAAP Performance MeasuresThe following is a discussion of our Non-GAAP performance measures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Change($ in thousands)Asset Management Segment Operating Earnings$4,243,660 $2,286,984 $1,956,676 Insurance Segment Operating Earnings652,551 — 652,551 Distributable Operating Earnings4,896,211 2,286,984 2,609,227 Interest Expense(250,183)(211,037)(39,146)Preferred Dividends(19,201)(33,364)14,163 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests(23,664)(7,842)(15,822)Income Taxes Paid(687,572)(265,950)(421,622)After-tax Distributable Earnings$3,915,591 $1,768,791 $2,146,800 As discussed in the Analysis of Segment Operating Results, following the acquisition of Global Atlantic, we re-evaluated our operating structure and the manner by which we manage and assess the performance of our businesses and allocate our resources. In the first quarter of 2021, we changed the presentation of our non-GAAP performance measures principally to reflect how we evaluate our business following the Global Atlantic acquisition. We also believe that this revised presentation improves the comparability of our non-GAAP financial information with that provided by other publicly traded companies in the alternative asset management industry.Distributable Operating Earnings The increase in distributable operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of Asset Management segment operating earnings and the addition of our Insurance segment operating earnings in connection with the Global Atlantic acquisition. For a discussion of the Asset Management and Insurance segment operating earnings, see ""—Analysis of Asset Management Segment Operating Results and Analysis of Insurance Segment Operating Results.""Interest ExpenseFor the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest expense relates primarily to the interest expense from our senior notes outstanding for KKR and KFN.The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to new note issuances.Preferred DividendsThe decrease in preferred dividends for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was attributable to the redemption of all of our Series A and B preferred stock outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021.Income Taxes PaidThe increase in income taxes paid for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings.After-tax Distributable Earnings The increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid and interest expense, as discussed above.186Table of ContentsFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation included in income taxes paid was $123.1 million and $59.1 million, respectively. The inclusion of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation in After-tax Distributable Earnings had the effect of increasing this measure by 3% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.Non-GAAP Balance Sheet MeasuresBook ValueThe following table presents our calculation of book value as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:As of December 31, 2022December 31, 2021 ($ in thousands)(+)Cash and Short-term Investments$3,256,515 $4,869,203 (+)Investments17,628,327 17,763,542 (+)Net Unrealized Carried Interest (1)2,509,589 4,967,401 (+)Other Assets, Net (2)6,979,235 4,706,108 (+)Global Atlantic Book Value 3,929,710 3,372,498 (-)Debt Obligations - KKR (excluding KFN and Global Atlantic)6,957,932 5,836,267 (-)Debt Obligations - KFN948,517 948,517 (-)Tax Liabilities, Net1,648,600 2,697,317 (-)Other Liabilities911,612 774,711 (-)Noncontrolling Interests32,843 33,058 Book Value$23,803,872 $25,388,882 Book Value Per Adjusted Share$26.73 $28.77 Adjusted Shares890,628,190 882,589,036 (1)The following table provides net unrealized carried interest by business line:As ofDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021($ in thousands)Private Equity Business Line$2,199,869 $4,697,134 Real Assets Business Line212,974 159,709 Credit and Liquid Strategies Business Line96,746 110,558 Total$2,509,589 $4,967,401 (2)Other Assets, Net include our (i) ownership interest in FS/KKR Advisor, (ii) minority ownership interests in hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) the net assets of KJRM.Book value decreased 6% from December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a reduction in net unrealized carried interest due to the reversal of previously recognized carried interest from our carried interest eligible investment funds, most notably Americas Fund XII, Asian Fund II, and Asian Fund III, (ii) a reduction in the value of our asset management segment investments of 5%, (iii) repurchases of our common stock, and (iv) payment of dividends during the period. Partially offsetting these decreases was the positive impact of our after-tax distributable earnings recognized and a decrease in the amount of deferred tax liabilities during the period.

As of December 31, 2021, 97% and 87% of Global Atlantic's AFS fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from NAIC and NRSROs, respectively. Securities where a rating by an NRSRO was not available are considered investment grade if they have an NAIC designation of “1” or “2.” The three largest asset categories in Global Atlantic's AFS fixed-maturity security portfolio as of December 31, 2022 were Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, comprising 29%, 5% and 5% of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. Within these categories, 94%, 95% and 95% of Global Atlantic's Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NAIC ratings and 94%, 45% and 53% of its Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NRSRO ratings as of December 31, 2022. The three largest asset categories in Global Atlantic's AFS fixed-maturity security portfolio as of December 31, 2021 were Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, comprising 34%, 6% and 5% of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. Within these categories, 95%, 96% and 99% of Global Atlantic's Corporate, RMBS and CMBS 189Table of Contentssecurities, respectively, were investment grade according to NAIC ratings and 95%, 38% and 62% of its Corporate, RMBS and CMBS securities, respectively, were investment grade according to NRSRO ratings as of December 31, 2021. NRSRO and NAIC ratings have different methodologies. Global Atlantic believes the NAIC ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its AFS fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. The portion of Global Atlantic's investment portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 29% and 20% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Within the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 97% and 96% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by NAIC designation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Trading fixed maturity securities back funds withheld payable at interest where the investment performance is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements.Credit quality of AFS fixed maturity securitiesThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the AFS fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called “NAIC designations.” Using an internally developed rating is permitted by the NAIC if no rating is available. These designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of NRSROs for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. NAIC designations of “1,” highest quality, and “2,” high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by NRSROs. NAIC designations “3” through “6” include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by NRSROs.Consistent with the NAIC Process and Procedures Manual, an NRSRO rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (i) the equivalent S&P rating where the security is rated by one NRSRO; (ii) the equivalent S&P rating of the lowest NRSRO when the security is rated by two NRSROs; and (iii) the equivalent S&P rating of the second lowest NRSRO if the security is rated by three or more NRSROs. If the lowest two NRSROs’ ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. NRSROs’ ratings available for the periods presented were S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.Substantially all of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, 95% and 97% as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were invested in investment grade assets with a NAIC rating of 1 or 2.The portion of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by NAIC designation was 5% and 3% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pursuant to Global Atlantic's investment guidelines, Global Atlantic actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated NAIC 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from Global Atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated NAIC 3 or lower.Corporate fixed maturity securitiesGlobal Atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 59% and 60%, respectively, of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately, 5% and 3%, respectively, of the portfolio is denominated in foreign currency. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 94% and 95% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated NAIC investment grade and 94% and 95% is rated NRSROs investment grade, respectively.Residential mortgage-backed securitiesAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 10% and 11% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in RMBS, respectively. RMBS are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, Global Atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.190Table of ContentsThe NAIC designations for RMBS, including prime, sub-prime, alt-A, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options (""Option ARM""), are based upon a comparison of the bond’s amortized cost to the NAIC’s loss expectation for each security. Accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality NAIC designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. Prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 90% and 93%, respectively, of RMBS securities that are below investment grade as rated by the NRSRO, carry an NAIC 1 (""highest quality"") designation.As of December 31, 2022, Alt-A, Option ARM, Re-Performing and Sub-prime represent 31%, 28%, 14% and 12% of the total RMBS portfolio ($6.4 billion), respectively. As of December 31, 2021, Alt-A, Option ARM, Re-Performing and Sub-prime represent 33%, 30%, 14% and 12% of the total RMBS portfolio ($7.7 billion), respectively.Unrealized gains and losses for AFS fixed maturity securitiesGlobal Atlantic's investments in AFS fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes and offsets. Unrealized gains and losses can be created by changes in interest rates or by changes in credit spreads.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Global Atlantic had gross unrealized losses on below investment grade AFS fixed maturity securities of $917.6 million and $80.3 million based on NRSRO rating and $224.9 million and $13.5 million based on NAIC ratings, respectively. Unrealized losses were not recognized in net income on these debt securities because there were no specific securities that, as of each such date, Global Atlantic intended to sell or believed it was more likely than not that it would be required to sell before recovery of their cost or amortized cost basis.Mortgage and other loan receivables - Credit quality indicatorsMortgage and other loan receivables consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans, and other loan receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 28% and 23%, respectively, of Global Atlantic's total investments consisted of mortgage and other loan receivables. Global Atlantic invests in U.S. mortgage loans, comprised of first lien and mezzanine real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and other loan receivables. Global Atlantic's commercial mortgage loans may also be rated based on NAIC designations, with designations “CM1” and “CM2” considered to be investment grade. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 88% and 96% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio was rated investment grade based on NAIC designation, respectively. 100% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in current status. As of December 31, 2022, 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is in current status, and approximately $192.3 million is over 90 days past due (representing 2% of the total residential mortgage portfolio).The loan-to-value ratio is expressed as a percentage of the current amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying collateral. Approximately 84% of the commercial mortgage loans has a loan-to-value ratio of 70% or less and 3% has loan-to-value ratio over 90%.Changing economic conditions affect Global Atlantic’s valuation of commercial mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that Global Atlantic performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or increase or decrease in) a commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance for losses. In addition, Global Atlantic continuously monitors its commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events or have deteriorating credit.The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for residential mortgage loans was 64% and 68% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Global Atlantic's residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised mainly of re-performing loans that were purchased at a discount after they were modified and returned to performing status, as well as prime jumbo loans and mortgage loans backed by single family rental properties. Global Atlantic has also extended financing to counterparties in the form of repurchase agreements secured by mortgage loans, including performing and non-performing mortgage loans. 191Table of ContentsGlobal Atlantic’s consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of home improvement loans, solar panel loans, student loans and auto loans.Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresThe following tables reconcile the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to KKR's non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2020 ($ in thousands)Total GAAP Revenues$5,721,195 $16,236,148 $4,230,891 Impact of Consolidation and Other841,711 808,174 461,244 Asset Management Adjustments:Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) (GAAP)2,500,509 (6,842,414)(2,224,100)Realized Carried Interest1,993,860 1,752,130 1,042,204 Realized Investment Income1,134,419 1,613,244 644,659 Capstone Fees(86,665)(91,407)(81,452)Expense Reimbursements(102,927)(178,572)(149,522)Insurance Adjustments:Net Premiums(1,182,461)(2,226,078)— Policy Fees(1,278,736)(1,147,913)— Other Income(139,124)(120,213)— Investment Gains and Losses472,053 544,357 — Derivative Gains and Losses1,072,572 (141,513)— Total Segment Revenues (1)$10,946,406 $10,205,943 $3,923,924 (1)Total Segment Revenues is comprised of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, (v) Realized Investment Income, and (vi) Net Investment Income.192Table of ContentsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co.

The overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. Our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and CLOs; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and holders of our preferred stock; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. See ""—Liquidity—Liquidity Needs—Dividends."" See ""—Business Environment"" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.194Table of ContentsSources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in CLOs; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions and funding agreements, including through memberships in Federal Home Loan Banks; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including CLOs and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, repurchase agreements, and other borrowing arrangements. In addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our or our subsidiaries' equity securities.Many of our investment funds like our private equity and real assets funds provide for carried interest. With respect to our carry-paying investment funds, carried interest is eligible to be distributed to the general partner of the fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. Even after all of the preceding conditions are met, the general partner of the fund may, in its sole discretion, decide to defer the distribution of carried interest to it to a later date. In addition, these funds generally include what is called a “clawback” provision, which provides that the general partner must return any carried interest that is paid in excess of what the general partner is entitled to receive at the end of the term of the fund, as discussed further below.As of December 31, 2022, certain of our investment funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a ""netting hole."" When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. Strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. As of December 31, 2022, there was no netting hole in excess of $50 million at any of our investment funds that had a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest. In accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. There are also investment funds that are not accruing carried interest and do not have a netting hole although they may be in a clawback position. If the investment fund has distributed carried interest, but subsequently does not have sufficient value to provide for the distribution of carried interest at the end of the life of the investment fund, the general partner is typically required to return previously distributed carried interest to the fund investors. Although our current and former employees who received distributions of carried interest subject to clawback are required to return them to KKR, it is KKR’s obligation to return carried interest subject to clawback to the fund investors. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $520 million of carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry-paying funds and their alternative investment vehicles were liquidated at their December 31, 2022 fair values. As of December 31, 2022, Asia Fund II is the only investment fund with a clawback obligation in excess of $50 million. See Note 25 ""Commitments and Contingencies—Contingent Repayment Guarantees"" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information.We have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. 195Table of ContentsFor a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see Note 17 ""Debt Obligations"" in our financial statements.Liquidity NeedsWe expect that our (including Global Atlantic's) primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to meet various obligations, including, without limitation, to:•continue to support and grow our Asset Management business lines, including seeding new investment strategies, supporting capital commitments made by our vehicles to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting the investment vehicles that we sponsor;•continue to support and grow our insurance business;•grow and expand our businesses generally, including by acquiring or launching new, complementary or adjacent businesses;•warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or CLOs or other investment vehicles pending the contribution of committed capital by the fund investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;•service debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities, including from litigation, that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions;•fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters and guarantees;•pay corporate income taxes and other taxes;•pay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance or funding agreement activity;•pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement;•pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock, if any;•underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business;•post or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts;•acquire other assets for our Principal Activities business line, including other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for CLOs (to the extent they may apply); •address capital needs of regulated subsidiaries as well as non-regulated subsidiaries; and•repurchase shares of our common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by us.For a discussion of KKR's share repurchase program, see Note 23 ""Equity"" in our financial statements.Capital CommitmentsThe agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy for our Principal Activities business line, including core investments and exposure to the Asia-Pacific region.196Table of ContentsThe following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds and other vehicles as of December 31, 2022: UncalledCommitmentsPrivate Equity($ in millions)Core Investment Vehicles$3,883 European Fund VI750 Asian Fund IV367 North America Fund XIII359 Next Generation Technology Growth Fund III196 Global Impact Fund II145 Health Care Strategic Growth Fund II127 Other Private Equity Vehicles1,543 Total Private Equity Commitments7,370 Real AssetsAsia Pacific Infrastructure Investors II357 Global Infrastructure Investors IV272 Asia Real Estate Partners162 Real Estate Partners Americas III91 Diversified Core Infrastructure Fund87 Real Estate Partners Europe II81 Real Estate Credit Opportunity Partners II17 Other Real Assets Vehicles782 Total Real Assets Commitments1,849 Credit and Liquid StrategiesAsset-Based Finance Partners97 Asia Credit97 Dislocation Opportunities Fund84 Lending Partners III12 Lending Partners Europe II11 Other Credit and Liquid Strategies Vehicles916 Total Credit and Liquid Strategies Commitments1,217 Total Uncalled Commitments$10,436 Other CommitmentsIn addition to the uncalled commitments to our investment funds as shown above, KKR has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and equity syndications in our Capital Markets business line. As of December 31, 2022, these commitments amounted to $0.7 billion.Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. Our capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which reduce our risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022 have been reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third parties. In the case of purchases of investments or assets in our Principal Activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less. For more information about our Capital Markets business line's risks, see ""Risks Related to Our Business—Our capital markets activities expose us to material risks."" 197Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the arranging or underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, for which we may draw all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities. We generally expect these borrowings by our Capital Markets business line to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. For more information about our Capital Markets business line's risks, see ""Risks Related to Our Business—Our capital markets activities expose us to material risks"" in this report.Tax Receivable AgreementOn May 30, 2022, KKR terminated the tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings other than with respect to exchanges of KKR Holdings Units completed prior to such date. As of December 31, 2022, an undiscounted payable of $420.6 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed for certain exchanges of KKR Holdings Units that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $60.4 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement since inception.DividendsA dividend of $0.155 per share of our common stock has been declared and will be paid on March 7, 2023 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on February 17, 2023.A dividend of $0.75 per share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has been declared and set aside for payment on March 15, 2023 to holders of record of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2023. When KKR & Co. Inc. receives distributions from KKR Group Partnership, holders of exchangeable securities receive their pro rata share of such distributions from KKR Group Partnership. The declaration and payment of dividends to our common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. We announced on February 7, 2023 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.66 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share) beginning with the dividend to be announced with the results for the first quarter of 2023. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including KKR’s future financial performance and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of KKR & Co. Inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for U.S. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. Furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by KKR Group Partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the terms of the preferred units of KKR Group Partnership.Contractual Obligations, Commitments and ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we (including Global Atlantic) and our consolidated funds and CFEs enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. Contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries. In addition, we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. For more information about these contingent liabilities, please see Note 25 ""Commitments and Contingencies"" in our financial statements.198Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2022 excluding consolidated funds and CFEs with a reconciliation of such amounts to anticipated future cash payments by us (including Global Atlantic) and our consolidated funds and CFEs.

Global Atlantic's debt obligations are non-recourse to KKR beyond the assets of Global Atlantic.(8)Policy liabilities for insurance obligations consist of amounts required to meet future obligations for future policy benefits and policy account balances. Amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, including significant assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums, mortality, lapse, renewal, withdrawal, and annuitization comparable with actual experience. These assumptions also include market growth and policy crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing DAC. All estimated cash payments are not discounted to present value. Accordingly, the total of cash flows presented for all years of $170.1 billion significantly exceeds total policy liabilities of $141.2 billion recorded on the statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2022. Estimated cash payments are also presented gross of reinsurance. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could differ materially from actual results.(9)The payments due by period for debt obligations reflects the contractual maturities of principal.

Future interest on variable rate debt (which includes borrowing under our revolving credit facility and the subordinated debentures) was computed using prevailing rates as of December 31, 2022 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations.199Table of Contents(11)Reflects operational servicing agreements with third-party administrators for policy administration.(12)Represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding KKR's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See ""—Liquidity Needs"" and Note 17 ""Debt Obligations"" in our financial statements.(13)Amounts include (i) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of providing liquidity to the funds of $9.0 billion, (ii) debt securities issued by our consolidated CLOs of $22.3 billion and (iii) borrowings collateralized by fund investments, fund co-investments and other assets held by levered investment vehicles of $2.3 billion. Debt securities issued by consolidated CLO entities are supported solely by the investments held at the CLO vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Borrowings by levered investment vehicles are supported solely by the investments held at the investment vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other KKR entity. Obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. Our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds.(14)Represents a debt obligation in connection with the ownership of KKR office space.

The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.The commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. See ""—Liquidity Needs—Tax Receivable Agreement"" in this report and ""Risk Factors—We will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from certain prior exchanges of our common stock for KKR Group Partnership Units"" in this report. Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, capital allocation-based income (loss), expenses, investment income, and income taxes. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements included in this report.Basis of AccountingWe consolidate the financial results of KKR Group Partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, Global Atlantic’s insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds and certain other entities including CFEs.When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of Net Income Attributable to KKR or KKR's stockholders' equity that KKR reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under GAAP. This is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations.200Table of ContentsThe presentation in the financial statements reflect the significant industry diversification of KKR by its acquisition of Global Atlantic. Global Atlantic operates an insurance business, and KKR operates an asset management business, each of which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, KKR developed a two-tiered presentation approach for the financial statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. KKR believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations. KKR believes that reporting Global Atlantic’s insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of Global Atlantic’s policy liabilities, which are not obligations of KKR (other than the insurance companies that issued them). If a traditional aggregated presentation were to be used, KKR would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations but would reduce transparency. KKR also believes that using a traditional aggregated presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report. We acquired Global Atlantic on February 1, 2021; accordingly, the results of Global Atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 are from February 1, 2021 (the closing date of the GA Acquisition) through December 31, 2021.ConsolidationKKR consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. For a detailed description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" in our financial statements included in this report. As part of its consolidation procedures, KKR evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the KKR’s involvement would make it the primary beneficiary. The determination that KKR holds a controlling financial interest in an investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. The assessment of whether we consolidate an investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with an investment vehicle and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: •Determining whether our management fees, carried interests or incentive fees represent variable interests - We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. •Determining whether a legal entity qualifies as a VIE - For those entities where KKR holds a variable interest, management determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a VIE and, if so, whether or not KKR is the primary beneficiary. The assessment of whether the entity is a VIE is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. These judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties’ equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity. Entities that do not qualify as VIEs are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. Under the voting interest entity model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. •Concluding whether KKR has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE - As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” we must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.Changes to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity.Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. 201Table of ContentsGAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:Level IPricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level IIPricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.Level IIIPricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. The valuation of our Level III investments at December 31, 2022 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Level III Valuation MethodologiesOur investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. Additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. Across the total Level III private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 55% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of this Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2022, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of Level III private equity investments were 38%, 55%, and 7%, respectively.There is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of Level III investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, KKR will realize the values reflected in our valuations. Our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. See ""—Business Environment"" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations. Key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III valuations as described above are included in Note 10 ""Fair Value Measurements"" in our financial statements.Level III Valuation ProcessThe valuation process involved for Level III measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.For private equity and real asset investments classified as Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. KKR begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its Level III assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and KKR follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its Level III assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. These preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations annually for all Level III private equity and real asset investments and quarterly for 202Table of Contentsinvestments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of KKR's Level III private equity and real asset investments. The valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. For credit investments, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by KKR to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as Level III. The valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which KKR's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations. After reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by KKR's valuation committees. As of December 31, 2022, less than 3% of the total value of our Level III credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.For Level III investments in Asset Management, KKR has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. The global valuation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure and credit. The asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary Level III valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. The members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. All Level III valuations for investments in Asset Management are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes KKR's Co-Chief Executive Officers and its Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. When valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and are then reported to the Board of Directors.Level III investments held by Global Atlantic are valued on the basis of pricing services, broker-dealers or internal models. Global Atlantic performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from independent pricing services as well as broker-dealers to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of these investments were priced via external sources, while approximately 13% were valued on the basis of internal models. For all the internally developed models, Global Atlantic seeks to verify the reasonableness of fair values by analyzing the inputs and other assumptions used. These preliminary valuations are reviewed, based on certain thresholds, by an independent valuation firm engaged by Global Atlantic to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of Global Atlantic's valuations. When valuations are approved by Global Atlantic's management, the valuations of its Level III investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of KKR & Co. Inc. and are then reported to the Board of Directors.As of December 31, 2022, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain Level III investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by KKR (including Global Atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all Level III investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. As described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time.Changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in Asset Management and through our consolidated funds as described below. We estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of 203Table of Contentscarried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. With respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments. With respect to Insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact KKR only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in Global Atlantic.As of December 31, 2022, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, as of December 31, 2022, investments which represented greater than 5% of total non-GAAP investments consisted of USI, Inc. and PetVet Care Centers, LLC and valued at $1,300 million and $1,143 million, respectively. Our investment income on a GAAP basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of Crescent Energy. See ""—Business Environment"" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results and valuations, and ""—Non-GAAP Balance Sheet Measures"" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a non-GAAP basis.Business CombinationsKKR accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Management’s determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and outflows, future fundraising assumptions, expected useful life, discount rates and income tax rates. Our estimates for future cash flows are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying assets acquired. We estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual result.Income TaxesSignificant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that KKR uses to manage its business. As of December 31, 2022, a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized. For that portion of the deferred tax assets for Global Atlantic, a valuation allowance has been recorded. Revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. Please see Note 19 ""Income Taxes"" in our financial statements in this report for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Asset ManagementRevenuesFees and OtherFees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, CLOs, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; and (v) consulting fees. These 204Table of Contentsfees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.Transaction fee calculations and management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital typically do not require discretion and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the investment vehicles. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions.Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)Capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby KKR serves as general partner and includes income or loss from KKR's capital interest as well as ""carried interest"" which entitles KKR to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners. Carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds’ investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in their partnership agreement. KKR recognizes revenues attributable to capital allocation-based income based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized reflects KKR’s share of the gains and losses of the associated funds’ underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring the fair value of investments in the absence of observable market prices as previously discussed, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. ExpensesCompensation and BenefitsCompensation and Benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation and (v) discretionary cash bonuses.To supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in Compensation and Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. We accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income and other factors determined during the year.Beginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues. Based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expect to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees to pay our asset management employees. Because these ranges are applied to applicable asset management segment revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total asset management segment revenue will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. We decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. There is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances.Assuming that we had accrued compensation of (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized net gains in our Principal Activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the ranges above), KKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders’ Equity – Common Stock as of December 31, 2022 would have been reduced by approximately $1.46 per share, compared to our reported $19.29 per share on such date, and our book value as of December 31, 2022 would have been reduced by approximately $1.42 per adjusted share, compared to our reported book value of $26.73 per adjusted share on such date.205Table of ContentsCarry Pool AllocationWith respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to a carry pool established at KKR Associates Holdings L.P., which is not a KKR subsidiary, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. The allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between KKR Associates Holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and are recorded as compensation expense. Upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. Accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments.In February 2021, with the approval of a majority of our independent directors, KKR amended the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool to 65% for (i) current investment funds for which no or de minimis amounts of carried interest was accrued as of December 31, 2020 and (ii) all future funds. For all other funds, the percentage of carried interest remains 40% or 43%, as applicable. The percentage of carried interest allocable to the carry pool may be increased above 65% only with the approval of a majority of our independent directors. To account for the difference in the carry pool allocation percentages, we expect to use a portion of realized carried interest from the older funds equal to the difference between 65% and 40% or 43%, as applicable, to supplement the carry pool and to pay amounts as discretionary cash bonus compensation as described above to our asset management employees. The amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus at all for certain employees. See ""—Revenues—Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss)"" and ""—Compensation and Benefits"" above.On the Sunset Date (which will not be later than December 31, 2026), KKR will acquire control of KKR Associates Holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of KKR Associates Holdings. Until the Sunset Date, our Co-Founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of KKR Associates Holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the Co-Founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice. For additional information about the Sunset Date and the Reorganization Agreement, please see ""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence"" in this report.Equity-based CompensationIn addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our Equity Incentive Plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. Certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements.Compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards is measured at fair value on the grant date. In determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly for certain restricted units with a vesting condition based upon market conditions, whose grant date fair values are based on a probability distributed Monte-Carlo simulation. See Note 20 ""Equity Based Compensation,” in our financial statements included in this report for further discussion and activity of these awards.Investment Income (Loss) -Net Gains (Losses) from Investment ActivitiesNet gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see the above ""—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Fair Value Measurements.""206Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates – InsurancePolicy liabilitiesPolicy liabilities (collectively, ""reserves,"") are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. Interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. Global Atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts.Global Atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. These assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), credit spreads, mortality, longevity, and persistency.The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. Global Atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. This would result in a charge to our net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs.For a majority of Global Atlantic's in-force policies, including its universal life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. For these products, the account value represents its obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held on deposit. However, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, universal life products with secondary guarantees, indexed universal life and preneed policies.Guaranteed minimum death benefits (""GMDB"")Some of Global Atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a GMDB feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. This amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. If the GMDB is higher than the current account value at the time of death, Global Atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference.Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (""GMWB"")Global Atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. GMWB are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year.Once exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. A policyholder’s annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. The benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula or index credits. Any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. Global Atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero.The ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. For fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that Global Atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually.207Table of ContentsGMDB and GMWB sensitivitiesAs of December 31, 2022, the GMDB and GMWB liability balance totaled $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the liability balances for GMDB were $36.0 million for fixed-indexed annuities and $33.8 million for variable annuities. As of December 31, 2022, the liability balances for GMWB were $1.2 billion for fixed-indexed annuities. The increase (decrease) to the GMDB and GMWB liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in projected assessments, equity market prices, and annual equity growth is summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.December 31, 2022($ in thousands)Balance$1,252,206 Hypothetical change:'+10% future assessments(1)(27,887)'-10% future assessments(1)31,696 +10% equity market prices(18,298)-10% equity market prices9,730 1% lower annual equity growth4,918 ________________Note: Hypothetical changes to the liability balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges.(1)The assessments used to accrue liabilities are generally based on investment yields, realized gains and losses, rider charges, surrender charges, and asset-based fees, such as mortality and expense fees.Embedded derivativesGlobal Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value.The embedded derivative is calculated as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. In addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect the risk of non-performance on Global Atlantic's obligations (i.e., own credit risk).Changes in interest rates, future index credits, Global Atlantic's own credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life contracts can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative.Valuation of embedded derivatives – Fixed-indexed annuitiesFixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the S&P 500 Index, or other indexes. The market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. The projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. The projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate adjusted by a non-performance risk spread tied to Global Atlantic's own credit rating. 208Table of ContentsValuation of embedded derivatives – Indexed universal lifeIndexed universal life products allow a policyholder’s account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which result in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. The embedded derivative related to the index is bifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. The valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. Present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. The discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate plus a non-performance risk spread tied to Global Atlantic’s own credit rating. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative.Valuation of embedded derivatives – Variable annuitiesVariable annuity contracts offered and assumed by Global Atlantic provide the contractholder with GMDB and/or GMWB. The liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operation. Global Atlantic has issued variable annuity contracts with GMDB features. Global Atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts, valued at $394.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the GMDB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own credit risk.Global Atlantic also issues variable annuity contracts with a GMWB. The GMWB feature represents an embedded derivative. The embedded derivative is required to be bifurcated and measured at fair value. This liability is calculated as the present value of the excess GMWB claims less the present value of GMWB fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. Global Atlantic discounts the cash flows using U.S. Treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own company credit risk.As of December 31, 2022, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $1.9 billion for fixed-indexed annuities, $337.9 million for indexed universal life and $2.3 million for variable annuities. As of December 31, 2022, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option was $394.6 million. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity, indexed universal life, and variable annuity products and the increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, non-performance risk premium, and equity market prices is summarized in the table below. This sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances.As of December 31, 2022FIAIULVAVA (FVO)($ in thousands)Balance$1,853,031 $337,860 $2,335 $394,638 Hypothetical change:+50 bps interest rates(44,023)(5,524)(38,491)(20,995)-50 bps interest rates46,270 4,122 47,277 22,609 '+50bps non-performance risk premium(44,023)(5,524)(15,142)(13,534)'-50bps non-performance risk premium46,270 4,122 18,599 14,575 +10% equity market prices338,258 61,879 (25,892)(9,826)-10% equity market prices(166,396)(50,597)28,771 9,826 ________________Note: Hypothetical changes to the liability balances do not reflect the impact of related hedges.Valuation of embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance or funds withheldGlobal Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company’s return on a designated portfolio of assets. Because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded 209Table of Contentsderivatives, which are measured at fair value. Global Atlantic is exposed to both the interest rate and credit risk of the assets. Changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line items on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations.As of December 31, 2022, the embedded derivative balance for modified coinsurance or funds withheld arrangements was a $3,500 million net asset ($12.8 million in funds withheld receivables at interest, and $(3,487.8) million in funds withheld payable at interest). The increase (decrease) to the balance as a result of hypothetical changes in credit spreads and interest rates is summarized in the table below.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to movements in the fair value of investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest, and net gains from investment activities. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Additionally, interest rate movements can adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive on credit instruments bearing variable rates and could also impact the amount of interest that we pay on debt obligations bearing variable rates. Following our acquisition of Global Atlantic, we expect to be affected by market risks arising from Global Atlantic’s business. Global Atlantic has material exposure to market volatility in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices through its insurance liabilities, many of which are structured to have exposure to market level changes, its investment portfolio and its hedge program. The quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate. The actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below. Management of Market Risk Asset ManagementWhen we commit capital from our Principal Activities business line to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our Co-Executive Chairmen, one of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, and the Chief Financial Officer, must approve the investment or transaction before it may be made. The committee has delegated authority to other senior employees to approve certain investments or transactions, subject to maximum commitment sizes or other limitations determined by the committee. In addition, this committee supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and the composition of our balance sheet.Certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements, and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Exchange Act. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example, and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk and capital deployed for transactions are monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above.With respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee or portfolio manager; a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) then regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data, and other information relevant to a particular investment. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee or a portfolio manager, which must approve each investment before it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other designated senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis.InsuranceThe board of directors of TGAFG, which is the holding company for Global Atlantic, has established a risk committee that has primary oversight of market risk at Global Atlantic. This risk committee has adopted Global Atlantic’s risk appetite principles that form the foundation of Global Atlantic’s enterprise risk management program. The risk appetite principles include: (1) protect policyholders by seeking to maintain adequate capital and liquidity resources to honor its obligations to policyholders under situations reflecting stress scenarios calibrated to the worst modern economic cycles; (2) deliver value by remaining in a position of strength during periods of adverse market conditions, and (3) protect the franchise by identifying and cost-effectively managing risks that could adversely and materially impact franchise value. The Global Atlantic enterprise risk management program formalizes the review of financial and non-financial risks and establishes risk management controls. Global Atlantic monitors risks on an aggregate, legal entity and product basis, monitoring different factors, including financial and insurance, investment, hedge management, operational, and legal, compliance and regulatory risks to confirm that its risks remain within established risk limits and tolerances.For a discussion of Global Atlantic's hedge program, see ""—Insurance Segment Market Risks—Hedge Program.""211Table of ContentsManagement of General Business RiskAsset ManagementKKR has a risk and operations committee comprised of senior employees from across our Asset Management business and operations, and it includes our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer. The risk and operations committee focuses on KKR's operations and enterprise risk management. This committee is aided by various other committees focused on the oversight of risks to our business, including a global conflicts and compliance committee. This committee focuses on the most significant operating and business risks, which includes, among others, regulatory, cyber, operational, geopolitical, and reputational risks. KKR has a global conflicts and compliance committee comprised of senior employees from across our Asset Management business and operations, and it includes, among others, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. The global conflicts and compliance committee focuses on new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including, but not limited to, conflicts relating to specific transactions as well as potential conflicts involving the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses. This committee also reviews and monitors certain compliance matters.KKR's technology and information security committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring global technology risks including information security, business disruption and fraud related risks.In addition, KKR has other committees comprised of senior employees across our Asset Management business and operations that consider potential risks to our business.InsuranceThe TGAFG board of directors is responsible for oversight and the overall governance of Global Atlantic's business and operations. The TGAFG board includes among its members one of our Co-Chief Executive Officers. To assist with its oversight of Global Atlantic, the TGAFG board of directors has established an audit, risk, investment, operations & technology, nominating & governance, compensation and special transaction review committee.Asset Management Segment Market RisksThe following is a discussion of the significant market risk exposures for KKR's Asset Management business.Changes in Fair ValueThe majority of our investments as of December 31, 2022, are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on investments held as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a significant portion of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the consolidated statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CFEs.212Table of ContentsBased on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2023 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors:Management FeesCarried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)Hypothetical 10% Decline in Fair Value of Investments (1)$43,743 (2)$714,236 (3)$1,757,368 (3)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our incentive fees are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees may have been earned.(2)Represents an annualized reduction in management fees.(3)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.Management FeesOur management fees in our Private Equity and Real Assets business lines are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under ""Business—Our Business—Private Equity"" and ""Business—Our Business—Real Assets."" Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not significantly affect the amount of fees we may charge in Private Equity and Real Assets funds. Management fees in our infrastructure funds are calculated based on the NAV of the fund and, in some cases, we additionally earn management fees on the fund's remaining commitment. In the case of our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund for that particular period, although certain funds in our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line have management fees based on the amount of capital invested. In the case of our CLO vehicles, management fees are calculated based on the collateral of the vehicle. The collateral is based on the par value of the investments and cash on hand.To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will increase or decrease in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the fund management fees that were recognized based on the NAV of the applicable funds was approximately 17%.Publicly Traded Securities Our investment funds and KKR's balance sheet hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions, and dispositions. In addition, although a substantial portion of our investments are comprised of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these privately held investments may also fluctuate as our Level III investments are valued in part using a market comparables analysis. Consequently, due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded, the value of these Level III investments may fluctuate with market prices. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Environment.""213Table of ContentsExchange Rate Risk Our investment funds, CLO vehicles, and KKR's balance sheet hold investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. Our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (including euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, among others), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of carried interest as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of certain investment funds and CLO vehicles. We estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as of December 31, 2022 (i.e., an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies) would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. before income taxes in 2023 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors:Carried Interest, Net of Carry Pool AllocationNet Gains/(Losses) From Investment Activities Including General Partner Capital Interest($ in thousands)Hypothetical 10% Decline in Foreign Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar (1)$110,914 (2)$231,732 (2)(1)An immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would not be expected to materially impact our management fees or incentive fees. The majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, our management fees that are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies are generally hedged.(2)Decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. With respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.Interest Rate Risk Valuation of Investments Changes in credit markets and in particular, interest rates, can impact investment valuations, particularly our Level III investments, and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. 214Table of ContentsInterest Income We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, hold credit investments that generate interest income based on variable interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to investments that generate yield since a meaningful portion of credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds, including CLOs, earn income based on variable interest rates. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this decrease would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and CLO third party noteholders. Interest Expense We and certain consolidated funds, including CLOs, have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements, certain investment financing arrangements and debt securities issued by CLO vehicles that accrue interest at variable rates. Changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that our consolidated funds, including CLOs, would have to make. With respect to consolidated funds and CLOs, the impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this increase would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and third party CLO noteholders. With respect to debt obligations held by KKR and not in the consolidated funds or CLOs, as of December 31, 2022, KKR had debt obligations outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $258.5 million that accrues interest at a variable rate. Our policy is to reduce these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using interest rate swaps. The impact on net income attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense, net of the impact of interest rate hedging strategies, would not be expected to be material.Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to reduce our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. 215Table of ContentsInsurance Segment Market RisksThe following is a discussion of the significant market risk exposures for Global Atlantic.Hedge ProgramTo manage market risk, Global Atlantic established a hedge program that seeks to mitigate economic impacts primarily from interest rate and equity price movements, while taking into consideration accounting and capital impacts. For Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to use static hedges to offset the exposure primarily created by changes in embedded derivative balances. For Global Atlantic's variable annuity policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to dynamically hedge its exposure to changes in the value of the guarantee Global Atlantic provides to policyholders. In the context of specific reinsurance or other transactions in Global Atlantic's institutional channel or strategic acquisitions, Global Atlantic may also enters into hedges which are designed to limit short-term market risks to the economic value of the target assets. From time to time, Global Atlantic also enters into hedges designed to limit the volatility associated with changes in the value of its general account assets or changes to net investment income as a result of interest rate or credit spread movements, while also taking into consideration economic impacts. While not the primary focus of its hedging strategy, Global Atlantic also enters into currency swaps and forwards to manage foreign exchange rate risks with respect to certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. Global Atlantic also enters into inflation swaps to manage inflation risk associated with inflation-indexed preneed policies. Where Global Atlantic has derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, these derivative instruments receive hedge accounting.Global Atlantic's hedge program is not designed to, and may not be effective in, offsetting all impacts to net income, assets under management, statutory capital or economic values. Movements in market variables other than interest rates and equity market prices that are not explicitly hedged can also cause net income volatility. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Business Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Global Atlantic's use of derivative financial instruments within its risk management strategy may not be effective or sufficient."" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Business Risks Related to Global Atlantic—Global Atlantic may experience volatility in its net income under GAAP due to its funds withheld coinsurance transactions"" in this report.SensitivitiesGlobal Atlantic evaluates the sensitivity of net income to specific changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices projected using internal models. All of the estimated sensitivities assume that all other factors remain constant and reflect the impact of related hedges assuming no hedge rebalancing in Global Atlantic's dynamic program, as explained further below.Global Atlantic's internal models project impacts as of a specific date, and are measured relative to a starting level reflecting its assets and liabilities at that date and the actuarial factors, investment activity, and assumed investment returns associated with insurance liabilities. The models measure the impact of changing one factor at a time and assume that all other factors remain unchanged. Actual results can differ significantly from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including the interaction among these factors when more than one changes, discretionary actions by management in response to such changes, differences between the return of the underlying fund and the return on the index being hedged, actual experience differing from the assumptions, changes in business mix, effective tax rates and other market factors, and limitations inherent in the use of models. For these reasons, the sensitivities should only be viewed as directional estimates of the impacts on Global Atlantic's net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI""), and actual changes in response to such scenarios may differ materially from estimates provided.For the dynamic portion of the hedge program, Global Atlantic primarily uses interest rate and equity futures to hedge liabilities which have option-like embedded derivatives. As such, Global Atlantic's program requires frequent rebalancing as markets move to ensure that the hedges are being re-sized to the new liability exposure. In addition, certain of the underlying variable annuity separate account funds are managed volatility funds, so Global Atlantic's market exposures may change substantially after sharp market moves. The point-in-time estimates provided in this section assume no hedge rebalancing and, as such, the impact on Global Atlantic's consolidated net income may be different from what is shown below.Interest rate riskGlobal Atlantic is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in the level and volatility of interest rates. Changes in the level and volatility of interest rates primarily impacts the fair value reported in our consolidated financial statements of the following:216Table of Contents•embedded derivatives associated with modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld payables or receivables; •embedded derivatives associated with variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities and indexed universal life products; •policy liabilities accounted under the fair value option, and•financial instruments held in Global Atlantic's investment portfolio and used in its hedge program.Changes in fair value of the foregoing are generally recorded as gains or losses in the consolidated statement of operations, or in the statement of comprehensive income for unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. For specific derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted bond purchases and receiving hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to net investment income following the qualifying purchases of available-for-sale securities, as an adjustment to the yield earned over the life of the purchased securities, using the effective interest method.Due to the dynamic lapse sensitivities within Global Atlantic's models, market volatility in interest rates also impacts the reserves and deferred acquisition costs of certain fixed annuity products, changes in which are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.In periods following interest rate moves, Global Atlantic will also recognize a change in the income earned on certain of its floating-rate assets and the cost of funding on certain of Global Atlantic's liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.Effect of interest rate sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 50 basis point increase/(decrease) in interest rates, from a parallel shift in the yield curve, from levels as of December 31, 2022 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. These sensitivities include the impact of related hedges and adjustments to DAC attributable to interest rate changes.

Estimated sensitivity to a hypothetical change over 12 months does not take into account any management actions that may be taken to mitigate actual impacts.The estimated point in time impact is driven by a net decrease/(increase) in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with Global Atlantic's modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld payables and receivables and the embedded derivatives associated with its variable annuity, fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life products, and largely offset by a loss/(gain) in financial instruments used in its hedging program, investments classified as trading, and loans designated under the fair value option, based on balances in place at quarter end. These estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts. In addition, the point in time impact includes a decrease/(increase) in the value of the reserve and (decrease)/increase in the deferred acquisition cost balance of certain fixed annuity blocks of business due to the dynamic lapse sensitivities within Global Atlantic's models.The impact over 12 months is driven by an increase/(decrease) in the income earned on Global Atlantic's floating rate assets, and partially offset by an increase/(decrease) in the cost of its floating-rate liabilities.217Table of ContentsIn the table below we estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase/(decrease) in interest rates, for a parallel shift in the yield curve, from levels as of December 31, 2022 to Global Atlantic's AOCI.December 31, 2022Hypothetical change+50 Basis points-50 Basis points($ in thousands)Total estimated AOCI sensitivity (point in time)$(1,276,273)$1,351,119 The estimated point in time impact is driven by a net (decrease)/increase in the value of Global Atlantic's available-for-sale fixed maturity securities which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of certain offsets, reported in AOCI. The estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts.Credit spread riskGlobal Atlantic is exposed to credit spread risk as a result of changes in the spread between the yields on its funds withheld payables and receivables at interest and yields on comparable U.S. Treasury securities. Global Atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance arrangements. Such arrangements are deemed to contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value, and are therefore impacted by the mark-to-market value of the related assets. Changes in the credit spreads associated with the assets impact the mark-to-market value of the assets. There is additional credit spread risk exposure inherent in Global Atlantic's own credit spread used in valuing embedded derivative liabilities, which serves to mitigate net credit exposure. Global Atlantic may choose to enter into hedge positions to manage credit spread risk. As of December 31, 2022, Global Atlantic had a $929 thousand credit derivative position.Effect of credit spread sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 50 basis points increase/(decrease) in credit spreads from levels as of December 31, 2022 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. These estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenues and expenses and related income tax impacts and include impacts on our own credit spread used in valuing embedded derivative liabilities.December 31, 2022Hypothetical change+50 Basis points-50 Basis points($ in thousands)Total estimated net income and shareholders’ equity excluding AOCI sensitivity (point in time)$236,276 $(250,355)Equity price riskGlobal Atlantic is exposed to equity price risk as a result of changes in the level and volatility of equity prices.Changes in the level and volatility of equity prices primarily impacts the fair value reported in the consolidated financial statements of the following:•embedded derivatives and policy liabilities associated with Global Atlantic's variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities and indexed universal life products; •financial instruments held in Global Atlantic's investment portfolio and used in its hedge program; and•certain of Global Atlantic's alternative assets.Changes in fair value of the foregoing are recorded as gains or losses in our consolidated statements of operations.In addition, certain of the fees Global Atlantic earns, and benefits Global Atlantic pays in its variable annuity and variable universal life blocks are calculated on the account values, which are exposed to equity price risk. These changes impact our net income over the periods following equity price moves.218Table of ContentsEffect of equity price sensitivityIn the table below, Global Atlantic estimates the impact of a 10% increase/(decrease) in equity prices from levels as of December 31, 2022 to its net income and shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. These sensitivities include the impact of related hedges but exclude the potential impact of alternative assets, because the fair value of these investments do not necessarily move directly in line with movements in public equity markets.December 31, 2022Hypothetical change(1)+10% Equity Prices-10% Equity Prices($ in thousands)Total estimated net income and shareholders’ equity excluding AOCI sensitivity (point in time)$(24,425)$40,929 Total estimated net income and shareholders’ equity excluding AOCI sensitivity (over 12 months)(2)4,442 (4,834)(1)From time to time, Global Atlantic may choose to enter into additional hedges to mitigate economic exposure to equity markets.(2)Excludes point in time impact. Estimated sensitivity to a hypothetical change over 12 months does not take into account any management actions that may be taken to mitigate actual impacts. The estimated point-in-time impact is driven by an increase/(decrease) in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with Global Atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life products, and largely offset by a decrease / (increase) in Global Atlantic's variable annuity embedded derivatives and policy benefits, and gains or losses on financial instruments used in Global Atlantic's hedging program. These estimated changes include the impact of related amortization of deferred revenue and expenses and related income tax impacts.For a discussion of current market conditions, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Environment."" 219Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:24:14.104205
