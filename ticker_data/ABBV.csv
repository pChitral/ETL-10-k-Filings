1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) and results of operations as of and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie develops and markets advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie products are used to treat chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease; low testosterone; HIV; endometriosis; thyroid disease; Parkinson's disease; and complications associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cystic fibrosis, among other health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines, including more than 20 compounds or indications in Phase II or Phase III development across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases and women's health. In the United States, AbbVie's products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 25,000 employees and its products are sold in over 170 countries. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. Financial Results In its first full year as an independent company, AbbVie achieved its key objectives, including strong sales growth of HUMIRA and other key products, operational efficiencies and progress in advancing its pipeline, particularly with its late-stage hepatitis C virus (HCV) program. Worldwide net sales in 2013 totaled $18.8 billion, an increase of 2 percent, despite the loss of exclusivity in the company's lipid franchise during the year. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, July 2013 for TRILIPIX and September 2013 for Niaspan, resulting in the loss of $1.1 billion of revenue in 2013 over the prior year. The company's financial performance also included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $2.56, while accelerating its investment in research and development and increasing sales and marketing support for new and existing products. In 2013, the company generated cash flows from operations of $6.3 billion. These strong cash flows enabled the company to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities and to pay cash dividends to shareholders of $2.6 billion in 2013. In 2014, AbbVie plans to continue to invest in key products, advance its pipeline and prepare for anticipated product launches that are expected to drive growth in 2015 and beyond. Strategic Objectives AbbVie's long-term strategy is to maximize its existing portfolio of products through new indications, share gains, increased geographic expansion in underserved markets while also advancing its new product pipeline to meet unmet medical needs. To successfully execute its long-term strategy, AbbVie will focus on expanding HUMIRA sales, advancing the pipeline, expanding its presence in emerging markets and managing its product portfolio to maximize value. 35 AbbVie expects to continue to drive strong HUMIRA sales growth in several ways. AbbVie seeks to expand the HUMIRA patient base by applying for regulatory approval of new indications for HUMIRA, treating conditions such as uveitis, hidradenitis suppurativa and pediatric Crohn's disease. AbbVie will also seek to drive HUMIRA sales growth by expanding its market share and its presence in underserved markets. Research and development (R&D) efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology, virology, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases and women's health. AbbVie's scientists work to advance a pipeline of specialty molecules that demonstrate strong clinical performance for patients and economic value for patients and their healthcare systems. Current R&D projects are described in the ""Research and Development"" section below. AbbVie plans to continue making investments in key emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Mexico and Russia. Continued penetration of HUMIRA and other leading products is expected to help drive growth in these markets. AbbVie will continue its investment in products with durable sales, while making adjustments as necessary to increase the value of its product portfolio. AbbVie plans to achieve this objective in a variety of ways depending on product and circumstances by, for example, identifying supply chain efficiencies, pursuing additional indications, and optimizing residual value as products reach the end of exclusivity. AbbVie believes that its approach will allow the company to maintain a strong operating margin. Research and Development Research and innovation continues to be a key strategic priority for AbbVie. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline includes more than 20 compounds or indications in Phase II or III development individually or under collaboration or license agreements. Of these programs, approximately 10 are in Phase III development or in registration. AbbVie expects several Phase II programs to transition into Phase III programs during 2014. R&D is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, virology, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases, and women's health, among others. Immunology HUMIRA is currently approved for ten indications in major geographies, including nine indications in Europe and seven in the United States. AbbVie continues to dedicate R&D efforts to expanding indications for HUMIRA, including in the fields of gastroenterology, dermatology and ophthalmology. Registration submissions and regulatory approvals for HUMIRA in 2013 included approval for two new gastroenterology indications in Japan—intestinal Behcet's and ulcerative colitis. Phase III trials are ongoing in preparation for regulatory applications of HUMIRA for uveitis and hidradenitis suppurativa in the United States and the European Union. The results of AbbVie's two fully-enrolled Phase III clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HUMIRA for patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in the United States are expected in 2014. The FDA issued a Complete Response Letter to the company's registration submission for axial spondyloarthritis, which is currently under evaluation by the company. 36 AbbVie also has a number of next-generation programs underway to address immune-mediated conditions, including the following. •AbbVie's studies of dual variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) technology, which represents an approach that can target multiple disease-causing antigens with a single biologic agent, continue to progress. This proprietary technology could lead to next-generation biologic treatments for complex conditions such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, where multiple pathways are involved in the disease. •AbbVie is collaborating with Biotest AG on an anti-CD4 biologic known as tregalizumab. The compound is currently in Phase IIb clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. •GLPG0634, a next-generation, oral Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, is being developed with Galapagos NV (Galapagos) in a collaboration entered into during the first quarter of 2012. GLPG0634 is currently in Phase IIb development to treat rheumatoid arthritis and may be able to address other autoimmune diseases. In January 2014, a Phase II study to evaluate GLPG0634 to treat Crohn's disease was initiated. •In September 2013, AbbVie entered into a global collaboration with Ablynx NV (Ablynx) to develop and commercialize the anti-IL-6R Nanobody, ALX-0061, to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. ALX-0061 is currently in Phase II development for rheumatoid arthritis. •In May 2013, AbbVie entered into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop ALV003, a novel oral treatment for patients with celiac disease. ALV003 is currently in Phase IIb development. Virology In October 2012, AbbVie initiated a comprehensive Phase III program for genotype 1 HCV that involves combinations of ABT-450, a protease inhibitor for HCV infection; ABT-333, a polymerase inhibitor; and ABT-267, a NS5A inhibitor. In December 2013 and January 2014, AbbVie disclosed top-line results from all six of these registrational studies. AbbVie expects to complete regulatory submissions in the United States and the European Union in the second quarter of 2014 and anticipates commercialization in the United States before the end of 2014. AbbVie also initiated Phase III development in Japan for HCV infection and expects to submit a regulatory application in Japan in 2015. AbbVie also recently initiated Phase II studies of its next-generation HCV program which includes ABT-493, a potent protease inhibitor, and ABT-530, AbbVie's new NS5A inhibitor. Oncology AbbVie is focused on the development of targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies. AbbVie's later-stage oncology pipeline includes the following. •Elotuzumab, an anti-CD37 antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma under a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Phase III development began in June 2011 for multiple myeloma. Two Phase III studies are ongoing with results expected in early 2015. •Veliparib (ABT-888), a PARP-inhibitor. A Phase IIb study in BRCA-mutated breast cancer being treated with chemotherapy was initiated in 2011. Veliparib is also in Phase II evaluation for the treatment of a variety of other solid tumors, including brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer being treated with radiation therapy and non-small-cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. In January 2014, a Phase III clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the safety and 37 efficacy of Veliparib when added to carboplatin, a chemotherapy, in women with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer. •ABT-199, a next-generation Bcl-2 inhibitor in development for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In January 2014, a Phase III evaluation was initiated in collaboration with AbbVie's development partner, Roche Holding AG. AbbVie anticipates results from this trial in early 2015. ABT-199 is also being explored for use across a number of different hematologic cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. •Other molecular targets are being explored with Antibody-Drug Conjugate approaches linking anti-target antibodies with potent cytotoxic agents. Renal Disease AbbVie's renal care pipeline includes atrasentan, for the treatment of diabetic CKD. In 2013, a Phase III study was initiated to assess atrasentan, when added to standard of care, on progression of kidney disease in patients with stage 2 to 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes. This global registrational study is expected to be completed in 2017. Atrasentan will potentially be the first compound launched to treat diabetic nephropathy by specifically targeting albuminuria and slowing the progression of CKD. AbbVie is also investigating ABT-719, in Phase IIb development, for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac surgeries. Neurological Diseases AbbVie has clinical studies underway on multiple compounds that target receptors in the brain that help regulate mood, memory, and other neurological functions and conditions, including the following. •AbbVie is collaborating with Biogen Idec to develop daclizumab for the treatment of the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common form, and affects nearly 85 percent of newly diagnosed MS patients. Daclizumab, an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, is currently in Phase III development. •AbbVie recently completed two Phase IIb studies of ABT-126, an a7-NNR modulator, in both Alzheimer's disease and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Based on the results of these studies, AbbVie plans to focus its efforts on the schizophrenia indication. •A levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is under regulatory review in the United States and a decision is expected before the end of 2014. This product is sold under the name Duodopa outside the United States. Women's Health AbbVie is developing a novel oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, elagolix, under a collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain and uterine fibroids. A Phase III study in endometriosis began in mid-2012 and a Phase IIa study for uterine fibroids was initiated in November 2011. In 2013, AbbVie initiated a second Phase III trial for endometriosis and the study for uterine fibroids transitioned to Phase IIb. Other Given the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included R&D expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to AbbVie's total R&D expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new 38 product on AbbVie's overall market position. There were no delays in AbbVie's 2013 R&D activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon AbbVie's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, the nature and extent of cost-sharing arrangements, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. However, AbbVie plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve R&D spend equal to approximately 16 percent of net sales each year. AbbVie does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. Separation from Abbott Laboratories On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders (the separation). Each Abbott shareholder of record as of the close of business on December 12, 2012, received one share of AbbVie common stock for each Abbott common share held as of the record date. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012 and is comprised of Abbott's former research-based pharmaceuticals business. AbbVie's common stock began trading ""regular-way"" under the ticker symbol ""ABBV"" on the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013. Refer to the ""Basis of Historical Presentation"" section below for further information. Basis of Historical Presentation Prior to the separation, the historical financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Abbott's consolidated financial statements and accounting records as if the former research-based pharmaceutical business of Abbott had been part of AbbVie for all periods presented. Accordingly, AbbVie's financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect AbbVie's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of Abbott prior to the separation, in conformity with GAAP in the United States. The combined financial statements principally represent the historical results of operations and assets and liabilities of Abbott's Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment. The historical combined financial statements included the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at the Abbott corporate level but were specifically identifiable or allocable to AbbVie. Prior to 2012, cash and equivalents, short-term investments and restricted funds held by Abbott were not allocated to AbbVie unless those assets were held by an entity that was transferred to AbbVie. As of December 31, 2012, AbbVie's combined balance sheet reflected the direct holdings of AbbVie legal entities. Prior to 2012, long-term debt and short-term borrowings were not allocated to AbbVie as none of the debt recorded by Abbott was directly attributable to or guaranteed by AbbVie. In 2012, AbbVie issued $14.7 billion of long-term debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and $1.0 billion of commercial paper, which was reflected on AbbVie's combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. Prior to 2012, all intercompany transactions between AbbVie and Abbott were considered to be effectively settled in the historical combined financial statements at the time the transactions were recorded. As a result, the total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions was reflected in the combined statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 as a financing activity and in the combined balance sheet at December 31, 2012 as net parent company investment in AbbVie. As of December 31, 2012, outstanding transactions between AbbVie and Abbott 39 were reflected in the combined balance sheet outside of net parent company investment in AbbVie Inc. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the aggregate amount due from Abbott totaled $738 million and $696 million, respectively, and was classified in accounts and other receivables, net. The aggregate amount due to Abbott totaled $876 million and $923 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was classified in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The historical combined financial statements also reflected an allocation of expenses related to certain Abbott corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources, finance, information technology and quality assurance. These expenses were allocated to AbbVie based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount, square footage, number of transactions or other measures. AbbVie considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had AbbVie operated as an independent, stand-alone, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Percent change At actual currency rates At constant currency rates for the years ended (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012 United States $ 10,181 $ 10,435 $ 9,712 (2 )% 8 % (2 )% 8 % International 8,609 7,945 7,732 8 % 3 % 10 % 8 % Net sales $ 18,790 $ 18,380 $ 17,444 2 % 5 % 3 % 8 % The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Sales growth in 2013 was driven by the continued strength of HUMIRA, both in the United States and internationally as well as sales of key products including Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa. Sales increased in 2013 despite unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the loss of exclusivity for AbbVie's consolidated lipid franchise. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, in July 2013 for TRILIPIX and in September of 2013 for Niaspan. The increase in sales in 2012 was primarily due to higher HUMIRA sales, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and the entry of generic competition for TriCor in November 2012. 40 The following table details the sales of key products. Percent change At actual currency rates At constant currency rates years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012 HUMIRA United States $ 5,236 $ 4,377 $ 3,427 20 % 28 % 20 % 28 % International 5,423 4,888 4,505 11 % 8 % 12 % 15 % Total $ 10,659 $ 9,265 $ 7,932 15 % 17 % 15 % 21 % AndroGel United States $ 1,035 $ 1,152 $ 874 (10 )% 32 % (10 )% 32 % Kaletra United States $ 244 $ 279 $ 326 (13 )% (14 )% (13 )% (14 )% International 718 734 844 (2 )% (13 )% (1 )% (7 )% Total $ 962 $ 1,013 $ 1,170 (5 )% (13 )% (4 )% (9 )% Synagis International $ 827 $ 825 $ 775 — 6 % 9 % 9 % Lupron United States $ 566 $ 569 $ 540 (1 )% 5 % (1 )% 5 % International 219 231 270 (5 )% (14 )% (3 )% (11 )% Total $ 785 $ 800 $ 810 (2 )% (1 )% (1 )% — Synthroid United States $ 622 $ 551 $ 522 13 % 6 % 13 % 6 % Sevoflurane United States $ 77 $ 82 $ 88 (5 )% (7 )% (5 )% (7 )% International 491 520 577 (6 )% (10 )% (4 )% (5 )% Total $ 568 $ 602 $ 665 (6 )% (10 )% (4 )% (5 )% Creon United States $ 412 $ 353 $ 332 17 % 6 % 17 % 6 % Duodopa International $ 178 $ 149 $ 125 20 % 19 % 16 % 29 % Dyslipidemia products United States $ 1,076 $ 2,145 $ 2,504 (50 )% (14 )% (50 )% (14 )% Other $ 1,666 $ 1,525 $ 1,735 9 % (12 )% 10 % (11 )% Total $ 18,790 $ 18,380 $ 17,444 2 % 5 % 3 % 8 % On a constant currency basis, global HUMIRA sales increased 15 percent in 2013 and 21 percent in 2012 as a result of market expansion and higher market share across various countries, higher pricing in certain geographies and the global launch of the ulcerative colitis indication in 2012. HUMIRA sales continued to expand in the rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology categories. HUMIRA received approvals from the European Commission for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in April 2012, the treatment of severe axial spondyloarthritis in July 2012, and the treatment of pediatric patients with severe active Crohn's disease in November 2012. AbbVie is pursuing several new indications to help further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. AndroGel sales for 2013 were impacted by rebates implemented during the second half of 2012, certain account losses in early 2013 and continued moderation of market growth. The increase in AndroGel 41 sales in 2012 reflected higher prices, market share gains, the launch of AndroGel 1.62% in the second quarter of 2011, and volume growth in the U.S. testosterone replacement market. AndroGel continues to hold the number one market share position in the U.S. testosterone replacement market, with approximately 60 percent of the market share. AndroGel 1% sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in late 2014. Global sales of Kaletra declined in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of competition. Synthroid sales increased 13 percent and 6 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to strong brand loyalty and market leadership, and price. Sales of Sevoflurane were impacted in both years by generic competition. Sales of Creon in 2013 and 2012 grew by 17 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market and continued to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, the FDA approved Creon in a 36,000 lipase-unit dose for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Creon 36,000 is the highest dose of pancreatic therapy currently available. Sales of Duodopa, AbbVie's therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease currently approved in Europe and other international markets, increased 16 percent on a constant currency basis. Duodopa is currently under regulatory review in the United States and a regulatory decision is expected in 2014. Sales for AbbVie's consolidated lipid franchise, which includes TriCor, TRILIPIX and Niaspan, declined 50 percent in 2013 and 14 percent in 2012 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the U.S. market and, in 2012, softness in the overall branded cholesterol market. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, in July 2013 for TRILIPIX, and in September 2013 for Niaspan. AbbVie expects the negative impact of generic competition on sales to continue in 2014. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Gross margin $ 14,209 $ 13,872 $ 12,805 2 % 8 % as a % of net sales 76 % 75 % 73 % The gross profit margin in 2013 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio, including HUMIRA, operational efficiencies, price increases and lower amortization expense for intangible assets, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The increase in the gross profit margin in 2012 was primarily due to product mix, improved efficiencies, higher prices in certain geographies, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by pricing pressures in various other markets. The improvement also reflects lower amortization expense for intangible assets and the impact of restructuring programs implemented in 2011 to realign various manufacturing operations. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,352 $ 4,989 $ 5,894 7 % (15 )% as a % of net sales 28 % 27 % 34 % 42 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2013 and 2012 included $228 million and $213 million, respectively, of costs associated with the separation of AbbVie from Abbott. SG&A expenses in 2013 included restructuring charges aggregating $39 million which principally related to the restructuring of certain commercial operations in conjunction with the loss and expected loss of exclusivity of certain products. SG&A expenses in 2012 and 2011 included litigation charges of $100 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to the Depakote investigation. Refer to Note 13 for information on the Depakote charge. Excluding these items from all years, SG&A expenses increased 9 percent and 7 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increases in SG&A expenses over the three-year period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products, including continued spending for HUMIRA, and in 2013, the full year incremental costs of becoming an independent company. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Research and development $ 2,855 $ 2,778 $ 2,618 3 % 6 % as a % of net sales 15 % 15 % 15 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 338 $ 288 $ 673 17 % (57 )% R&D expense in 2013 reflects added funding to support the company's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. R&D expense in 2013 and 2012 reflected continued pipeline spending on programs in biologics, neuroscience and virology as well as a $50 million R&D milestone payment related to a product in development for the treatment of CKD in 2012. R&D expenses also included restructuring charges of $15 million in 2013, $183 million in 2012 and $72 million in 2011. Excluding restructuring charges and milestone payments, R&D expenses increased 11 percent in 2013 and less than 1 percent in 2012. Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense in 2013 principally included a charge of $175 million as a result of entering into a global license agreement with Ablynx NV to develop and commercialize ALX-0061, a charge of $70 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop ALV003, a charge of $45 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Galapagos NV for cystic fibrosis therapies and charges totaling $48 million as a result of entering into several other arrangements. IPR&D expense in 2012 included a charge of $110 million for the acquisition of ABT-719, a charge of $150 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor, and a charge of $28 million as a result of entering into a two-year collaboration agreement to research, develop and commercialize up to three compounds with Antibody-Drug Conjugate approaches. IPR&D expense in 2011 included a charge of $188 million for the achievement of a developmental milestone under a licensing agreement for bardoxolone methyl, and charges of $400 million and $85 million for entering into collaboration agreements for second-generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an anti-CD4 biologic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense (income), net in 2013 was $278 million and was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income of $21 million. In November 2012, AbbVie issued $14.7 billion of long-term debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and 43 entered into interest rate swaps with various financial institutions, which converted $8.0 billion of its fixed rate interest rate debt to floating interest rate debt. In addition, AbbVie issued $1.0 billion of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2012. The balance of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013 was $400 million. Interest expense, net in 2012 of $84 million was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt and bridge facility fees related to the separation from Abbott, partially offset by interest income of $20 million. Other (Income) Expense Other (income) expense, net, included expenses of $11 million in 2013, $29 million in 2012 and $56 million in 2011 of fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration related to an acquisition of a business in 2010. Other (income) expense, net, for 2013, 2012 and 2011 also included ongoing contractual payments associated with the conclusion of a preexisting joint venture arrangement dissolved in 2008. Other (income) expense, net, in 2012 included income of $21 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement and a loss of $52 million for the impairment of an equity security. Income Tax Expense The income tax rates were 22.6 percent in 2013, 7.9 percent in 2012 and 6.4 percent in 2011. Income taxes in 2012 and 2011 included the recognition of tax benefits totaling approximately $195 million and $410 million, respectively, as a result of favorable resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2013 over 2012 is principally due to income tax expense related to certain 2013 earnings outside the United States that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested and the absence of the $195 million of tax benefits recorded in 2012 as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year. Income taxes in 2011 also reflected the non-deductibility of a litigation reserve. Transition from Abbott and Cost to Operate as an Independent Company AbbVie's historical financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect AbbVie's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of Abbott, rather than as an independent company. AbbVie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company, including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs, and incremental costs to operate a stand-alone back office infrastructure outside the United States. AbbVie's transition services agreements with Abbott in the United States cover certain corporate support services that AbbVie has historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, and other financial functions, as well as engineering support for various facilities, quality assurance support, and other administrative services. The terms of the services under the agreements vary by activity. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. As of the date of the separation, AbbVie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the United States. As a result, AbbVie entered into transition services agreements with Abbott to provide services outside the United States, including back office services in certain countries, for up to two years after separation. The back office services provided include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, and other administrative services. These transition services agreements have allowed AbbVie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to 44 establishing a stand-alone back office infrastructure for all countries. During the transition from Abbott, AbbVie has and will continue to incur non-recurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure. In addition, in certain international markets as of the date of the separation and as of December 31, 2013, certain marketing authorizations to sell AbbVie's products continued to be held by Abbott until such authorizations could be transferred through the applicable regulatory channels. It is not practicable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred in each of the periods presented in the historical financial statements for the functions described above. Actual costs that would have been incurred if AbbVie operated as a stand-alone company during these periods would have depended on various factors, including organizational design, outsourcing and other strategic decisions related to corporate functions, information technology, and international back office infrastructure. Refer to Note 1 for further description of transactions between AbbVie and Abbott. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Cash flows provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 6,267 $ 6,345 $ 6,247 Investing activities 879 (2,418 ) 553 Financing activities (3,442 ) 1,931 (6,783 ) Strong cash flows from operating activities were driven by net earnings and focused working capital management. In 2013, cash flows from operating activities also reflected cash paid for taxes of $1.3 billion, cash paid for interest of $283 million and a voluntary contribution to its main domestic defined benefit pension plan of $145 million. In 2012, cash flows from operating activities reflected cash paid for interest of $61 million and a voluntary contribution to its sponsored pension plans of $46 million. In 2011, AbbVie recorded non-cash charges of $1.5 billion in accrued liabilities to establish a litigation reserve related to claims on AbbVie's previous sales and marketing activities for Depakote. AbbVie made payments of $1.6 billion in 2012 to settle these claims. Cash flows from investing activities in 2013 and 2012 reflected capital expenditures, net sales (purchases) of short-term investments and payments related to certain collaboration, license and acquisition agreements. Refer to Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for information regarding significant collaboration, license and acquisition agreements. AbbVie issued senior notes of $14.7 billion in November 2012 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper in December 2012. Abbott's guarantee of the senior notes terminated upon the distribution of AbbVie common stock to the shareholders of Abbott upon the separation on January 1, 2013. The senior notes, which have maturities ranging from three to 30 years, may be redeemed at any time, except the floating rate notes and some of the senior notes of each series, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a make-whole premium. In 2013, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $400 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, at weighted-average interest rates of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, for each period. AbbVie may retire or issue additional commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Historically, cash flows from financing activities represented cash transactions with Abbott. The company's cash and equivalents and short-term investments increased from $8.0 billion at December 31, 2012 to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2013. During 2012, Abbott contributed approximately $4.4 billion of cash to newly formed AbbVie entities, and AbbVie distributed $13.2 billion in cash and debt securities to Abbott. Subsequent to the separation, effective January 1, 2013, AbbVie no longer participates in cash management and funding arrangements with Abbott. 45 While a significant portion of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2013 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, AbbVie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the United States, AbbVie would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. AbbVie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at December 31, 2013 has been reinvested indefinitely. A quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share was paid on common stock in 2013 resulting in total dividends paid of $2.56 billion for 2013. On December 12, 2013, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share for stockholders of record on January 15, 2014, payable on February 14, 2014. AbbVie expects to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend; however, the timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2013, the company announced a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately. Purchases of AbbVie common stock may be made from time to time at management's discretion. The plan has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. During 2013, AbbVie repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for $223 million in the open market. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with governmental health systems. Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in these countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. While the company continues to receive payments on these receivables, these conditions have resulted in an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at December 31 were as follows. Net receivables Net receivables over one year past due (in millions) 2013 2012 2013 2012 Greece $ 37 $ 52 $ — $ 13 Portugal 59 80 3 23 Italy 245 308 22 40 Spain 440 285 135 2 Total $ 781 $ 725 $ 160 $ 78 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ With the exception of Greece, AbbVie historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries. AbbVie continues to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against an accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. In addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries, AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. If government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance. 46 Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $2.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, entered into in July 2012, which also supports commercial paper borrowings. As of the date of separation, January 1, 2013, Abbott's obligations under this facility were relieved and AbbVie became the sole obligor. The credit facility enables the company to borrow funds at floating interest rates. At December 31, 2013, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the new credit facility are not material. There were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility on December 31, 2013. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings Credit ratings of Baa1 and A assigned to AbbVie in 2012 by Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's Corporate, respectively, have not changed as of December 31, 2013. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013. (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Short-term borrowings $ 413 $ 413 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 14,798 18 4,023 5,014 5,743 Interest on long-term debt(a) 4,882 281 633 621 3,347 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments 875 87 150 108 530 Purchase obligations and other(b) 26 26 — — — Other long-term liabilities(c) 1,258 390 182 306 380 Total $ 22,252 $ 1,215 $ 4,988 $ 6,049 $ 10,000 (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2013. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only 47 pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2013. Refer to Notes 8 and 9 for further discussion regarding the company's debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at December 31, 2013. Annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material. (b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c)Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $370 million AbbVie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2013. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring and an expected payment related to the contingent sales-based payment recognized as part of the acquisition of a business in 2013. Refer to Notes 7 and 9 for further information. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of which products have been sold subject to the rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply for that rebate, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the 48 rebate. Using historical trends for that rebate, adjusted for current changes, AbbVie estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when AbbVie records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale. AbbVie regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded in the same period as the related sales, and are reflected as a reduction of sales. Rebates and chargebacks in 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $4.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, or 30 percent, 28 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the gross sales subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by $160 million in 2013. AbbVie considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances for cash discounts and returns charged against gross sales were $748 million, $667 million and $617 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the United States, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare rebates, managed care rebates and wholesaler chargebacks. Medicaid rebates relate to the Federal Medicaid program, which is administered by state agencies, whereby rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities under various laws and regulations and in some cases supplemental rebates are also provided to the states under contractual agreements. Medicare rebates are negotiated with managed care organizations that manage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Pharmacy benefit manager rebates arise from contractual agreements with private health care plans that seek to reduce costs by negotiating discounts with pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Under wholesaler chargeback programs, the wholesaler charges AbbVie back for the difference between the price paid by the wholesaler to AbbVie and the price paid by the end customer to the wholesaler under contractual discount agreements negotiated between AbbVie and the end customer. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, for each type of rebate, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for that rebate. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product and by customer or payer and to estimate the contractual or statutory rebate or net price. AbbVie believes systems and calculations are reliable. 49 The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 88 percent of the combined rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2013. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 634 $ 410 $ 159 Provisions 985 831 1,361 Payments (899 ) (735 ) (1,349 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 720 506 171 Provisions 1,077 830 1,645 Payments (990 ) (840 ) (1,592 ) Balance at December 31, 2012 807 496 224 Provisions 1,028 846 2,362 Payments (1,168 ) (883 ) (2,374 ) Balance at December 31, 2013 $ 667 $ 459 $ 212 Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. AbbVie employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Cash Discounts and Returns Cash discounts can be reliably estimated. Product returns can be reliably estimated because AbbVie's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Pension and Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The discount rate is the single rate that equates the discounted cash flows to the rates utilizing the yield curve. As a result, the yield-curve approach reflects the specific cash flows for plans (i.e. duration) in calculating the discount rate. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and post-employment plans as of December 31, 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014. A 0.5% change in the assumed 50 discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2014 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2013: 50 basis point (in millions) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service cost and interest cost $ (37 ) $ 38 Projected benefit obligation (329 ) 358 Other post-employment plans Service cost and interest cost $ (3 ) $ 4 Projected benefit obligation (30 ) 34 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014. As of December 31, 2013, a 1% change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2014 by $28 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2013 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2014. A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2014 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013: One percentage point (in millions) Increase Decrease Service cost and interest cost $ 13 $ (9 ) Projected benefit obligation 71 (56 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 13 for further information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be 51 zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. There were no significant litigation reserves at December 31, 2013. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time, it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. For its impairment reviews, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization totaled $8.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets was $509 million, $625 million and $764 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2013, 2012 or 2011 and the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of AbbVie's single reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. In 2012 and 2011, AbbVie recorded impairment charges of $13 million and $46 million, respectively, for certain projects under development. These charges are included in R&D expenses. CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS Legislative Issues In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to herein as ""health care reform legislation"") were signed into law in the United States. Health care reform legislation included an increase in the basic Medicaid rebate rate from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and extended the rebate to drugs provided through Medicaid managed care organizations. Starting in 2011, additional rebates were incurred 52 related to the Medicare Part D coverage gap ""donut hole."" These Medicare and Medicaid rebate changes will continue to have a negative effect on AbbVie's gross profit margin in future years. In 2011, AbbVie began recording the annual fee imposed by health care reform legislation on companies that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. The amount of the annual fee, which totaled approximately $110 million in 2013 and $100 million in both 2012 and 2011, is based on the ratio of certain of AbbVie's sales as compared to the total such sales of all covered entities multiplied by a fixed dollar amount specified in the legislation by year. The fee is not tax deductible and is included in SG&A expenses. AbbVie's markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations. AbbVie expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, ""Business"" and Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" 53 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party, generally within twelve months. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, AbbVie held $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in notional amounts of such contracts. AbbVie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts, which are not designated as hedges, are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss (gain) and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, AbbVie held notional amounts of $5.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31. 2013 2012 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 4,650 1.359 $ (56 ) $ 3,649 1.315 $ (10 ) British pound 492 1.638 (3 ) 91 1.612 — Japanese yen 401 103.2 7 323 84.4 5 All other currencies 1,308 N/A (4 ) 1,199 N/A (5 ) Total $ 6,851 $ (56 ) $ 5,262 $ (10 ) The company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $692 million at December 31, 2013. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contacts. A 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require AbbVie to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. Effective February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3, which resulted in a loss of $11 million 54 in the first quarter of 2013 recorded in net foreign exchange loss (gain) on the consolidated statement of earnings for 2013. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate swaps are used to manage the company's exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. AbbVie does not use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities. At both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, AbbVie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $8.0 billion. The company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100-basis points would have decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately $411 million at December 31, 2013. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100-basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $848 million at December 31, 2013. A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price Sensitive Investments AbbVie holds available-for-sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions. The fair value of these investments was approximately $49 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would have had an immaterial decrease to their fair value at December 31, 2013. A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in share prices. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities AbbVie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $58 million and $72 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. 55",2023-12-30 16:57:24.563676
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2015,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) and results of operations as of and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie develops and markets advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie products are used to treat chronic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease; hepatitis C (HCV); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); endometriosis; thyroid disease; Parkinson's disease; complications associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cystic fibrosis; and other health conditions such as low testosterone. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines, including more than 30 compounds or indications in Phase 2 or Phase 3 development across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 26,000 employees and its products are sold in over 170 countries. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. Financial Results Since becoming an independent company, AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results and returns for shareholders while ensuring a strong sustainable growth business over the longer term. In 2014, AbbVie grew worldwide net sales by 6 percent to $20.0 billion, driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA and double-digit sales growth from other key products including Creon, Duodopa and Synthroid. Sales growth in 2014 continued to reflect the impact of the loss of exclusivity in the company's lipid franchise, which resulted in the loss of $748 million of revenue in 2014 over the prior year. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, July 2013 for Trilipix and September 2013 for Niaspan. The company's financial performance in 2014 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10, including after-tax transaction and financing-related costs totaling $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire plc (Shire), a $750 million after-tax charge related to a research and development collaboration agreement with Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) and a $173 million after-tax charge as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Infinity). Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding the termination of the company's proposed combination with Shire and Note 6 for further information regarding the company's collaborations with Calico and Infinity. AbbVie's financial performance in 2014 also reflected an improvement in gross margin primarily due to favorable product mix across the product portfolio and operational efficiencies, as well as increased funding in support of AbbVie's emerging mid-and late-stage pipeline assets and additional HUMIRA indications. 33 In 2014, the company generated cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion, net of the after-tax transaction and financing-related costs incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire. These strong cash flows enabled the company to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to shareholders of $2.7 billion and repurchase approximately 9 million shares for $550 million. In addition, the board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.49 per share of common stock payable in February 2015, as well as authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program that is expected to be executed over the next several years. In addition to these financial results, AbbVie continued to advance its pipeline during 2014, including securing regulatory approval in the United States for AbbVie's interferon-free HCV treatment, VIEKIRA PAK, as well as submitting its regulatory application in the European Union, which was subsequently approved in January 2015. AbbVie also continued to advance its previously submitted regulatory applications in the United States for Duopa, which were subsequently approved in January 2015, and completed several late-stage clinical trials, including ZINBRYTA (daclizumab) for the treatment of the relapsing/remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS) and registrational programs for an expanded use of HUMIRA for hidradenitis suppurativa. AbbVie also augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities including in-licensing duvelisib, a dual acting PI3 kinase inhibitor currently under investigation for use in a variety of hematological malignancies, from Infinity and entering into a novel collaboration with Calico to discover, develop, and commercialize new therapies for patients with age-related diseases. 2015 Strategic Objectives In 2015, AbbVie expects sales performance to be driven by continued strong growth from HUMIRA, the launch of VIEKIRA PAK, and sales growth in certain key products including Creon and Duodopa, partially offset by a decline in several products due to generic competition, including AndroGel 1% and the remainder of the lipid franchise. In addition, AbbVie expects to achieve operating margin improvements while continuing to invest in its pipeline in support of opportunities in oncology, HCV, and immunology, as well as continued investment in key products. AbbVie expects to grow operating cash flows in 2015, which will enable the company to continue to augment its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. AbbVie expects to continue to drive strong HUMIRA sales growth in several ways. AbbVie seeks to expand the HUMIRA patient base by applying for regulatory approval of new indications for HUMIRA, treating conditions such as uveitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. AbbVie will also seek to drive HUMIRA sales growth by expanding its market share and its presence in underserved markets. AbbVie plans to continue making investments in key emerging markets, including Brazil, China, and Russia. Another key driver of AbbVie's performance in 2015 will be VIEKIRA PAK, which is now approved in the United States, the European Union and a number of other countries around the world. AbbVie expects to support the successful launch of VIEKIRA in the United States by securing payor positions and patient access and focusing commercial efforts on penetration in AbbVie-exclusive and parity accounts. The company has launched VIEKIRAX in several European countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, and continues to work with various governments around the world to gain reimbursements approvals. AbbVie will continue its investment in products with historically stable sales levels, while making adjustments as necessary to increase the value of its product portfolio. AbbVie plans to achieve this objective in a variety of ways depending on product and circumstances by, for example, identifying supply chain efficiencies, pursuing additional indications, and optimizing residual value as products reach the end of exclusivity. AbbVie believes that its approach will allow the company to maintain a strong operating margin. 34 R&D efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases and women's health. AbbVie's scientists work to advance a pipeline of specialty molecules that demonstrate strong clinical performance for patients and economic value for patients and their healthcare systems. Current R&D projects are described in the ""Research and Development"" section below. Abbvie will also continue to augment its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity in 2015. Research and Development Research and innovation continues to be a key strategic priority for AbbVie. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline includes more than 40 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements. Of these programs, approximately 13 are in Phase 3 development or in registration. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs during 2015. R&D is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology, renal disease, neurological diseases, and women's health, among others. Immunology HUMIRA is approved to treat the following autoimmune diseases in the United States, Canada, and Mexico (collectively, North America), and in the European Union: Condition Principal Markets ​ ​ ​ Rheumatoid arthritis (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Psoriatic arthritis North America, European Union Ankylosing spondylitis North America, European Union Crohn's disease (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Plaque psoriasis (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Juvenile idiopathic arthritis North America, European Union Ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe) United States, European Union Axial spondyloarthropathy United States, European Union Pediatric Crohn's disease (severe) United States, European Union Pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis European Union AbbVie continues to dedicate R&D efforts to expanding indications for HUMIRA, including in the fields of gastroenterology, dermatology and ophthalmology. Phase 3 trials are ongoing in preparation for regulatory applications of HUMIRA for uveitis in the United States and the European Union. A regulatory application for hidradenitis suppurativa has been filed in the United States and the European Union. AbbVie also has a number of next-generation programs underway to address immune-mediated conditions, including the following: • AbbVie's studies of dual variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) technology, which represents an approach that can target multiple disease-causing antigens with a single biologic agent, continue to progress. This proprietary technology could lead to next-generation biologic treatments for complex conditions such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, where multiple pathways are involved in the disease. ABT-122, a DVD directed against IL-17 and TNF, is currently in Phase 2 investigation in RA, and ABT-981, a DVD targeting IL-1 alpha and beta, is being studied in osteoarthritis in an ongoing Phase 2 program. 35 • AbbVie is collaborating with Biotest AG on an anti-CD4 biologic known as tregalizumab. The compound is currently in Phase 2b clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. • Filgotinib (GLPG0634), a next-generation, oral Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, is being developed with Galapagos NV (Galapagos) in a collaboration entered into during the first quarter of 2012. Filgotinib is currently in Phase 2b development to treat rheumatoid arthritis and may be able to address other autoimmune diseases. In January 2014, a Phase 2 study to evaluate Filgotinib to treat Crohn's disease was initiated. • ABT-494, AbbVie's JAK-1 selective inhibitor, is currently in Phase 2b. • In September 2013, AbbVie entered into a global collaboration with Ablynx NV (Ablynx) to develop and commercialize the anti-IL-6R Nanobody, ALX-0061, to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. ALX-0061 is currently in Phase 2 development for rheumatoid arthritis. • In May 2013, AbbVie entered into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alvine) to develop ALV003, a novel oral treatment for patients with celiac disease. ALV003 is currently in Phase 2b development. Virology/Liver Disease On December 19, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AbbVie's VIEKIRA PAK, an all-oral interferon-free treatment, with or without ribavirin (RBV), for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis. On January 16, 2015, AbbVie announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorizations for its all-oral, short-course, interferon-free treatment VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets). The treatment has been approved with or without RBV for patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection, including those with compensated liver cirrhosis, HIV-1 co-infection, patients on opioid substitution therapy and liver transplant recipients. Additionally, VIEKIRAX has been approved for use with RBV in genotype 4 chronic HCV patients. AbbVie's HCV combination is also in Phase 3 development in Japan. AbbVie submitted its regulatory application in Japan in 2015. AbbVie is also currently conducting Phase 2 studies of its next-generation HCV program which includes ABT-493, a potent protease inhibitor, and ABT-530, AbbVie's new NS5A inhibitor. Oncology AbbVie is focused on the development of targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies. AbbVie's later-stage oncology pipeline includes the following: • Elotuzumab is an anti-SLAM7 antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma under a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Phase 3 development began in June 2011 for multiple myeloma. In 2014, AbbVie and BMS announced that the FDA granted elotuzumab Breakthrough Therapy Designation for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethoasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received one or more prior therapies. Two Phase 3 studies are ongoing with results expected in 2015. • Veliparib (ABT-888), a PARP-inhibitor, is in a Phase 3 study in BRCA-mutated breast cancer being treated with chemotherapy initiated in 2014. Veliparib is also in Phase 2 evaluation for the treatment of a variety of other solid tumors. In 2014, AbbVie announced the initiation of four separate Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of veliparib, in combination with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a separate study in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, as a neoadjuvant therapy, when added to carboplatin, prior to surgery in women with early-stage, triple 36 negative breast cancer and in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-(HER2) negative metastatic or locally-advanced breast cancer, containing BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene mutations, when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel. • Venetoclax (ABT-199), a next-generation Bcl-2 inhibitor, is in development for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In 2014, two Phase 3 studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were initiated in collaboration with AbbVie's development partner, Roche Holding AG. AbbVie also completed enrollment in a single arm study evaluating venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL harboring the 17p deletion mutation, a negative prognostic factor. AbbVie anticipates results from this study in 2015. Venetoclax is also being explored for use across a number of different hematologic cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. • Other molecular targets are being explored with Antibody-Drug Conjugate approaches linking anti-target antibodies with potent cytotoxic agents. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA granted orphan drug designation to AbbVie's investigational compound ABT-414, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody drug conjugate, which is being evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. • In 2014, AbbVie in-licensed duvelisib, a dual acting PI3 kinase inhibitor currently under investigation for use in a variety of hematological malignancies, from Infinity. Duvelisib is also under investigation for use in indolent non-Hodgkins lymphoma and for use in CLL. Renal Disease AbbVie's renal care pipeline includes atrasentan, for the prevention of progression of diabetic CKD. In 2013, a Phase 3 study was initiated to assess atrasentan, when added to standard of care, on progression of kidney disease in patients with stage 2 to 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes. This global registrational study is expected to be completed in 2018. Atrasentan will potentially be the first compound launched to treat diabetic nephropathy by specifically targeting albuminuria and slowing the progression of CKD. AbbVie was previously investigating ABT-719, for the treatment of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac and vascular surgeries. In 2014, AbbVie completed its Phase 2b study and, based on the results of that study, decided not to continue development of ABT-719. Neurological Diseases AbbVie has clinical studies underway on multiple compounds that target receptors in the brain that help regulate mood, memory, and other neurological functions and conditions, including the following: • AbbVie is collaborating with Biogen Idec to develop ZINBRYTA (daclizumab) for the treatment of the relapsing/remitting form of MS, which is the most common form, and affects nearly 85 percent of newly diagnosed MS patients. The Phase 3 study for ZINBRYTA (daclizumab), an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, was successfully completed in 2014. AbbVie is in the process of working with Biogen Idec to complete its global regulatory applications for ZINBRYTA (daclizumab) which are expected to be submitted in the first half of 2015. • On January 12, 2015, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Duopa, a levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Duopa is administered using a small, portable infusion pump that delivers levodopa and carbidopa directly into the small intestine for 16 continuous hours via a procedurally-placed tube. This product is sold under the name Duodopa outside the United States. 37 • In 2014, AbbVie completed two Phase 2b studies of ABT-126, an a7-NNR modulator, in both Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Based on the results of these studies, AbbVie does not plan to advance the molecule in either of these indications. Women's Health AbbVie is developing a novel oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, elagolix, under a collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain and uterine fibroids. A Phase 3 study in endometriosis began in mid-2012 and a second Phase 3 trial for endometriosis was initiated in 2013. Positive top-line efficacy results from the initial Phase 3 study were recently announced and additional safety and efficacy data is expected in 2015. A Phase 2a study for uterine fibroids was initiated in November 2011 and transitioned to Phase 2b in 2013. Other Given the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included R&D expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to AbbVie's total R&D expenses, as well as qualitative factors such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on AbbVie's overall market position. There were no delays in AbbVie's 2014 R&D activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon AbbVie's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, the nature and extent of cost-sharing arrangements, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Separation from Abbott Laboratories and Basis of Historical Presentation AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Prior to the separation, the historical financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Abbott's consolidated financial statements and accounting records as if the former research-based pharmaceutical business of Abbott had been part of AbbVie for all periods presented. Accordingly, AbbVie's financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2013 are presented on a combined basis and reflect AbbVie's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as its business was operated as part of Abbott prior to the separation, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The combined financial statements principally represent the historical results of operations and assets and liabilities of Abbott's former research-based pharmaceutical business. For periods prior to January 1, 2013, the historical combined financial statements also reflected an allocation of expenses related to certain Abbott corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources, finance, information technology and quality assurance. These expenses were allocated to AbbVie based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount, square footage, number of transactions or other measures. AbbVie considers the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had AbbVie operated as an independent, stand-alone, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. Accordingly, the historical financial information presented for periods prior to January 1, 2013 may not be indicative of the results of operations or financial position that would have been achieved if AbbVie had been an independent, stand-alone, publicly-traded company during the periods shown or of AbbVie's performance for periods subsequent to December 31, 2012. 38 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

AbbVie is pursuing several new indications to help further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. AndroGel sales decreased 10 percent in both 2014 and 2013 primarily due to a decline in the overall U.S. testosterone replacement market. The company expects this trend will continue. AndroGel sales for 2013 were impacted by rebates implemented during the second half of 2012, certain account losses in early 40 2013, and the moderation of market growth experienced in 2012. AndroGel 1% sales are expected to be impacted by generic competition in early 2015. Global sales of Kaletra declined in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the HIV marketplace. Sales for Synagis increased 9 percent in both 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increased product uptake in 2014 and 2013 compared to 2013 and 2012, respectively. Synthroid sales increased 14 percent and 13 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to strong brand loyalty and market leadership, and favorable pricing. Sales of Sevoflurane, which were relatively flat in 2014 and declined 4 percent in 2013, continued to be impacted by generic competition. Sales of Creon in 2014 and 2013 grew by 25 percent and 17 percent, respectively, primarily driven by market growth and higher market share. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. Sales for AbbVie's consolidated lipid franchise, which includes TriCor, Trilipix, Niaspan, Simcor and Advicor, declined 70 percent in 2014 and 50 percent in 2013 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the U.S. market. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, July 2013 for Trilipix, and September 2013 for Niaspan. Sales of Duodopa, AbbVie's therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease approved in Europe and other international markets, increased 25 percent in 2014 and 16 percent in 2013. Duopa's regulatory submission in the United States was approved by the FDA in January 2015. AbbVie launched its HCV regimen, VIEKIRA PAK, in the United States following FDA approval in mid-December. Sales of VIEKIRA PAK reflect the shipment of launch quantities into the market to support full commercial launch in January 2015. The European Commission granted marketing authorizations for AbbVie's HCV regimen, VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + Exviera (dasabuvir tablets), in January 2015. AbbVie expects its HCV regimen to be a significant contributor to sales growth in 2015. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gross margin $ 15,534 $ 14,209 $ 13,872 9 % 2 % as a % of net sales 78 % 76 % 75 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The gross margin for 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio, including HUMIRA, operational efficiencies, price increases, and lower amortization expense for intangible assets, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and, in 2014 and 2013, the loss of exclusivity for the lipid franchise. Gross margin in 2014 also includes royalty income of $81 million relating to prior periods as a result of the settlement of a licensing arrangement, partially offset by a $37 million impairment charge for an intangible asset. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Selling, general and administrative $ 7,724 $ 5,352 $ 4,989 44 % 7 % as a % of net sales 39 % 28 % 27 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 41 SG&A expenses in 2014 included transaction-related costs totaling $1.7 billion incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information regarding the termination of the company's proposed combination with Shire. Excluding the Shire break fee and transaction-related costs, the increase in SG&A expenses in 2014 and 2013 was due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new products, including preparations for the expected launch of VIEKIRA PAK, as well as spending relating to new indications and geographic expansion for HUMIRA. These increases were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates in 2014 and 2013. SG&A expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 include $422 million, $228 million and $213 million, respectively, of costs associated with the separation of AbbVie from Abbott. SG&A expenses in 2014 also included a $129 million charge due to additional expenses related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee. On July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final rules and regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual non-tax-deductible fee payable to the federal government under the Affordable Care Act based on an allocation of a company's market share for branded prescription drugs sold to certain government programs in the prior year. The final rules accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid, to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined. This change required AbbVie and other industry participants to recognize an additional year of expense in 2014. As a result, an additional expense of $129 million was recognized in 2014. The final rules and regulations did not change the amount or timing of annual fees to be paid. SG&A expenses in 2013 included restructuring charges aggregating $39 million, which principally related to the restructuring of certain commercial operations in conjunction with the loss and expected loss of exclusivity of certain products and, in 2012, included litigation charges of $100 million related to an investigation of the sales and marketing activities for Depakote which was resolved in May 2012. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Research and development $ 3,297 $ 2,855 $ 2,778 15 % 3 % as a % of net sales 17 % 15 % 15 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 352 $ 338 $ 288 4 % 17 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ R&D expense in 2014 and 2013 reflected funding to support the company's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. These increases were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2014 and 2013. R&D expense included regulatory milestone payments of $40 million in 2014 and $50 million in 2012 related to the company's collaboration. R&D expenses also included restructuring charges of $15 million in 2013 and $183 million in 2012. Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense in 2014 principally included a charge of $275 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Infinity to develop and commercialize duvelisib, a treatment for patients with cancer. Refer to Note 6, ""Acquisitions, Collaborations and Other Arrangements,"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" for additional information related to the company's collaborations and other arrangements. IPR&D expense in 2013 principally included a charge of $175 million as a result of entering into a global license agreement with Ablynx to develop and commercialize ALX-0061, a charge of $70 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Alvine to develop ALV003, a charge of $45 million as a result of 42 entering into a global collaboration with Galapagos for cystic fibrosis therapies, and charges totaling $48 million as a result of entering into several other arrangements. IPR&D expense in 2012 included a charge of $110 million for the acquisition of ABT-719, a charge of $150 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor, and a charge of $28 million as a result of entering into a two-year collaboration agreement to research, develop, and commercialize up to three compounds with Antibody-Drug Conjugate approaches. Other Expense Other expense in 2014 consisted of a $750 million charge related to an R&D collaboration agreement with Calico to discover, develop, and commercialize new therapies for patients with age-related diseases. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of $391 million in 2014, $278 million in 2013, and $84 million in 2012 was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt. In November 2012, AbbVie issued $14.7 billion of long-term debt with maturities ranging from three to 30 years and entered into interest rate swaps with various financial institutions, which converted $8.0 billion of its fixed rate interest rate debt to floating interest rate debt. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $416 million, $400 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Interest expense, net in 2014 also included $141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire and, in 2012, bridge facility fees related to the separation from Abbott. Other Income, Net Other income, net, includes income from the resolution of certain contractual agreements, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, and impairments of equity securities. Other income, net in 2014 primarily consisted of income of $34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 25 percent in 2014, 23 percent in 2013, and 8 percent in 2012. The effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including acquisitions and collaborations. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2014 was principally driven by state valuation allowances of $129 million and additional expenses of $129 million related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is non-deductible. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2013 over 2012 is principally due to income tax expense related to certain 2013 earnings outside the United States that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested, as well as the absence of $195 million of tax benefits recorded in 2012 as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to a prior year. Transition from Abbott and Cost to Operate as an Independent Company AbbVie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company, including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs, and incremental costs to operate a stand-alone back office infrastructure outside the United States. AbbVie's transition services agreements with Abbott in the United States cover certain corporate support services that AbbVie has historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, and other financial functions, as well as engineering support for various facilities, 43 quality assurance support, and other administrative services. The terms of the services under the agreements vary by activity. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing AbbVie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. As of the date of the separation, AbbVie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the United States. As a result, AbbVie entered into transition services agreements with Abbott to provide services outside the United States, including back office services in certain countries, for up to three years after separation. These back office services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury, and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, and other administrative services. These transition services agreements have allowed AbbVie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to establishing a stand-alone back office infrastructure for all countries. During the transition from Abbott, AbbVie has and will continue to incur non-recurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure. In addition, in certain international markets as of the date of the separation and as of December 31, 2014, certain marketing authorizations to sell AbbVie's products continued to be held by Abbott until such authorizations could be transferred through the applicable regulatory channels. It is not practicable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred in each of the periods presented in the historical financial statements for the functions described above. Actual costs that would have been incurred if AbbVie operated as a stand-alone company during these periods would have depended on various factors including organizational design, outsourcing, and other strategic decisions related to corporate functions, information technology, and international back office infrastructure. Refer to Note 1 entitled ""Background and Basis of Presentation"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further description of transactions between AbbVie and Abbott. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash flows provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 3,549 $ 6,267 $ 6,345 Investing activities (926 ) 879 (2,418 ) Financing activities (3,293 ) (3,442 ) 1,931 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash flows provided by operations in 2014 was $3.5 billion compared to $6.3 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to after-tax transaction and financing-related and other costs of $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Shire, including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions. The decrease was also due to the timing of U.S. wholesaler collections and an investment in inventory in preparation for the launch of AbbVie's interferon-free HCV combination in the United States starting in mid-December 2014 and in the European Union in January 2015. The decrease was also due to an increase in AbbVie's voluntary contribution to its main domestic defined benefit pension plan, which was $370 million in 2014 and $145 million in 2013. AbbVie also made a voluntary contribution of $150 million to this plan subsequent to December 31, 2014. In 2014, cash outflows related to collaborations, acquisitions, and other arrangements totaled $622 million, including $275 million paid to Infinity related to a global collaboration to develop duvelisib (IPI-145), and $250 million to fund a novel R&D collaboration with Calico. AbbVie accrued an additional $500 million payment to Calico in 2014 due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the R&D collaboration, which was subsequently paid in 2015. In 2013, cash outflows related to collaborations, acquisitions, and other arrangements totaled $405 million, including $175 million related to the global collaboration with Ablynx NV and $70 million related to a global collaboration with Alvine. Cash flows from investing activities 44 in 2014 also reflected capital expenditures, including the purchase of a small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Singapore, and net sales (purchases) of short-term investments. In 2014 and 2013, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $416 million and $400 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Cash dividend payments totaled $2.7 billion in 2014 and $2.6 billion in 2013. On October 20, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share for stockholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2015, payable on February 13, 2015. The timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. In February 2013, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion common stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately. In October 2014, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, which was effective immediately and superseded the prior authorization. Under these programs, the company repurchased approximately 9 million shares for $550 million in the open market in 2014 and approximately 4 million shares for $223 million in the open market in 2013. Purchases of AbbVie shares may be made from time to time at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie's remaining share repurchase authorization was $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2014. Cash and equivalents in 2014 was also impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $577 million principally due to the impact of the substantial weakening of the Euro in 2014 on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets, and the weakening of foreign currencies in combination with an increased concentration of cash denominated in foreign currencies accumulated in anticipation of the terminated proposed combination with Shire. While a significant portion of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2014 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, AbbVie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the United States, AbbVie would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. AbbVie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at December 31, 2014 has been reinvested indefinitely. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain are with governmental health systems. AbbVie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in Southern Europe, as heightened economic concerns still exist. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Net receivables Net receivables over one year past due (in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Greece $ 30 $ 37 $ — $ — Portugal 27 59 7 3 Italy 176 245 16 22 Spain 213 440 10 135 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 446 $ 781 $ 33 $ 160 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 45 AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in Southern Europe will have a material impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow, or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility Prior to October 2014, AbbVie was party to a $2.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which also supported commercial paper borrowings. The credit facility enabled the company to borrow funds at floating interest rates. In October 2014, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were not material. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings On July 18, 2014, following the announcement of the proposed combination with Shire, Moody's Investor Service affirmed its Baa1 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating and revised its ratings outlook to ""stable"" from ""positive"". In addition, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) placed its ""A"" corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating on AbbVie on CreditWatch with negative implications. On October 21, 2014, S&P affirmed AbbVie's ""A"" corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating and removed the negative credit watch. S&P affirmed its ""A-1"" commercial paper rating and did not place it on CreditWatch. There were no other changes in the company's credit ratings in 2014. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. 46 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014. (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Short-term borrowings $ 425 $ 425 $ — $ — $ — Research and development collaborations(a) 500 500 — — — Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 14,815 4,021 4,037 1,020 5,737 Interest on long-term debt(b) 4,604 303 685 517 3,099 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments 562 114 195 155 98 Purchase obligations and other(c) 863 818 38 5 2 Other long-term liabilities(d) 930 174 193 154 409 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 22,699 $ 6,355 $ 5,148 $ 1,851 $ 9,345 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities includes a $500 million accrual for a payment to Calico due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the R&D collaboration, which was paid in the first quarter of 2015. (b)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2014. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2014. Refer to Notes 9 and 10 for further discussion regarding the company's debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at December 31, 2014. Annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material. (c)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (d)Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million AbbVie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2014. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. Refer to Notes 8 and 11 for further information. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements. 47 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies, state agencies that administer the federal Medicaid program, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of which products have been sold subject to the rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply for that rebate, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate. Using historical trends for that rebate, adjusted for current changes, AbbVie estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when AbbVie records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale. AbbVie regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded in the same period as the related sales, and are reflected as a reduction of sales. Rebates and chargebacks in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $5.9 billion, $4.9 billion, and $4.3 billion, respectively, or 29 percent, 30 percent, and 28 percent, respectively, of the gross sales subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related annual gross sales would decrease net sales by $201 million in 2014. AbbVie considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances for cash discounts and returns charged against gross sales were $610 million, $748 million, and $667 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the United States, the most significant charges against gross sales are for Medicaid and Medicare rebates, managed care rebates, and wholesaler chargebacks. Medicaid rebates relate to the Federal Medicaid program, which is administered by state agencies, whereby rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities under various laws and regulations and in some cases supplemental rebates are also provided to the states under contractual agreements. Medicare rebates are negotiated with managed care organizations that manage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Pharmacy benefit manager rebates arise from contractual agreements with private health care plans that seek to reduce costs by negotiating discounts with pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Under wholesaler chargeback programs, the wholesaler charges AbbVie back for the difference between the price paid by the wholesaler to AbbVie and the price paid by the end customer to the wholesaler under contractual discount agreements negotiated between AbbVie and the end customer. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances, 48 for each type of rebate, management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for that rebate. External data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers. Management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, systems and calculations are used to track sales by product and by customer or payer and to estimate the contractual or statutory rebate or net price. AbbVie believes its systems and calculations are reliable. The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 82 percent of the total consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in 2014. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 720 $ 506 $ 171 Provisions 1,077 830 1,645 Payments (990 ) (840 ) (1,592 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2012 807 496 224 Provisions 1,028 846 2,362 Payments (1,168 ) (883 ) (2,374 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2013 667 459 212 Provisions 1,015 970 2,825 Payments (970 ) (953 ) (2,784 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2014 $ 712 $ 476 $ 253 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. AbbVie employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For Medicaid, Medicare, and other government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Cash Discounts and Returns Cash discounts can be reliably estimated. Product returns can be reliably estimated because AbbVie's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Pension and Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The discount rate is the single rate that equates the discounted cash flows to the rates utilizing the yield curve. As a result, the yield-curve 49 approach reflects the specific cash flows for plans (i.e. duration) in calculating the discount rate. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and post-employment plans as of December 31, 2014, and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2015 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2014: 50 basis point (in millions) Increase Decrease ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined benefit plans Service cost and interest cost $ (53 ) $ 59 Projected benefit obligation (466 ) 540 Other post-employment plans Service cost and interest cost $ (6 ) $ 7 Projected benefit obligation (50 ) 58 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance, and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2014 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015. As of December 31, 2014, a 1 percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2015 by $42 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2014 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2015. A 1 percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2015 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014: One percentage point (in millions) Increase Decrease ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Service cost and interest cost $ 21 $ (16 ) Projected benefit obligation 121 (92 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 50 Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims, that arise in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 14 for further information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. There were no significant litigation reserves at December 31, 2014. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values, and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time, it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization totaled $7.4 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets was $403 million, $509 million, and $625 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2014, 2013 or 51 2012. In 2014, AbbVie recorded an impairment charge of $37 million related to certain on-market product rights in Japan due to increased generic competition. The charge was included in cost of products sold. In 2012, AbbVie recorded impairment charges of $13 million for certain projects under development. These charges were included in R&D expense. There were no impairment charges recorded in 2013. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. The core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. AbbVie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 52 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows, and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. Refer to Note 10 entitled ""Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in AbbVie's consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party, generally not exceeding twelve months. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, AbbVie held $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in notional amounts of such contracts. AbbVie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts, which are not designated as hedges, are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, AbbVie held notional amounts of $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013. 2014 2013 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 6,342 1.263 $ 114 $ 4,650 1.359 $ (56 ) British pound 563 1.618 21 492 1.638 (3 ) Japanese yen 333 116.9 6 401 103.2 7 All other currencies 930 N/A 7 1,308 N/A (4 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 8,168 $ 148 $ 6,851 $ (56 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $790 million at December 31, 2014. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contacts. A 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. 53 The company estimates that a 10 percent depreciation of AbbVie's most significant foreign currency positions against the U.S. dollar would cause a foreign exchange loss on cash and short-term investments of $611 million at December 31, 2014. A 10 percent depreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in these currencies. The company's Venezuelan operations continue to report with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require AbbVie to obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan bolivars for U.S. dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. Effective February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3, which resulted in a loss of $11 million in 2013 that was recorded in net foreign exchange loss on the consolidated statement of earnings. In the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms to three rates of exchange. As of December 31, 2014, these were the CENCOEX rate of 6.3 (the official rate); the SICAD I rate at approximately 12; and the SICAD II rate at approximately 50. In February 2015, the Venezuelan government confirmed the official exchange rate of 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar will be used for settlement of food and medicine purchases. The company continues to use the official rate of 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar to report its Venezuela financial position, results of operations and cash flows, since the company believes that the nature of AbbVie's business operations qualify for the official rate as permitted by law. The company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether the use of the official rate of 6.3 will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. If circumstances change such that the company concludes it would be appropriate to use a different rate, or if a devaluation of the official rate occurs, it could result in a significant change to AbbVie's results of operations. At December 31, 2014, AbbVie had approximately $240 million of net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (converted at a rate of 6.3 VEF/USD) in its Venezuelan entity, which had net sales of $240 million in 2014. If AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar had been converted at a rate of 12 VEF/USD at December 31, 2014, it would have resulted in a devaluation loss of $114 million in 2014. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate swaps are used to manage the company's exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. AbbVie does not use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, AbbVie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $8.0 billion. The company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100-basis points would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately $348 million at December 31, 2014. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100-basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $758 million at December 31, 2014. A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price Sensitive Investments AbbVie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are traded on public stock exchanges. The fair value of these investments was approximately $82 million and $49 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would have had an immaterial decrease to their fair value at December 31, 2014. A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in share prices. 54 Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities AbbVie holds equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $63 million and $58 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. 55",2023-12-30 16:57:36.761708
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2016,"Item 7. In 2016, AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of gross and operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through productivity initiatives in supply chain, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses, and continued leverage from revenue growth. AbbVie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 50 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, virology/liver disease, and neurology along with targeted investments in renal disease, cystic fibrosis, and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs during 2016. ​ 34 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ Significant Clinical Programs Approved or Submitted AbbVie submitted for review or received approval for the following significant late-stage development programs: Immunology • The FDA granted HUMIRA orphan drug designation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a painful, chronic inflammatory skin disease. AbbVie's supplemental Biological License Application (BLA) in the United States and its marketing authorization in the EU were approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015, respectively. Approval for this indication represents the thirteenth indication for HUMIRA in major geographies around the world. • In April 2015 AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for HUMIRA for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescence from four years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. With the EC decision, HUMIRA is now approved for use in this indication in all member states of the EU. • AbbVie submitted regulatory applications in the United States and the EU for the use of HUMIRA in the treatment of uveitis. AbbVie expects to receive regulatory approval in 2016. Oncology • In July 2015, AbbVie announced that the EC granted marketing authorization for IMBRUVICA as the first treatment option specifically approved for treatment of adult patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a rare, slow growing blood cancer. Pharmacyclics received FDA approval for IMBRUVICA for patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in January 2015. The EC approval triggered a $20 million milestone payment from Janssen. • In September 2015, AbbVie announced that it submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for IMBRUVICA for treatment-naïve CLL patients. The sNDA is based on results from the Phase 3 RESONATE™-2 study, which evaluated efficacy and safety of IMBRUVICA versus traditional chemotherapy, chlorambucil, in treatment-naïve CLL patients aged 65 years or older. The application has received a priority review. • In November 2015, AbbVie submitted a sNDA to the FDA for labeling considerations based on safety and efficacy results from the Phase 3 HELIOS trial investigating the use of IMBRUVICA, bendamustine, and rituximab, versus placebo plus bendamustine and rituximab, in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. • In February 2016, the FDA granted IMBRUVICA orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. • AbbVie submitted regulatory applications in the United States and the EU for venetoclax (ABT-199), an inhibitor of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein developed in collaboration with Genentech and Roche Holding AG. Priority review status was granted by the FDA and validation provided by the EMA for these submissions. Venetoclax is also in Phase 3 development for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. In addition, venetoclax was granted three Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the FDA: (i) for the treatment of CLL in previously treated (relapsed/refractory) patients with the 17p deletion mutation; (ii) in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients with chromosome 17p deletion; and (iii) in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with untreated (treatment-naïve) acute ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 35 myeloid leukemia who are ineligible to receive standard induction therapy (high-dose chemotherapy). • Registration submissions were submitted to the FDA and the EC for Empliciti (elotuzumab), a Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM7)-directed immunostimulatory antibody developed in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) for first-line and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Subsequently, the EMA validated for review the marketing authorization application for Empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of MM as combination therapy in adult patients who have received one or more prior therapies. The application was granted accelerated assessment by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). In addition, the FDA approved Empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of MM as a combination therapy in patients who have received one to three prior therapies. This is the first FDA approval for an immune-stimulatory antibody for MM in this indication. Empliciti will be marketed by BMS. Virology/Liver Disease • On January 16, 2015, AbbVie announced that the EC granted marketing authorizations for its all-oral, short-course, interferon-free treatment VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets). The treatment was approved with or without ribavirin (RBV) for patients with GT1 chronic HCV infection, including those with compensated liver cirrhosis, HIV-1 co-infection, patients on opioid substitution therapy and liver transplant recipients. Additionally, VIEKIRAX/EXVIERA was approved for use with RBV in genotype 4 (GT4) chronic HCV patients. • AbbVie's regulatory application in Japan for the company's all-oral, RBV and interferon-free, 12-week, two direct-acting antiviral treatment of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r), dosed once daily, was approved in September 2015 for the treatment of patients with GT1 chronic HCV infection. • In July 2015, the FDA approved AbbVie's regulatory application for TECHNIVIE (OBV/PTV/r tablets) in combination with RBV for the treatment of adults with GT4 chronic HCV infection who do not have cirrhosis. TECHNIVIE is the first and only all-oral, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral treatment approved in the United States for adult patients with GT4 chronic HCV infection. • AbbVie submitted a regulatory application in the United States for a once-daily, fixed-dosed formulation of VIEKIRA PAK to treat GT1 HCV. The proposed dosing for the fixed-dose formulation is three oral tablets, taken once daily with a meal, with or without RBV. AbbVie anticipates regulatory action on the new formulation in 2016. • The FDA accepted AbbVie's sNDA and granted priority review for VIEKIRA PAK without RBV in patients with genotype 1b (GT1b) chronic HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). Neurology • On January 12, 2015, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Duopa (carbidopa and levodopa), an enteral suspension for the treatment of motor fluctuations for people with advanced Parkinson's disease. Duopa is administered using a small, portable infusion pump that delivers carbidopa and levodopa directly into the small intestine for 16 continuous hours via a procedurally-placed tube. This product is sold under the name Duodopa outside the United States. • AbbVie is collaborating with Biogen to develop ZINBRYTA (daclizumab), an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of the relapsing/remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). In February 2015, the registration submission for ZINBRYTA was made in the United States followed by the EU submission in March 2015. In March, AbbVie and Biogen announced that the EMA had validated the companies' marketing authorization application for ZINBRYTA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in the EU. Validation confirms that the submission is complete and signifies the initiation of the ​ 36 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ review process by the CHMP. In April 2015, AbbVie and Biogen announced that the FDA accepted for review the registration submission in the United States. Other Significant Developments Transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 to Phase 3 development, as well as other significant developments, included the following: Immunology • In January 2016, AbbVie announced the commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial program to study the use of AbbVie's once-daily formulation of ABT-494, its internally developed investigational selective Janus Kinase 1 (JAK-1) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A Phase 2 trial of ABT-494 for the treatment of Crohn's disease is also ongoing. • In 2015, AbbVie received a decision by the EC regarding compliance with its pediatric investigation plan for HUMIRA, which ensures that necessary data are obtained through studies in children. As a result of this positive decision, the company is seeking an extension from each EU member state where a supplementary protection certificate is held. Once approved, this will extend the HUMIRA composition of matter patent in the EU by six months from April 2018 to October 2018. Oncology • In July 2015, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 study for the use of Veliparib (ABT-888), a PARP-inhibitor, for the treatment of ovarian cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Veliparib is also in Phase 3 development for various forms of breast and lung cancer. • AbbVie recently initiated its first Phase 3 clinical trial for IMBRUVICA in solid tumors. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Virology/Liver Disease • In October 2015, in consultation with the FDA, the product inserts in the United States for VIEKIRA PAK and TECHNIVIE were updated from ""not recommended in Child-Pugh B patients"" to a contraindication in patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. Patients classified as Child-Pugh C remained contraindicated as they have been since approval. • In January 2016, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating the safety and efficacy of its next-generation, all-oral, once-daily, pan-genotypic, RBV-free investigational HCV regimen, which includes ABT-493, a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and ABT-530, an NS5A inhibitor. Other • AbbVie is developing a novel oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, Elagolix, under a collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences (Neurocrine) for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain and uterine fibroids. In January 2016, AbbVie announced the initiation of the first of two planned Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Elagolix in the treatment of patients with uterine fibroids. AbbVie will make a milestone payment of $15 million to Neurocrine upon enrollment of the first patient. Elagolix is in late-stage development for endometriosis. • In 2012, AbbVie entered into a collaboration with Galapagos NV (Galapagos) to develop filgotinib, an oral JAK1 inhibitor. In 2015, following a thorough review of available data, AbbVie announced that it will not exercise its right to in-license filgotinib from Galapagos. Pursuant to the terms of the global collaboration agreement with Galapagos, all rights to filgotinib reverted solely to Galapagos. ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 37 In 2015, AbbVie also augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities including in-licensing an anti-tau antibody (ABBV-8E12) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders from C2N, a privately held protein diagnostic and therapeutic discovery company. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information regarding the license agreement with C2N. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales increased 19 percent in both 2015 and 2014, primarily as a result of market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies, higher market share, approval of new indications, and favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA revenues increased 29 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2014, driven by prescription volume, favorable pricing, and market growth across all indications. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 9 percent in 2015 and 13 percent in 2014, driven primarily by growth across indications in certain geographies. AbbVie continues to pursue several new indications to help further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States as well as collaboration revenues related to AbbVie's 50 percent share of IMBRUVICA profit outside of the United States following the completion of the acquisition of Pharmacyclics on May 26, 2015. AbbVie expects IMBRUVICA will be a significant contributor to revenue growth in 2016. AbbVie launched its HCV regimen, VIEKIRA PAK, in the United States following FDA approval in mid-December 2014 and launched VIEKIRAX/EXVIERA in the EU in January 2015. In addition to growth in approved markets, international revenues continued to increase during 2015 as the product was approved in additional geographies. Net revenues of VIEKIRA PAK in 2014 reflect the shipment of launch quantities into the market to support full commercial launch in 2015. Net revenues for Creon increased 22 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2014, driven primarily by continued market growth and higher market share. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. Synagis is a seasonal product with the majority of sales occurring in the first and fourth quarters. Net revenues increased 1 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2014. Revenues in 2015 reflected changes in demand in certain markets, as well as an unfavorable comparison to 2014 driven by a less severe respiratory syncytial virus season. Global Lupron net revenues increased 9 percent in 2015 primarily due to increased demand and favorable pricing in the United States. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. Global Kaletra net revenues declined 10 percent in 2015 and 7 percent in 2014 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the HIV marketplace. AndroGel net revenues declined 26 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2014, primarily due to a continued decline in the overall U.S. testosterone replacement market and the entry of generic competition for the AndroGel 1% formulation in January 2015. The company expects the U.S. testosterone replacement market will continue to decline in 2016. Net revenues for Duodopa, AbbVie's therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease approved in Europe and other international markets, grew 23 percent in 2015. AbbVie's regulatory submission for Duopa in the United States was approved by the FDA in January 2015. AbbVie expects net revenues for Duopa in the United States will continue to gradually increase during 2016 as the product gains acceptance in the marketplace. Net revenues for AbbVie's consolidated lipid franchise, which included TriCor, Trilipix, Niaspan, Simcor and Advicor, declined 45 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the U.S. market. Generic competition began in November 2012 for TriCor, July 2013 for Trilipix, and September 2013 for Niaspan. AbbVie has voluntarily withdrawn Simcor and Advicor from the market and discontinued distribution as of December 31, 2015. ​ 40 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ All other net revenues declined 21 percent in 2015 primarily due to reduced demand driven by market and share declines and a reduction in price for several of AbbVie's mature on-market products. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gross margin $ 18,359 $ 15,534 $ 14,209 18 % 9 % as a percent of net revenues 80 % 78 % 76 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The gross margin for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio, including HUMIRA, operational efficiencies, and price increases, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity for the lipid franchise. Gross margin in 2015 also includes milestone revenue of $40 million from a collaboration partner related the company's oncology program. Gross margin in 2014 also includes royalty income of $81 million relating to prior periods as a result of the settlement of a licensing arrangement and lower amortization expense for intangible assets, partially offset by a $37 million impairment charge for an intangible asset. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Selling, general and administrative $ 6,387 $ 7,724 $ 5,352 (17 )% 44 % as a percent of net revenues 28 % 39 % 28 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the absence of transaction-related costs totaling $1.7 billion incurred in 2014 in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Shire, as further discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SG&A expenses in 2014 also included a $129 million charge related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee due to the issuance of final rules which resulted in an additional year of expense in 2014. Refer to Note 13 for further information. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses increased in both 2015 and 2014, reflecting increased selling and marketing support for new products, including the global launch of VIEKIRA, as well as spending relating to new indications and geographic expansion for HUMIRA and other growth brands. SG&A expenses in 2015 also included Pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $294 million, charges aggregating $165 million to increase the company's litigation reserves and restructuring charges of $39 million. These increased costs were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates in 2015. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Research and development $ 4,285 $ 3,297 $ 2,855 30 % 15 % as a percent of net revenues 19 % 17 % 15 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 150 $ 352 $ 338 (57 )% 4 % ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ R&D expenses for 2015 included Pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $152 million, a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party, a $130 million ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 41 charge recorded due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration with Infinity, the post-acquisition R&D expenses of Pharmacyclics, and restructuring charges of $32 million. R&D expenses in 2014 and 2013 included regulatory milestone payments of $40 million made to a collaboration partner for regulatory milestones related to the company's HCV program and restructuring charges of $15 million, respectively. R&D expenses in 2015 and 2014 otherwise reflected added funding to support the company's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. These increases were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014. IPR&D expenses in 2015 included a charge of $100 million as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. IPR&D expenses in 2014 included a charge of $275 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Infinity to develop and commercialize duvelisib, a treatment for patients with cancer. IPR&D expense in 2013 included a charge of $175 million as a result of entering into a global license agreement with Ablynx NV to develop and commercialize ALX-0061, a charge of $70 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop ALV003, a charge of $45 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Galapagos for cystic fibrosis therapies, and charges totaling $48 million as a result of entering into several other arrangements. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the company's collaborations and other arrangements. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses in 2014 included a $750 million charge related to an R&D collaboration agreement entered into in September 2014 with Calico to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies for patients with age-related diseases. Other Non-Operating Expenses Interest expense, net was $686 million in 2015, $391 million in 2014, and $278 million in 2013 and was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt. Interest expense, net in 2015 increased due to the May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and an accelerated share repurchase program. Interest expense, net in 2015 also included $86 million of bridge financing related fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. Interest expense, net in 2014 included $141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire. In 2014, AbbVie entered into certain undesignated forward contracts to hedge the then anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the then proposed combination with Shire. Net foreign exchange loss for 2014 included losses of $666 million associated with the Shire-related forward contracts. Net foreign exchange loss for 2015 included losses totaling $170 million to reflect the completed liquidation of the company's remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with Shire. Other non-operating expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, in 2014 primarily consisted of income of $34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 23 percent in 2015, 25 percent in 2014, and 23 percent in 2013. The effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including acquisitions and ​ 42 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ collaborations. The effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. The effective income tax rate in 2014 included state valuation allowances of $129 million and additional expenses of $129 million related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is non-deductible. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash flows provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 7,535 $ 3,549 $ 6,267 Investing activities $ (12,936 ) $ (926 ) $ 879 Financing activities $ 5,752 $ (3,293 ) $ (3,442 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash flows provided by operations in 2015 was $7.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved results of operations due to revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin as well as the absence of after-tax transaction and financing-related and other costs of $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Shire, including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions. Cash provided by operating activities also reflected AbbVie's voluntary contributions to its main domestic defined benefit plan of $150 million and $370 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. AbbVie also made a voluntary contribution of $150 million to this plan subsequent to December 31, 2015. AbbVie also paid $350 million to purchase a priority review voucher from United Therapeutics Corporation in 2015. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $61 million, $56 million, and $38 million, respectively, and were presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the financing section. Investing activities in 2015 primarily included the $11.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Pharmacyclics in May 2015, net of cash acquired of $877 million. Investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to Calico that was accrued in 2014 due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the R&D collaboration, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, and $130 million paid to Infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. In 2014, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $622 million, including $275 million paid to Infinity related to a global collaboration to develop duvelisib (IPI-145), and $250 million to fund a novel R&D collaboration with Calico. Cash flows from investing activities in 2015 and 2014 also reflected capital expenditures and net sales (purchases) of short-term investments. Capital expenditures in 2014 included the purchase of a small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Singapore. AbbVie incurred additional expenditures in 2015 to build a new biologics facility on the site to produce bulk drug substance for HUMIRA as well as to support AbbVie's biologic pipeline. In 2015 and 2014, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $400 million and $416 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with various maturities between 2018 and 2045. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program described below. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a three-year $2 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2 billion term loan credit facility. In November ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 43 2015, AbbVie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. During 2015 in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement as well as $93 million of costs relating to the issuance of senior notes. Cash dividend payments totaled $3.3 billion in 2015 and $2.7 billion in 2014. On October 30, 2015, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.57 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 16, 2016 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2016. The timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. In October 2014, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program. In March 2015, the board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase program in anticipation of executing an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. On May 26, 2015, AbbVie entered into and executed a $5.0 billion ASR with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (Morgan Stanley). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR, Morgan Stanley made an initial delivery of approximately 68 million shares of AbbVie's common stock on May 27, 2015, which represented approximately 90 percent of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR. Subsequently in 2015, Morgan Stanley delivered an additional 5 million shares of AbbVie's common stock to AbbVie in final settlement of the ASR. AbbVie recorded the aggregate $5.0 billion purchase price as a reduction to stockholders' equity. In addition to the ASR, the company repurchased approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in the open market in 2015 and approximately 9 million shares for $550 million in the open market in 2014. AbbVie settled $300 million of its 2015 open market purchases in 2016. Purchases of AbbVie shares under this program may be made from time to time at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. Cash and equivalents in 2015 and 2014 were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $300 million and $577 million, respectively, principally due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. In 2014, AbbVie had an increased concentration of cash denominated in foreign currencies accumulated in anticipation of the terminated proposed combination with Shire. While a significant portion of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2015 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, AbbVie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the United States, AbbVie would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. AbbVie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at December 31, 2015 has been reinvested indefinitely. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring ​ 44 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain are with governmental health systems. AbbVie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in Southern Europe, as heightened economic concerns still exist. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Net receivables Net receivables over one year past due (in millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Greece $ 53 $ 30 $ — $ — Portugal 27 27 3 7 Italy 211 176 4 16 Spain 234 213 — 10 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 525 $ 446 $ 7 $ 33 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries, which have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Outstanding net governmental receivables related to Saudi Arabia were $108 million as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Item 7A, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk"" for additional disclosures related to Venezuela. Due to the decline in the price of oil, liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses. Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in Southern Europe and oil-exporting countries will have a material impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, which matures in October 2019. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were not material. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 45 believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings On April 7, 2015, following the announcement of the then proposed combination with Pharmacyclics, Moody's Investor Service confirmed its Baa1 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating and revised its ratings outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable"". On March 5, 2015, Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) affirmed AbbVie's ""A"" corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating and its ""A-1"" commercial paper rating and revised its ratings outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable"". There were no additional changes in the company's credit ratings in 2015. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015: (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Short-term borrowings $ 406 $ 406 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 31,539 2,025 10,049 3,778 15,687 Interest on long-term debt(a) 12,423 866 1,810 1,574 8,173 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments 1,010 119 208 164 519 Purchase obligations and other(b) 1,423 1,293 86 24 20 Other long-term liabilities(c) 880 240 171 77 392 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 47,681 $ 4,949 $ 12,324 $ 5,617 $ 24,791 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2015. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2015. Refer to Notes 9 and 10 for further discussion regarding the company's debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at December 31, 2015. Annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material. (b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c)Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million AbbVie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2015. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. Refer to Notes 8 and 11 for further information. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting ​ 46 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $8.6 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 90 percent of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks charged against ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 47 revenues in 2015. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.

The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e., duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie will also reflect the plans' specific cash flows and apply them to the specific spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2015, and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. A 50 basis ​ 48 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined benefit plans Service cost and interest cost $ (45 ) $ 51 Projected benefit obligation $ (409 ) $ 461 Other post-employment plans Service cost and interest cost $ (5 ) $ 6 Projected benefit obligation $ (46 ) $ 52 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Effective December 31, 2015, AbbVie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the AbbVie Pension Plan and its primary other post-employment benefit plan in the United States as well as certain international defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefit plans. Based on current economic conditions, this change is expected to reduce AbbVie's net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016 as a result of this change. Refer to Note 11 for further information regarding this change. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance, and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. A 1 percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2016 by $45 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. A 1 percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015: One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Service cost and interest cost $ 20 $ (15 ) Projected benefit obligation $ 114 $ (90 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 49 Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 14 for further information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values, and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. ​ 50 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. The core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AbbVie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-4, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities. Accordingly, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. AbbVie is currently assessing the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the implementation approach to be used. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted on a retrospective basis. AbbVie elected to early adopt this new standard, effective in the three months ended June 30, 2015. As a result, AbbVie reclassified approximately $7 million and $27 million of net deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2014 that were previously classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, to long-term debt and lease obligations (current and non-current). Total debt issuance costs classified as a reduction of long-term debt and lease obligations (current and non-current) were $117 million as of December 31, 2015. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This standard requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Entities are currently required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. AbbVie elected to early adopt the standard, effective in the year ended December 31, 2015. The impact of this adoption was not material. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Entities are currently required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments, which require non-current presentation only (by jurisdiction), are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The guidance is to be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. AbbVie elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis, effective as of December 31, 2015 in order to simplify the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 51 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current US GAAP. Amendments are to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. This standard is effective for fiscal years starting after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard does not permit early adoption with the exception of certain targeted provisions. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. ​ 52 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​ ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows, and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. Refer to Note 10 entitled ""Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" for further information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in AbbVie's consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains or losses on these contracts are included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold to a third party, generally not exceeding twelve months. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, AbbVie held $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in notional amounts of such contracts. AbbVie enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. The contracts, which are not designated as hedges, are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, AbbVie held notional amounts of $6.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 5,880 1.103 $ 34 $ 6,342 1.263 $ 114 Japanese yen 853 120.9 (2 ) 333 116.9 6 British pound 163 1.496 1 563 1.618 21 All other currencies 1,387 N/A 8 930 N/A 7 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total $ 8,283 $ 41 $ 8,168 $ 148 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The company estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $822 million at December 31, 2015. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts, which would be offset by gains on the underlying hedged items. A 10 percent appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. ​ ​ ​ 2015 Form 10-K | 53 The functional currency of the company's Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange Venezuelan bolivars (VEF) for U.S. dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government. In the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms to three rates of exchange. As of December 31, 2015, these were the official rate of 6.3; the Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency (SICAD) rate of approximately 13.5; and the Foreign Exchange Marginal System (SIMADI) rate of approximately 200. In the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company used the official rate of 6.3 VEF per U.S. dollar, and reported $317 million of net monetary assets and $210 million of net revenues denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government announced that it plans to devalue the official rate of 6.3 to 10 VEF to U.S. dollars, and eliminate the SICAD rate of 13.5 VEF to U.S. dollars. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar will result in a charge to AbbVie's results of operations in the first quarter of 2016. If AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar had been converted at a rate of 10 VEF to U.S. dollars at December 31, 2015, the company would have reported a devaluation loss of $117 million in 2015. If AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar had been converted at the SIMADI rate of 200 at December 31, 2015, the company would have reported a devaluation loss of $307 million in 2015. The company cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the Venezuelan currency or whether the use of the official rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances, which could result in a significant charge to AbbVie's results of operations at that time. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate swaps are used to manage the company's exposure of changes in interest rates on the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, AbbVie had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $11.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. The company estimates that an increase in the interest rates of 100-basis points would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by approximately $464 million at December 31, 2015. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100-basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015. A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price Sensitive Investments AbbVie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are traded on public stock exchanges. The fair value of these investments was approximately $111 million and $82 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in value occurs. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value of these investments by $22 million at December 31, 2015. A 20 percent decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in share prices. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities AbbVie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $33 million and $63 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value, and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. In 2015, AbbVie recorded impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's investments in non-publicly traded equity securities. ​ 54 | 2015 Form 10-K ​ ​",2023-12-30 16:57:37.528012
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology, oncology and neurology, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products.2016 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. In 2016, AbbVie's worldwide net revenues grew by 12% to $25.6 billion, driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA, post-acquisition revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and revenue growth in other key products including Creon and Duodopa. These increases were partially offset by a decline in net revenues of Kaletra and VIEKIRA.The company's financial performance in 2016 included delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.63. 2016 results included the following after-tax costs: (i) $615 million related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) a $298 million currency devaluation loss related to Venezuela; (iii) $273 million related to the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) compounds; (iv) $228 million for changes in contingent consideration; (v) $200 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (vi) $187 million associated with a tax law change for regulations issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 that revised the treatment of foreign currency translation gains and losses for certain operations; and (vii) milestone payments of $80 million. Additionally, 2016 financial results reflected added funding to support AbbVie’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands. In 2016, the company generated cash flows from operations of $7.0 billion, which AbbVie utilized to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to stockholders of $3.7 billion and repurchase approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in the open market (excluding the shares repurchased under an accelerated repurchase agreement). In October 2016, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.64 per share of common stock payable in February 2017. This reflects an increase of approximately 12% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.57 per share of common stock.In April 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab (BI 655066), an anti-IL-23 monoclonal biologic antibody, from BI pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. In June 2016, AbbVie acquired Stemcentrx, a privately held biotechnology company. The transaction expands AbbVie’s oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer and in early-stage clinical development for other solid tumors. In connection with the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie’s board of directors authorized a $4.0 billion increase to 2016 Form 10-K | 28AbbVie’s existing share repurchase program. Promptly following the closing of the Stemcentrx transaction, AbbVie entered into and executed a $3.8 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with a third party financial institution to reacquire nearly all of the newly-issued equity. In May 2016, AbbVie issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $7.7 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company’s outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion was used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion was used to finance the ASR. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes and repaid the company’s outstanding 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the acquisition of Stemcentrx and BI compounds, Note 9 for additional information related to the senior Euro notes and Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. 2017 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues through continued strong performance from its existing portfolio of on-market products, including its flagship brands, HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA as well as growth from pipeline products; (ii) expanding operating margins; (iii) continued investment in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, virology and neurology as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) augmentation of its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity with a focus on identifying compelling programs that fit AbbVie's strategic criteria; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives as follows:•HUMIRA sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories, increasing market leadership and strong commercial execution.•IMBRUVICA revenue growth driven by increasing market share within its five currently approved indications.•The favorable impact of pipeline products approved in 2016 or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2017. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through productivity initiatives in supply chain, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses and continued leverage from revenue growth. AbbVie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.Research and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 50 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, virology and neurology along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologyHUMIRA•In May 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted approval for HUMIRA for the treatment of pediatric patients aged six years or older, with moderate to severely active Crohn’s disease. 29 | 2016 Form 10-K •In June 2016, HUMIRA received both U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA approval to treat adults with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. HUMIRA is now the first and only FDA-approved non-corticosteroid therapy available for adults with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. This approval marks the 10th approved indication for HUMIRA in the United States for immune-mediated disease and the 14th approved indication in all geographies. •In November 2016, AbbVie announced that that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for HUMIRA to treat adolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). If future approval is granted by the European Commission, HUMIRA will be the first and only treatment option for patients aged 12 and older with HS. HUMIRA was approved for adults with moderate to severe HS by the European Commission in July 2015.Risankizumab•In April 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab (BI 655066), an anti-IL-23 monoclonal biologic antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, from BI pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. AbbVie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis and asthma. In addition to risankizumab, AbbVie also gained rights to an anti-CD40 antibody, BI 655064, currently in Phase 1 development.•In November 2016, AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted risankizumab orphan drug designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. ABT-494•AbbVie continued to make progress with ABT-494, the company’s selective JAK-1 inhibitor currently in late-stage development for rheumatoid arthritis. In first quarter of 2016, AbbVie initiated three Phase 3 studies in the registrational program. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company started a fifth pivotal trial.Other•In July 2016, following an evaluation of data for the development of ABT-122, a dual-variable domain (DVD) immunoglobulin targeting TNF and IL-17 in Phase 2 trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, AbbVie determined that further development of ABT-122 will not be pursued. While the trial data demonstrated that the DVD platform worked well, with clear evidence of biologic activity, the decision was based on a lack a differentiation from other candidates in AbbVie’s development pipeline.•In October 2016, AbbVie opted not to exercise an option to license vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6R Nanobody, from Ablynx NV based on results of a Phase 2 study in rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie retains an option to license vobarilizumab based on results of an on-going Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus. OncologyIMBRUVICA•In March 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. The approval was based on data from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial, which evaluated efficacy and safety of IMBRUVICA versus traditional chemotherapy, chlorambucil, in treatment-naïve patients with CLL or small lymphocytic leukemia. This is the first FDA-approved chemotherapy-free treatment option for first-line CLL patients. In May 2016, AbbVie announced that the EMA approved IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with CLL. IMBRUVICA is now available to treat all lines of CLL in the European Union (EU). This is the fifth treatment indication in the EU for IMBRUVICA.•In May 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA Prescribing Information to include new data from two Phase 3 trials supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma. The label now includes overall survival results in previously-untreated CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial. The IMBRUVICA label has also been updated with safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 HELIOS trial assessing the use of IMBRUVICA in combination with bendamustine and rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab in relapsed/refractory patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Additionally, the FDA approved a new IMBRUVICA indication to include the treatment of patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma with or without the deletion of chromosome 17p. 2016 Form 10-K | 30•In June 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted IMBRUVICA breakthrough therapy designation for chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, a rare condition with limited treatment options. This is the fourth breakthrough therapy designation for IMBRUVICA.•In January 2017, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. MZL is a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This marks the seventh FDA approval and fifth disease indication for IMBRUVICA since the medication's initial approval in 2013. Venetoclax•In April 2016, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Venclexta (venetoclax) tablets for patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior therapy. Additionally, in January 2016, the FDA granted two additional breakthrough therapy designations for venetoclax: (i) in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients with chromosome 17p deletion; and (ii) in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with untreated (treatment-naïve) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible to receive standard induction therapy (high-dose chemotherapy). A Phase 3 clinical trial was recently initiated to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in treatment naïve elderly subjects with AML who are ineligible for standard induction therapy.•In July 2016, AbbVie announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are considered sensitive or naive to proteasome inhibitors and have received one to three prior lines of therapy. The combination of venetoclax, bortezomib and dexamethasone will be compared to treatment with bortezomib, dexamethasone and placebo. •In December 2016, AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted conditional marketing authorization for VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor; and for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. Conditional marketing authorization is granted to medicines that address an unmet medical need, where the benefit of its immediate availability to patients outweighs the risk of limited data availability and where comprehensive data will be provided. VENCLYXTO is a fist-in-class, oral, once-daily medicine that selectively inhibits the function of the BCL-2 protein. VENCLYXTO is being developed by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. It is jointly commercialized by the companies in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.Rova-T•In June 2016, AbbVie acquired Stemcentrx and its lead late-stage asset Rova-T currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Rova-T is a novel bio-marker-specific therapy that is derived from cancer stem cells and targets delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) that is expressed in more than 80% of SCLC patient tumors and is not present in healthy tissue. Registrational trials for third-line SCLC are expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016. AbbVie recently began enrollment of a Phase 1 eight-arm ""basket study"" in neuroendocrine tumors and a Phase 1/2 regimen selection study as a first-line treatment for SCLC. Beyond Rova-T, Stemcentrx has four novel compounds in clinical trials across several solid tumor indications and has additional pre-clinical compounds.•In July 2016, BMS and AbbVie announced a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Rova-T in combination with BMS’ Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo + Yervoy (ipilimumab) regimen as a treatment for relapsed extensive stage SCLC. The Phase 1/2 clinical program will explore the potential of combining BMS’ immune-oncology agents in conjunction with Rova-T to drive improved and sustained efficacy and tolerability above the current standard of care. Other•In May 2016, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and AbbVie announced that the EMA approved Empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of multiple myeloma as combination therapy with Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Empliciti is now the first and only immunostimulatory antibody approved for multiple myeloma in the EU.31 | 2016 Form 10-K •In June 2016, AbbVie exercised its right to end its global collaboration with Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Infinity), which it entered into in September 2014 to develop and commercialize duvelisib (IPI-145) for the treatment of patients with cancer. Pursuant to the terms of the global collaboration agreement, the worldwide rights to duvelisib reverted to Infinity.Virology/Liver Disease•In February 2016, AbbVie announced that CHMP granted a positive opinion for the use of VIEKIRA (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets) without ribavirin (RBV) in chronic HCV infected genotype 1b (GT1b) patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). In April 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) without RBV in patients with GT1b chronic HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis. In July 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for VIEKIRA XR (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) extended-release tablets. VIEKIRA XR is a once-daily, extended-release co-formulation of the active ingredients in VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) and is for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 (GT1) HCV, including those with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A).•In October 2016, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for the investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir (ABT-493)/pibrentasvir (ABT-530) for the treatment of patients with HCV who failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals in genotype 1, including therapy with an NS5A inhibitor and/or protease inhibitor. •In January 2017, AbbVie announced that its marketing authorization application (MAA) has been validated and is now under accelerated assessment by the EMA for the company's investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of G/P for the treatment of all major chronic HCV genotypes. G/P is also intended to address the needs of patients with specific treatment challenges, including those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those not cured with previous direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. In February 2017, AbbVie announced that the FDA accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) and granted priority review for the company's investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of G/P for the treatment of all major chronic HCV genotypes.Neurology•In May 2016, Biogen and AbbVie announced that the FDA approved ZINBRYTA (daclizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). ZINBRYTA is a once-monthly, self-administered, subcutaneous injection. Biogen and AbbVie will co-promote ZINBRYTA in the United States. In July 2016, Biogen and AbbVie announced that the EMA granted a marketing authorization for ZINBRYTA for the treatment of adult patients with RMS. ZINBRYTA launched in the third quarter of 2016.Other•In January 2016, AbbVie announced the initiation of the first of two planned Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Elagolix in the treatment of patients with uterine fibroids. AbbVie made a milestone payment of $15 million to Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., AbbVie’s collaboration partner, upon enrollment of the first patient. Elagolix is also in Phase 3 development for endometriosis. 2016 Form 10-K | 32RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet RevenuesThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The sales increase in 2016 was driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies, favorable pricing in certain geographies and approval of new indications. The sales increase in 2015 was primarily as a result of market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies, higher market share, approval of new indications and favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA revenues increased 24% in 2016 and 29% in 2015, driven by prescription volume, favorable pricing, market growth across all indications and higher market share. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 4% in 2016 and 9% in 2015, driven primarily by growth across indications. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies to help further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA.Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA commenced following the completion of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, 2015. Global IMBRUVICA sales increased more than 100% in 2016 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as having a full year of sales in 2016. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased 6% in 2016, as a result of lower market share, primarily in the United States, market contraction and price erosion. In the United States, sales decreased 57% in 2016, primarily due to lower market share resulting from a new market entrant in the first quarter of 2016 and contraction of the overall market. International revenues in 2016 reflected sales in additional geographies where the product was approved subsequent to December 31, 2015. VIEKIRA was launched in 2015, revenues increased during 2015 as the product was approved in additional geographies. Synagis is a seasonal product with the majority of sales occurring in the first and fourth quarters. Net revenues remained constant in 2016 and increased 1% in 2015. Net revenues for Creon increased 15% in 2016 and 22% in 2015, driven primarily by continued market growth and higher market share. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.Global Kaletra net revenues decreased 17% in 2016 and 10% in 2015, primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the HIV marketplace. AbbVie expects net revenues for Kaletra to continue to decline in 2017. Net revenues for Duodopa increased 28% in 2016 and 23% in 2015, primarily as a result of market penetration and geographic expansion. Duopa was approved in the United States in January 2015. AbbVie expects net revenues for Duopa in the United States will continue to gradually increase during 2017 as the product gains acceptance in the marketplace.Gross Margin Percent changeyears ended December 31 (in millions)20162015201420162015Gross margin$19,805 $18,359 $15,534 8% 18%as a percent of net revenues77% 80% 78% Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2016 due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, higher intangible asset amortization and the unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit sharing arrangement and the amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory. These reductions were partially offset by the favorable impact of product mix across the portfolio and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, 2016 included a $39 million charge related to the impairment of an intangible asset in the first quarter of 2016. The gross margin for 2015 and 2014 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio, including HUMIRA, operational efficiencies and price increases, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity for the lipid franchise. Gross margin in 2015 also included milestone revenue of $40 million from a collaboration partner related the company's oncology program. Additionally, gross margin in 2014 included royalty income of $81 million relating to prior periods as a result of the settlement of a licensing arrangement and lower amortization expense for intangible assets, partially offset by a $37 million impairment charge for an intangible asset.35 | 2016 Form 10-K Selling, General and Administrative Percentchangeyears ended December 31 (in millions)20162015201420162015Selling, general and administrative$5,855 $6,387 $7,724 (8)% (17)%as a percent of net revenues23% 28% 39% SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2016 due to continued leverage from revenue growth and lower costs in 2016. 2015 SG&A expenses included costs associated with the separation from Abbott of $265 million, Pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $294 million and litigation charges of $165 million. Additionally, SG&A expense in 2015 reflected marketing support for the global launch of VIEKIRA. SG&A expenses declined in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the absence of transaction-related costs totaling $1.7 billion incurred in 2014 in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Shire, partially offset by the 2015 items discussed above. SG&A expenses in 2014 also included a $129 million charge related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee due to the issuance of final rules which resulted in an additional year of expense in 2014.

These increases were partially offset by the following factors: (i) 2015 R&D expenses included a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party; (ii) development milestones decreased in 2016 to $80 million compared to $133 million in 2015; and (iii) 2015 results included restructuring charges of $32 million. Acquisition costs decreased in 2016 to $140 million compared to $152 million in 2015. In addition to the 2015 factors discussed above, R&D expense in 2014 included regulatory milestone payments of $40 million made to a collaboration partner for regulatory milestones related to the company's HCV program.Acquired IPR&D expense in 2016 included charges of $200 million as a result of entering into various collaboration agreements. R&D expense in 2015 included a charge of $100 million as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2014 included a charge of $275 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with Infinity to develop and commercialize duvelisib, a treatment for patients with cancer. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the C2N and Infinity agreements.Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses in 2014 included a $750 million charge related to an R&D collaboration agreement entered into in September 2014 with Calico to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies for patients with age-related diseases. 2016 Form 10-K | 36Other Non-Operating Expenses Years Ended December 31,(in millions) 2016 2015 2014Interest expense $1,047 $719 $429Interest income (82) (33) (38)Interest expense, net $965 $686$391 Net foreign exchange loss $303 $193 $678Other expense (income), net 232 13 (27)Interest expense in 2016 increased due to the May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. Additionally, interest expense in 2016 included a debt extinguishment charge of $39 million related to the 1.75% senior notes redemption. These increases were partially offset by the absence of bridge financing-related costs of $86 million in 2015 incurred in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. Interest income in 2016 increased due to growth in the company’s investment securities. Interest expense, net in 2015 increased due to the May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Interest expense, net in 2014 included $141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with Shire. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVie’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation. Net foreign exchange loss in 2015 included losses of $170 million to complete the liquidation of the company’s remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with Shire. In 2014, AbbVie entered into certain undesignated forward contracts to hedge the then anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the then proposed combination with Shire. Net foreign exchange loss in 2014 included losses of $666 million associated with the Shire-related forward contracts.Other expense, net in 2016 included a charge of $228 million related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates and other market-based factors. In 2016, the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities. Other expense, net in 2014 primarily consisted of income of $34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 24% in 2016, 23% in 2015 and 25% in 2014. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax exemptions and incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and the cost of repatriation decisions. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as certain discrete factors and events, including acquisitions and collaborations. The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. The effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. The effective income tax rate in 2014 included state valuation allowances of $129 million and additional expenses of $129 million related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is non-deductible.37 | 2016 Form 10-K FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)2016 2015 2014Cash flows provided by/(used in): Operating activities$7,041 $7,535 $3,549Investing activities(6,074) (12,936) (926)Financing activities(3,928) 5,752 (3,293)Cash flows provided by operations in 2016 was $7.0 billion compared to $7.5 billion in 2015. Operating cash flows in 2016 reflected improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin, offset by income tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities also reflected AbbVie's voluntary contributions, primarily to its domestic defined benefit plans of $150 million in 2016, $150 million in 2015 and $370 million in 2014. AbbVie also made a voluntary contribution of $150 million to this plan subsequent to December 31, 2016. AbbVie paid $350 million to purchase a priority review voucher from a third party in 2015. Cash flows provided by operations in 2015 was $7.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2014. The increase was primarily due to improved results of operations due to revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin as well as the absence of after-tax transaction and financing-related and other costs of $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Shire, including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $55 million in 2016, $61 million in 2015 and $56 million in 2014 and were presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the financing section.Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016 and net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion. Investing activities in 2015 primarily included the $11.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Pharmacyclics in May 2015 (net of cash acquired of $877 million). Investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to Calico, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders and $130 million paid to Infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. Investing activities in 2014 included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaling $622 million, including $275 million paid to Infinity and $250 million paid to Calico. Cash flows from investing activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 also reflected capital expenditures. AbbVie incurred additional expenditures in 2014 to purchase a manufacturing facility and in 2015 to build a new biologics facility on that site. In 2016 and 2015, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $377 million as of December 31, 2016 and $400 million as of December 31, 2015. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes due to mature in November 2017. In connection with the offering, AbbVie incurred $17 million of issuance costs. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ASR transactions. In connection with the May 2016 issuance of senior notes, AbbVie incurred $52 million of issuance costs.In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. In 2015 the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18.0 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) as well as $93 million of costs relating to the May 2015 issuance of senior notes. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a three-year $2.0 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2.0 billion term loan credit facility. In November 2015, AbbVie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. Cash dividend payments totaled $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate. On October 28, 2016, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share beginning with the 2016 Form 10-K | 38dividend payable on February 15, 2017 to stockholders of record as of January 13, 2017. This reflects an increase of approximately 12% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.In addition to the ASRs, the company repurchased approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in the open market in 2016 and approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in the open market in 2015. Purchases of AbbVie shares under this program may be made from time to time at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $36 million as of December 31, 2016. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the ASR. On February 16, 2017, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to AbbVie's existing stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase authorization permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, has no time limit and may be discontinued at any time.Cash and equivalents were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 and $300 million in 2015. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. While a significant portion of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2016 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, AbbVie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. If these funds were needed for operations in the United States, AbbVie would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds. AbbVie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at December 31, 2016 has been reinvested indefinitely.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, that have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with government health systems. Outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries totaled $244 million as of December 31, 2016 and $525 million at December 31, 2015. The company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries, which have recently experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. Outstanding net governmental receivables were $122 million related to Saudi Arabia and $110 million related to Russia as of December 31, 2016. Due to oil market conditions in recent years, liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses.Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in oil-exporting countries will have a significant impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016.39 | 2016 Form 10-K Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityAbbVie currently has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, which matures in October 2019. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsOn April 28, 2016, following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Stemcentrx, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) lowered AbbVie’s corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating to “A-” from “A”. AbbVie’s “A-1” short-term rating remained unchanged. S&P revised its ratings outlook to “stable” from “negative”. On June 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded AbbVie’s senior unsecured long-term rating to Baa2 from Baa1 and affirmed AbbVie’s Prime-2 short-term rating. There were no additional changes in the company’s credit ratings in 2016.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:(in millions)Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsShort-term borrowings$377 $377 $— $— $—Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion37,077 25 7,503 5,562 23,987Interest on long-term debt(a)16,924 1,067 2,389 2,295 11,173Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments974 131 222 172 449Purchase obligations and other(b)1,818 1,669 118 20 11Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) (e)5,159 540 437 837 3,345Total$62,329 $3,809 $10,669 $8,886 $38,965(a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2016. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2016. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate agreements outstanding at December 31, 2016. (b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. 2016 Form 10-K | 40(c)Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million AbbVie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2016. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension plan. (d)Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.(e)Includes $4.2 billion of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.RebatesAbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $10.8 billion in 2016, $8.6 billion in 2015 and $5.9 billion in 2014. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and 41 | 2016 Form 10-K records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 90% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2016. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates WholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2013$667 $459 $212Provisions1,015 970 2,825Payments(970) (953) (2,784)Balance at December 31, 2014712 476 253Provisions1,716 2,215 3,866Payments(1,396) (1,771) (3,756)Balance at December 31, 20151,032 920 363Provisions2,606 3,146 3,987Payments(2,471) (2,899) (3,967)Balance at December 31, 2016$1,167 $1,167 $383Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsAllowances for cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $964 million in 2016, $898 million in 2015 and $610 million in 2014, are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 2016 Form 10-K | 42The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2016. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2016: 50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseDefined benefit plans Service and interest cost$(50) $54Projected benefit obligation(452) 511Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost$(6) $7Projected benefit obligation(51) 58Effective December 31, 2015, AbbVie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, AbbVie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. In late 2015, AbbVie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. AbbVie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. AbbVie has accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. This change reduced AbbVie’s net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016. This change had no effect on the 2015 expense and will not affect the measurement of AbbVie’s total benefit obligations. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2016 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2017 by $49 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2016 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016: One percentage point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseService and interest cost$21 $(17)Projected benefit obligation120 (95)Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement 43 | 2016 Form 10-K carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test.For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2016, a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount 2016 Form 10-K | 44rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $180 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $360 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015(in millions)Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/ (payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro$5,544 1.078 $102 $5,880 1.103 $34Japanese yen935 111.6 39 853 120.9 (2)British pound611 1.303 35 163 1.496 1All other currencies1,693 n/a 11 1,387 n/a 8Total$8,783 $187 $8,283 $41The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $854 million at December 31, 2016. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts, which would be offset by gains on the underlying hedged items. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange.In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. The functional currency of the company’s Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. At December 31, 2015, there were three legal exchange mechanisms administered by the Venezuelan government. These were the official rate of 6.3 Venezuelan bolivars (VEF) per U.S. dollar, the Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency (SICAD) rate of approximately 13.5 VEF per U.S. dollar and the Foreign Exchange Marginal System (SIMADI) rate of approximately 200. Effective March 10, 2016, the Venezuelan government devalued the official rate of 6.3 to 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, eliminated the SICAD rate and replaced SIMADI with a new exchange mechanism, Divisa Complementaria (DICOM). As of December 31, 2016, the DICOM rate was approximately 673 VEF per U.S. dollar. 45 | 2016 Form 10-K During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the DICOM rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2016, AbbVie’s net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $649 million at December 31, 2016. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.3 billion at December 31, 2016. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price RiskAbbVie’s debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $33 million as of December 31, 2016. If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the income statement in the period sold. AbbVie also holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are traded on public stock exchanges. A hypothetical 20% decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease the fair value of these investments by $15 million as of December 31, 2016. A 20% decrease is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in share prices. Non-Publicly Traded Equity SecuritiesAbbVie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $42 million as of December 31, 2016 and $33 million as of December 31, 2015. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. In 2016, impairment charges recorded were insignificant. In 2015, AbbVie recorded impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's investments in non-publicly traded equity securities. 2016 Form 10-K | 46",2023-12-30 16:57:37.282458
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neurology, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 29,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products.2017 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2017 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $28.2 billion, operating earnings of $9.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.30. Worldwide net revenues grew by 10% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the continued strength of HUMIRA, revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and other key products including Creon and Duodopa and the launch of HCV product MAVYRET. These increases were partially offset by a decline in net revenues of HCV product VIEKIRA.Diluted earnings per share in 2017 was $3.30 and included net charges related to the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The net charges included $4.5 billion for the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by after-tax benefits of $3.3 billion due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and other related impacts.Additional after-tax costs that impacted 2017 diluted earnings per share included the following: (i) $809 million related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $625 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $327 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (iv) litigation reserve charges of $286 million; (v) an intangible asset impairment charge of $244 million; (vi) milestone payments of $143 million; and (vii) acquisition related costs of $49 million. These costs were partially offset by an after-tax benefit of $91 million due to a tax audit settlement. 2017 financial results also reflected continued added funding to support AbbVie’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands. In 2017, the company generated cash flows from operations of $10.0 billion, which AbbVie utilized to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to stockholders of $4.1 billion and repurchase approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in the open market. In October 2017, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per share of common stock payable in February 2018. This reflected an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of common stock.28 | 2017 Form 10-K 2018 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (ii) continued investment and expansion in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neurology as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•HUMIRA sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories, maintaining market leadership and effectively managing biosimilar erosion.•IMBRUVICA revenue growth driven by increasing market share with its eight currently approved indications in six different disease areas.•The strong execution of new product launches, including MAVYRET.•The favorable impact of pipeline products approved in 2017 or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2018. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.Research and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neurology along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologyUpadacitinib•In June 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-NEXT clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib (ABT-494), the company’s selective JAK1 inhibitor currently in late-stage development for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond to treatment with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 trials and no new safety signals were detected.•In September 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-BEYOND clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond or were intolerant to treatment with biologic DMARDs. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 2 trials and the Phase 3 SELECT-NEXT clinical trial, with no new safety signals detected. 2017 Form 10-K | 29•In December 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-MONOTHERAPY clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe RA who did not adequately respond to treatment with methotrexate. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported Phase 3 SELECT clinical trials and Phase 2 trials, with no new safety signals detected.•In 2017, AbbVie initiated Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease and in subjects with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis.•In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for upadacitinib in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Risankizumab•In October 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, with 12-week dosing compared to ustekinumab and adalimumab met all co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the three studies.•In December 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 IMMhance clinical trial evaluating risankizumab at 16 weeks and 52 weeks of treatment compared to placebo met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported Phase 3 studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the Phase 3 program.•In December 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. OncologyIMBRUVICA•In January 2017, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. MZL is a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. •In August 2017, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. IMBRUVICA is the first therapy specifically approved for adults with cGVHD, a severe and potentially life-threatening consequence of stem cell or bone marrow transplant. This marked the sixth U.S. disease indication for IMBRUVICA since the medication's initial approval in 2013 and the first approved indication outside of cancer.•In December 2017, AbbVie announced that the Phase 3 iNNOVATE clinical trial evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab in patients with untreated (treatment-naïve) and previously-treated Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) met its primary endpoint. This is the first and only treatment approved for newly or previously-treated patients with WM.VENCLEXTA•In February 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in treatment-naïve elderly subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for standard induction therapy (high-dose chemotherapy). 30 | 2017 Form 10-K •In May 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) improves overall survival (OS) versus LDAC and placebo, in treatment naïve subjects with AML.•In September 2017, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 MURANO clinical trial evaluating venetoclax tablets in combination with Rituxan (rituximab) met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with bendamustine in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).•In December 2017, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and in January 2018, AbbVie submitted an sNDA for VENCLEXTA monotherapy in patients with CLL who have relapsed or are refractory to B-cell receptor inhibitors.Rova-T•In February 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum based chemotherapy in participants with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).•In April 2017, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate Rova-T compared with topotecan for subjects with advanced or metastatic SCLC with high levels of delta-like protein 3 who have first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy.ABT-414•In November 2017, AbbVie presented results from the INTELLANCE-2 trial, a potential registration-enabling Phase 2 study evaluating depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414), an investigational, antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alone or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Results from the INTELLANCE-2 study failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival and AbbVie will not be submitting regulatory applications for ABT-414 in recurrent GBM. In INTELLANCE-2, the combination of ABT-414 and TMZ performed numerically better than lomustine or TMZ and a positive trend in overall survival was observed. While AbbVie will not file in recurrent GBM based on these data, the Phase 2/3 INTELLANCE-1 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ABT-414 in combination with TMZ in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM with EGFR amplification is ongoing.Veliparib•In April 2017, AbbVie announced that two Phase 3 studies evaluating veliparib, an investigational, oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy did not meet their primary endpoints. The studies evaluated veliparib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Ongoing Phase 3 studies include non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, BRCA1/2 breast cancer and ovarian cancer.Virology/Liver Disease•In February 2017, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted a positive opinion for a shorter, eight-week treatment of VIEKIRAX (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + EXVIERA (dasabuvir tablets) as an option for previously untreated adult patients with genotype 1b chronic HCV and minimal to moderate fibrosis.•In July 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), a once-daily, ribavirin-free treatment for adults with HCV infection across all major genotypes (GT1-6). MAVIRET is also indicated for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those with compensated cirrhosis across all major genotypes, and those who previously had limited treatment options, such as patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV infection.•In August 2017, the FDA approved MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). MAVYRET is also 2017 Form 10-K | 31indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment.Other•In September 2017, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for elagolix, an investigational, orally administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, being evaluated for the management of endometriosis with associated pain. In October, AbbVie was granted priority review for elagolix by the FDA for the management of endometriosis with associated pain. In November, AbbVie announced detailed results from two replicate Phase 3 extension studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix, being evaluated for the management of endometriosis with associated pain.•In December 2017, AbbVie announced the strategic decision to close the SONAR study, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effects of the investigational compound atrasentan on progression of kidney disease in patients with stage 2 to 4 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes when added to standard of care. The ongoing monitoring of renal events observed in the study revealed considerably fewer endpoints than expected at the time of analysis, which will likely affect the ability to test the SONAR study hypothesis. Therefore, AbbVie determined that it cannot justify continuing the participation of patients in the study. The decision to close the SONAR study early was not related to any safety concerns.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet RevenuesThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The sales increases in 2017 and 2016 were driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. The sales increase in 2016 was also driven by the approval of new indications. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 18% in 2017 and 24% in 2016. The sales increase in 2017 was driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. The sales increase in 2016 was driven by market growth across all indications, higher market share and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 7% in 2017 and 4% in 2016, driven primarily by market growth across indications. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA.Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA commenced following the completion of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, 2015. Global IMBRUVICA sales increased 40% in 2017 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. The sales increase in 2016 was driven by market share gains following the FDA and EMA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as having a full year of sales in 2016.Global HCV sales decreased 16% in 2017 and 6% in 2016. The sales decrease in 2017 and 2016 was a result of market contraction, lower market share and price erosion of VIEKIRA. These factors were partially offset for 2017 by the launch of MAVYRET in certain geographies during the second half of 2017.Net revenues for Creon increased 14% in 2017 and 15% in 2016, driven primarily by continued market growth and higher market share. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.Global Kaletra net revenues decreased 25% in 2017 and 17% in 2016, primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the HIV marketplace. AbbVie expects net revenues for Kaletra to continue to decline in 2018.Net revenues for Duodopa increased 20% in 2017 and 28% in 2016, primarily as a result of market penetration and geographic expansion.Gross Margin Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20172016201520172016Gross margin$21,176 $19,805 $18,359 7% 8%as a percent of net revenues75% 77% 80% Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million in 2017, as well as the unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization and the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. These drivers were partially offset by lower amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics as well as favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies.Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization, the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement and higher amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics. Additionally, 2016 gross margin included an intangible asset impairment charge of $39 million and 2015 gross margin included milestone revenue of $40 million from an oncology collaboration partner. These drivers were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies.34 | 2017 Form 10-K Selling, General and Administrative Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20172016201520172016Selling, general and administrative$6,275 $5,855 $6,387 7% (8)%as a percent of net revenues22% 23% 28% SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 due to continued leverage from revenue growth partially offset by litigation reserve charges of $370 million in 2017 and new product launch expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to continued leverage from revenue growth and lower costs in 2016. SG&A expenses in 2015 included costs associated with the separation from Abbott of $265 million, Pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $294 million and litigation reserve charges of $165 million. Additionally, SG&A expense in 2015 reflected marketing support for the global launch of VIEKIRA.Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Research and development$4,982 $4,366 $4,285 14% 2%as a percent of net revenues18% 17% 19% Acquired in-process research and development$327 $200 $150 64% 33%Research and Development (R&D) expenses in 2017 increased from 2016 principally due to increased funding to support the company’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets, the impact of the post-acquisition R&D expenses of Stemcentrx and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) compounds and an increase in development milestones of $63 million. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs of $135 million.R&D expenses in 2016 increased from 2015 due primarily to increased funding to support the company’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets. This increase was partially offset by the following factors: (i) 2015 R&D expenses included a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party; (ii) development milestones decreased by $53 million; and (iii) 2015 results included restructuring charges of $32 million.Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2016. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2015 included a charge of $100 million as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N Diagnostics (C2N) to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector and C2N agreements.Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions) 2017 2016 2015Interest expense $1,150 $1,047 $719Interest income (146) (82) (33)Interest expense, net $1,004 $965$686 Net foreign exchange loss $348 $303 $193Other expense, net 513 232 13Interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. 2017 Form 10-K | 35Interest expense in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics in addition to the incremental expense associated with the May 2016 senior notes issuance discussed above. Interest expense in 2016 also included a debt extinguishment charge of $39 million related to the redemption of the 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. These increases were partially offset by the absence of bridge financing-related costs of $86 million in 2015 incurred in connection with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics. Interest income continued to increase in both 2017 and 2016 due to growth in the company’s investment securities.Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVie’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation. Net foreign exchange loss in 2015 included losses of $170 million to complete the liquidation of the company’s remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with Shire.Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities of $626 million in 2017 and $228 million in 2016. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2017, the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. In 2016, the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million. Other expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 31% in 2017, 24% in 2016 and 23% in 2015. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2017 over the prior year was principally due to the estimated tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes.The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates a territorial tax system that includes new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As a result, the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act.The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. The effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances.FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)2017 2016 2015Cash flows from: Operating activities$9,960 $7,041 $7,535Investing activities(274) (6,074) (12,936)Financing activities(5,512) (3,928) 5,752Operating cash flows in 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, an improvement in operating earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows in 2016 36 | 2017 Form 10-K decreased from 2015 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin, offset by income tax payments. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $71 million in 2017 and were presented within operating cash flows as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. Prior to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement, realized excess benefits of $55 million in 2016 and $61 million in 2015 were presented within cash flows from financing activities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie's voluntary contributions, primarily to its principal domestic defined benefit plan of $150 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In 2018, AbbVie plans to make voluntary contributions to its various defined benefit plans in excess of $750 million.Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million. Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, a $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016, net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $479 million. Investing activities in 2015 primarily included $11.5 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Pharmacyclics in May 2015 (net of cash acquired of $877 million). Investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to Calico, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with C2N to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders and $130 million paid to Infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. Cash flows from investing activities in 2015 also included capital expenditures of $532 million.In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $400 million as of December 31, 2017 and $377 million as of December 31, 2016. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. In connection with the offering, AbbVie incurred $17 million of issuance costs. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ASR transactions. In connection with the May 2016 issuance of senior notes, AbbVie incurred $52 million of issuance costs.In May 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an ASR. In 2015, the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18.0 billion, 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the bridge loan) as well as $93 million of costs relating to the May 2015 issuance of senior notes. No amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes. In September 2015, AbbVie entered into a three-year $2.0 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2.0 billion term loan credit facility. In November 2015, AbbVie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. Cash dividend payments totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate. On October 27, 2017, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.71 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 12, 2018. This reflects an increase of approximately 11% over the previous quarterly rate. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.71 per share to $0.96 per share beginning with the dividend payable on May 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 13, 2018. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. In addition to the ASRs, under AbbVie's existing stock repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017, approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 and approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in 2015 . AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016. The stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's 2017 Form 10-K | 37discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase program permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions, including accelerated share repurchases, at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time.In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows.Cash and equivalents were impacted by net favorable exchange rate changes totaling $29 million in 2017, net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 and $300 million in 2015. The favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, a significant portion of cash and equivalents were considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries. The enactment of U.S. tax reform significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system, including imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the creation of a territorial tax system that generally allows the repatriation of future foreign sourced earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes. The company has not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional estimate of the one-time transition tax was $4.5 billion and is generally payable in eight annual installments. AbbVie does not expect the transition tax liability to materially affect its liquidity and capital resources.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.AbbVie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, which have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions. Substantially all of AbbVie's trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain are with government health systems. Outstanding governmental receivables in these countries, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, totaled $255 million as of December 31, 2017 and $244 million at December 31, 2016. The company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries that have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, which may result in delays in the collection of receivables. Outstanding governmental receivables related to Saudi Arabia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $149 million as of December 31, 2017 and $122 million as of December 31, 2016. Outstanding governmental receivables related to Russia, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, were $152 million as of December 31, 2017 and $110 million as of December 31, 2016. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses.Currently, AbbVie does not believe the economic conditions in oil-exporting countries will have a significant impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. However, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, AbbVie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of December 31, 2017.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityAbbVie currently has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility which matures in October 2019. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.38 | 2017 Form 10-K Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsThere were no changes in the company’s credit ratings in 2017. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. 2017 Form 10-K | 39Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:(in millions)Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsShort-term borrowings$400 $400 $— $— $—Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion37,612 6,026 5,469 5,938 20,179Interest on long-term debt(a)15,617 1,154 2,250 2,080 10,133Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments957 143 235 151 428Purchase obligations and other(b)1,135 972 115 46 2Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) (e) (f)10,605 1,135 1,610 1,331 6,529Total$66,326 $9,830 $9,679 $9,546 $37,271(a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2017. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2017. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2017.(b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.(c)Amounts less than one year includes voluntary contributions in excess of $750 million that AbbVie plans to make to its various defined benefit plans subsequent to December 31, 2017. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension and other post-employment benefit plans.(d)Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.(e)Includes $4.5 billion of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.(f)Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform, enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the provisional estimates of these tax liabilities.AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.40 | 2017 Form 10-K CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $12.9 billion in 2017, $10.8 billion in 2016 and $8.6 billion in 2015. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 92% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2017. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates WholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2014$712 $476 $253Provisions1,716 2,215 3,866Payments(1,396) (1,771) (3,756)Balance at December 31, 20151,032 920 363Provisions2,606 3,146 3,987Payments(2,471) (2,899) (3,967)Balance at December 31, 20161,167 1,167 383Provisions2,909 3,990 5,026Payments(2,736) (3,962) (4,887)Balance at December 31, 2017$1,340 $1,195 $522 2017 Form 10-K | 41Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.3 billion in 2017, $964 million in 2016 and $898 million in 2015, are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates. The significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2017. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017: 50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseDefined benefit plans Service and interest cost$(64) $72Projected benefit obligation(572) 652Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost$(9) $11Projected benefit obligation(77) 89Effective December 31, 2015, AbbVie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. Historically, AbbVie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. In late 2015, AbbVie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. AbbVie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. AbbVie accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. This change reduced AbbVie’s net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016. This change had no effect on the 2015 expense and did not affect the measurement of AbbVie’s total benefit obligations.The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2017 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2018 by $54 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of 42 | 2017 Form 10-K December 31, 2017 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2018. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2018 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017: One percentage point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseService and interest cost$31 $(24)Projected benefit obligation183 (140)Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test.For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The 2017 Form 10-K | 43estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2017, a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $170 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2017, a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $390 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016(in millions)Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivableReceive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro$6,366 1.175 $(88) $5,544 1.078 $102Japanese yen940 112.4 2 935 111.6 39British pound760 1.310 (22) 611 1.303 35All other currencies1,877 n/a (18) 1,693 n/a 11Total$9,943 $(126) $8,783 $187The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. The functional currency of the company’s Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the Divisa Complementaria (DICOM) rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2017, AbbVie’s net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant.Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $509 million at December 31, 2017. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2017 Form 10-K | 45Market Price RiskAbbVie’s debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2017. If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the income statement in the period sold. Non-Publicly Traded Equity SecuritiesAbbVie holds equity securities in other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $48 million as of December 31, 2017 and $42 million as of December 31, 2016. AbbVie monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value and charges impairment losses to net earnings when an other than temporary decline in estimated value occurs. In 2017 and 2016, impairment charges recorded were insignificant. In 2015, AbbVie recorded impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's investments in non-publicly traded equity securities.46 | 2017 Form 10-K",2023-12-30 16:57:37.788148
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. 2018 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2018 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $32.8 billion, operating earnings of $6.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $3.66 and cash flows from operations of $13.4 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 16%, or 15% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by revenue growth related to MAVYRET, IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and the continued strength of HUMIRA.Diluted earnings per share in 2018 was $3.66 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $4.1 billion net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.1 billion of intangible asset amortization; (iii) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico); (iv) $424 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (v) $478 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities excluding the fair value adjustment associated with the Stemcentrx-related impairment; (vi) litigation reserve charges of $282 million; (vii) charitable contributions of $271 million as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan to make contributions to U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018; and (viii) milestone payments of $137 million. 2018 financial results were also impacted by U.S. tax reform and the timing of the new legislation's phase in on certain subsidiaries. Additionally, financial results reflected continued added funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands.In November 2018, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock payable in February 2019. This reflected an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share of common stock.26 | 2018 Form 10-K 2019 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (ii) continued investment and expansion in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.•The strong execution of new product launches across multiple therapeutic areas.•HUMIRA U.S. sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories and maintaining market leadership.•Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion.•The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2019. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.Research and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologyUpadacitinib•In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.•In April 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-COMPARE clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are on a stable background of methotrexate and who have an inadequate response.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rates. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.Rova-T•In March 2018, AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 2 TRINITY study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) for third-line R/R small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although Rova-T demonstrated single agent responses in advanced SCLC patients, after consulting with the FDA, based on the magnitude of effect across multiple parameters in this single-arm study, the company will not seek accelerated approval for Rova-T in third-line R/R SCLC.•In December 2018, AbbVie announced the decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating Rova-T as a second-line therapy for advanced SCLC. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in TAHOE due to shorter overall survival in the Rova-T arm compared with the topotecan control arm. AbbVie will continue its ongoing Phase 3 study of Rova-T in first-line SCLC.Other•In November 2018, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) announced that the FDA expanded the label for Empliciti in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies. BMS and AbbVie are co-developing Empliciti, with BMS solely responsible for commercial activities. 2018 Form 10-K | 29Virology/Liver Disease•In November 2018, AbbVie presented EXPEDITION 8 data at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), in which 8 weeks of MAVYRET in treatment naïve, cirrhotic patients was safe and effective with no virologic failures reported.Neuroscience•In March 2018, Biogen and AbbVie announced the voluntary worldwide withdrawal of marketing authorizations for ZINBRYTA, a prescription medicine used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.Other•In February 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-I study evaluating elagolix, an investigational, orally administered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, being investigated in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids met its primary efficacy endpoint and all ranked secondary endpoints.•In March 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-II study evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids met its primary efficacy endpoint and all ranked secondary endpoints.•In July 2018, the FDA approved ORILISSA (elagolix) for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.•In August 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 ELARIS UF-EXTEND study evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy for uterine fibroids were consistent with findings observed in the ELARIS UF-I and ELARIS UF-II Phase 3 studies.•In October 2018, AbbVie announced that it will assume full development and commercial responsibility for its collaboration with Galapagos to discover and develop new therapies to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). Under a revised agreement, AbbVie will assume full development and commercial responsibility over the investigational program comprising several clinical and pre-clinical compounds originally discovered and developed jointly by AbbVie and Galapagos. Galapagos will not pursue further research and development in CF, but is eligible for future milestones and royalties on commercialized programs.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet RevenuesThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The sales increases in 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 11% in 2018 and 18% in 2017. The sales increase in 2018 and 2017 was driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 1% in 2018 and 7% in 2017. The sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. Due to the entry of biosimilar competition, AbbVie expects international HUMIRA net revenues to decline in 2019. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA.Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 39% in 2018 and 40% in 2017 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing.Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2018 primarily due to market share gains following FDA and EMA approvals of VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan for certain patients with R/R CLL.Global MAVYRET sales increased by more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion in 2018. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 76% in 2018 and 49% in 2017 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET.Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2018 and 14% in 2017, driven primarily by continued market growth, higher market share and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.AndroGel net revenues decreased 19% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 primarily due to market contraction and the entry of generic competition for the AndroGel 1.62% formulation in October 2018. AbbVie expects net revenues for AndroGel to continue to decline in 2019.Net revenues for Duodopa increased 18% in 2018 and 20% in 2017, primarily as a result of market penetration.Gross Margin Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Gross margin$25,035 $21,174 $19,806 18% 7%as a percent of net revenues76% 75% 77% Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million in 2017, as well as the unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization and the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. These drivers were partially offset by lower amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics as well as favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies.Selling, General and Administrative Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Selling, general and administrative$7,399 $6,295 $5,881 18% 7%as a percent of net revenues23% 22% 23% Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of new product launch expenses and charitable contributions of $350 million to 32 | 2018 Form 10-K select U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018 as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth. SG&A expense percentage in 2017 decreased from 2016. SG&A expense percentage in 2017 was favorably impacted by continued leverage from revenue growth partially offset by litigation reserves charges that increased by $370 million in 2017 compared to the prior year and new product launch expenses.Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Research and development$10,329 $5,007 $4,385 >100% 14%as a percent of net revenues32% 18% 17% Acquired in-process research and development$424 $327 $200 30% 64%Research and Development (R&D) expenses in 2018 increased from 2017 principally due to a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge related to IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial. The impairment was primarily due to lower probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. The remaining increase reflected greater funding to support all stages of the company's pipeline assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge.R&D expenses in 2017 increased from 2016 principally due to increased funding to support all stages of the company’s pipeline assets, the impact of the post-acquisition R&D expenses of Stemcentrx and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) compounds and an increase in development milestones of $63 million. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs of $135 million.Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2018. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2016. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement.Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer.Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016Interest expense $1,348 $1,150 $1,047Interest income (204) (146) (82)Interest expense, net $1,144 $1,004$965 Net foreign exchange loss $24 $348 $303Other expense, net 18 466 188Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018. Interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Interest income in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in the company’s investment securities. 2018 Form 10-K | 33Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVie’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation.Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities of $49 million in 2018, $626 million in 2017 and $228 million in 2016. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2018, the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. The increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. In 2017, the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. In 2016, the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was negative 9% in 2018, was 31% in 2017 and was 24% in 2016. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the impact of the effective date of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses. Given these factors, the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods.The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes.The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act.The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations.FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)2018 2017 2016Cash flows from: Operating activities$13,427 $9,960 $7,041Investing activities(1,006) (274) (6,074)Financing activities(14,396) (5,512) (3,928)Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows in 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, an improvement in operating earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $78 million in 2018 and $71 million in 2017 and were presented within operating cash flows as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. Prior to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement, realized excess benefits of $55 million in 2016 were presented within cash flows from financing activities. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $873 million in 2018, $246 million in 2017 and $273 million in 2016.34 | 2018 Form 10-K Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million. Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million. Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, a $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016, net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $479 million.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $699 million as of December 31, 2018 and $400 million as of December 31, 2017. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.Financing cash flows in 2018 also included proceeds from the issuance of a $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement (term loan) entered into in May 2018. In June 2018, the company drew on this term loan and as of December 31, 2018, $3.0 billion was outstanding and was included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at one month LIBOR plus applicable margin. The term loan may be prepaid without penalty upon prior notice and contains customary covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2018. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. The company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay term loan obligations in 2019 as they become due. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an accelerated share repurchase (ASR). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2016 ASR transaction.Cash dividend payments totaled $5.6 billion in 2018, $4.1 billion in 2017 and $3.7 billion in 2016. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 2, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2019 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2019. This reflects an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018.Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018, approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 and approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016. AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016.In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows. 2018 Form 10-K | 35Cash and equivalents were impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $39 million in 2018, net favorable exchange rate changes totaling $29 million in 2017 and net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2018 were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityIn August 2018, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2018, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsThere were no changes in the company’s credit ratings during 2018. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt obligations.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:(in millions)Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsShort-term borrowings$3,699 $3,699 $— $— $—Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion37,360 1,612 6,808 6,370 22,570Interest on long-term debt(a)17,204 1,433 2,613 2,024 11,134Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments809 116 205 145 343Purchase obligations and other(b)1,843 1,710 110 21 2Other long-term liabilities(c) (d) (e) (f)9,994 736 1,392 1,478 6,388Total$70,909 $9,306 $11,128 $10,038 $40,43736 | 2018 Form 10-K (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2018. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018.(b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.(c)Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million that AbbVie made to its principal domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2018. Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of future funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension and other post-employment benefit plans.(d)Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.(e)Includes $4.5 billion of contingent consideration liabilities primarily related to the acquisition of BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.(f)Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities.AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. 2018 Form 10-K | 37Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $16.4 billion in 2018, $12.9 billion in 2017 and $10.8 billion in 2016. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 91% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2018. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates WholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2015$1,032 $920 $363Provisions2,606 3,146 3,987Payments(2,471) (2,899) (3,967)Balance at December 31, 20161,167 1,167 383Provisions2,909 3,990 5,026Payments(2,736) (3,962) (4,887)Balance at December 31, 20171,340 1,195 522Provisions3,493 4,729 6,659Payments(3,188) (4,485) (6,525)Balance at December 31, 2018$1,645 $1,439 $656Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2018, $1.3 billion in 2017 and $964 million in 2016, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.38 | 2018 Form 10-K The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2018. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018: 50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseDefined benefit plans Service and interest cost$(54) $64Projected benefit obligation(512) 578Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost$(2) $4Projected benefit obligation(47) 54The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2019 by $62 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018: One percentage point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseService and interest cost$17 $(9)Projected benefit obligation110 (87)Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum 2018 Form 10-K | 39loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2018, a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $160 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2018, a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $420 million.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements.40 | 2018 Form 10-K ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017(in millions)Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro$6,660 1.157 $68 $6,366 1.175 $(88)Japanese yen1,076 111.5 (12) 940 112.4 2British pound499 1.328 21 760 1.310 (22)All other currencies1,776 n/a 29 1,877 n/a (18)Total$10,011 $106 $9,943 $(126)The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $403 million at December 31, 2018. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.4 billion at December 31, 2018. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price RiskAbbVie’s debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $16 million as of December 31, 2018. If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the statement of earnings in the period sold. 2018 Form 10-K | 41",2023-12-30 16:57:37.145541
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2020,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition.2019 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2019 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $33.3 billion, operating earnings of $13.0 billion, diluted earnings per share of $5.28 and cash flows from operations of $13.3 billion. Worldwide net revenues grew by 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA as well as the continued strength of HUMIRA in the U.S. and newly launched immunology assets SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, offset by international HUMIRA biosimilar competition.Diluted earnings per share in 2019 was $5.28 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $3.2 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.3 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $823 million net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) $364 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and (v) $338 million of expenses related to the proposed Allergan acquisition. These costs were partially offset by the following after-tax benefits: (i) $414 million from litigation matters primarily due to the settlement of an intellectual property dispute with a third party; (ii) $400 million due to the favorable resolution of various tax positions; and (iii) $297 million from an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata). Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.In November 2019, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock payable in February 2020. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock.26 | 2019 Form 10-K 2020 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches and driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market; (ii) continuing to invest and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing incremental debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•Completion and successful integration of the proposed Allergan acquisition.•Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.•Immunology revenue growth driven by successful commercial launches of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, as well as HUMIRA U.S. sales growth. •Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion.•The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2020. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan will create a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline will be enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio will benefit from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Research and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, approximately 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next 12 months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologyRINVOQ•In February 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review AbbVie's New Drug Application (NDA) for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).•In February 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with giant cell arteritis. 2019 Form 10-K | 27•In August 2019, the FDA approved RINVOQ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.•In October 2019, AbbVie announced top-line results from its first Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Results from the SELECT-PsA 2 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.•In November 2019, AbbVie announced data from the Phase 2/3 SELECT-AXIS 1 trial in which twice as many adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with RINVOQ achieved the primary endpoint at week 14 versus placebo. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.•In November 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis.•In December 2019, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for RINVOQ for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs.•In February 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active PsA. Results from the SELECT-PsA 1 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more non-biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected.SKYRIZI•In March 2019, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, in subjects with psoriatic arthritis.•In April 2019, the FDA approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.•In April 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.OncologyIMBRUVICA•In January 2019, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with GAZYVA (obinutuzumab), for adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).•In June 2019, AbbVie announced results from the Phase 3 CLL12 trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL, which demonstrated that IMBRUVICA significantly improved event- and progression-free survival.•In November 2019, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab for the first-line treatment of younger patients with CLL or SLL.VENCLEXTA•In March 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The partial clinical hold followed a review of data from the ongoing Phase 3 BELLINI trial, a study in relapsed/refractory MM, in which a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the VENCLEXTA arm compared to the control arm of the trial. In June 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the Phase 3 CANOVA trial, evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of relapsed/refractory MM positive for the translocation (11;14) abnormality, based upon agreement on revisions to the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. This action does not impact any of the approved indications for VENCLEXTA, such as CLL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).28 | 2019 Form 10-K •In May 2019, the FDA approved VENCLEXTA, in combination with obinutuzumab, for adult patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. The approval was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL, which demonstrated that VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab prolonged progression-free survival and achieved higher rates of complete response and minimal residual disease-negativity compared to commonly used standard of care obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil.•In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion for VENCLYXTO in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with previously untreated CLL.Depatux-M•In May 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 INTELLANCE-1 study of depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M, previously known as ABT-414) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, whose tumors have EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) amplification, at an interim analysis. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in INTELLANCE-1 due to lack of survival benefit for patients receiving Depatux-M compared with placebo when added to the standard regimen of radiation and temozolomide. Enrollment has been halted in all ongoing Depatux-M studies.Veliparib•In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 BROCADE3 study evaluating veliparib, an investigational, oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with HER2 negative germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer.•In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 VELIA study, conducted in collaboration with the GOG Foundation, Inc., evaluating veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by veliparib maintenance therapy met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status.Rova-T•In August 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to terminate the MERU trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as a first-line maintenance therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended terminating the study after results demonstrated no survival benefit at a pre-planned interim analysis for patients receiving Rova-T as compared with placebo. With the closing of the MERU trial, AbbVie announced the termination of the Rova-T research and development program.Virology/Liver Disease•In August 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with genotype (GT)1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 infection.•In September 2019, the FDA approved MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients across all genotypes (GT1-6).•In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the CHMP of the EMA has recommended a change to the marketing authorization for MAVIRET to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with GT 3 infection.Neuroscience•In May 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-951, a subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, in subjects with Parkinson's disease.•In July 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 2 ARISE study evaluating ABBV-8E12, an investigational anti-tau antibody, in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, after an Independent Data 2019 Form 10-K | 29Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial for futility after the trial showed that ABBV-8E12 did not provide efficacy.Other•In July 2019, AbbVie submitted an NDA to the FDA for elagolix in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) daily add-back therapy for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet RevenuesThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets, partially offset by market growth across therapeutic categories. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 9% in 2019 and 11% in 2018. The sales increases in 2019 and 2018 were primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues decreased 28% in 2019 and increased 1% in 2018. The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA.Net revenues for SKYRIZI were $355 million in 2019 following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Net revenues for RINVOQ were $47 million in 2019 following the August 2019 FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 30% in 2019 and 39% in 2018 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing.Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to market share gains following additional regulatory approvals of VENCLEXTA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML in 2018 and first-line CLL in 2019.Global MAVYRET sales decreased by 15% in 2019 primarily driven by lower patient volumes in certain international markets and competitive dynamics in the U.S. Global MAVYRET sales increased more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 78% in 2019 and 76% in 2018 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET.Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2019 and 12% in 2018, primarily driven by continued market growth and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.Net revenues for Duodopa increased 12% in 2019 and 18% in 2018, primarily driven by increased market penetration.Gross Margin Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2019 2018 2017 2019 2018Gross margin$25,827 $25,035 $21,174 3% 18%as a percent of net revenues78% 76% 75% Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 increased from 2018 primarily due to the full year effect of the expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement and unfavorable impact from higher intangible asset amortization. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. 32 | 2019 Form 10-K Selling, General and Administrative Percent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2019 2018 2017 2019 2018Selling, general and administrative$6,942 $7,399 $6,295 (6)% 18%as a percent of net revenues21% 23% 22% Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 decreased from 2018 primarily due to the favorable impacts of international HUMIRA expense reductions and lower litigation reserve charges that decreased by $326 million. This favorability was partially offset by new product launch expenses, higher restructuring charges and $103 million of transaction expenses associated with the proposed Allergan transaction. Additionally, SG&A expenses in 2018 included non-recurring philanthropic contributions of $350 million to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations.SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to new product launch expenses and non-recurring philanthropic contributions to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth.

In 2019, the company recorded a $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired following the decision to terminate the Rova-T R&D program. In 2018, the company recorded a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial, which lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these impairment charges.Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019 or 2018. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement.Other Operating Expenses and IncomeOther operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Calico agreement. 2019 Form 10-K | 33Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017Interest expense $1,784 $1,348 $1,150Interest income (275) (204) (146)Interest expense, net $1,509 $1,144 $1,004 Net foreign exchange loss $42 $24 $348Other expense, net 3,006 18 466Interest expense in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to $363 million of incremental interest and debt issuance costs associated with financing the proposed acquisition of Allergan, as well as the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations. Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018.Interest income in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance during 2019, partially offset by decreased investments in debt securities. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $3.1 billion in 2019, $49 million in 2018 and $626 million in 2017. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2019, the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program during the third quarter of 2019. In 2018, the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. This increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage Stemcentrx assets. In 2017, the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 6% in 2019, negative 9% in 2018 and 31% in 2017. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2019 over the prior year was principally due to the timing of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. The increase is also attributable to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including a change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. These increases were partially offset by the favorable resolution of various tax positions in the current year.The effective tax rate for 2018 also included the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses.The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes.34 | 2019 Form 10-K The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act.FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)2019 2018 2017Cash flows from: Operating activities$13,324 $13,427 $9,960Investing activities596 (1,006) (274)Financing activities18,708 (14,396) (5,512)Operating cash flows in 2019 decreased slightly from 2018 primarily due to higher payments for income taxes offset by improved results of operations resulting from an increase in operating earnings. Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $727 million in 2019, $873 million in 2018 and $246 million in 2017.Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million. Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million. Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million. Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes at maturities ranging from 18 months to 30 years. AbbVie expects to use the net proceeds of $29.8 billion to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the proposed acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition, the net proceeds from the offering are permitted to be invested temporarily in short-term investments. All of the notes are subject to special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if the proposed acquisition of Allergan is not completed by January 30, 2021 or the company notifies the trustee in respect of the notes that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition.Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Financing cash flows in 2018 included proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion drawn under the term loan in June 2018. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and there was $699 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.Cash dividend payments totaled $6.4 billion in 2019, $5.6 billion in 2018 and $4.1 billion in 2017. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 1, 2019, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.07 per share to $1.18 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2020 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2020. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's 2019 Form 10-K | 35debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019 and 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2019.Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018 and 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017. AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017.In 2019, AbbVie made contingent consideration milestone and royalty payments to BI totaling $234 million following the commercial launch of SKYRIZI in certain geographies. $163 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $71 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows.In connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan, on June 25, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $38.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and on July 12, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement. The company incurred a total of $242 million of debt issuance costs related to the two agreements. On October 25, 2019, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for up to $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount and €3.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash, subject to conditions including the closing of the proposed acquisition. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In February 2020, the remaining commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $0 as a result of cash on hand at AbbVie. AbbVie subsequently terminated the bridge credit agreement in its entirety as permitted under its terms.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityIn August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.36 | 2019 Form 10-K Credit RatingsFollowing the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Allergan and the $30.0 billion senior notes issuance, Moody's Investor Service affirmed its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable and expects to lower the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1 when the acquisition is complete.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:(in millions)Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsLong-term debt, including current portion$67,233 $3,750 $14,150 $7,625 $41,708Interest on long-term debt(a)30,494 2,146 4,087 3,479 20,782Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments(f)774 129 224 125 296Purchase obligations and other(b)3,532 3,295 186 45 6Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e)11,544 166 1,395 2,123 7,860Total$113,577 $9,486 $20,042 $13,397 $70,652(a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2019. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019.(b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.(c)Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.(d)Includes $7.3 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.(e)Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities.(f)Lease payments include approximately $350 million of contractual minimum lease payments for leases executed but not yet commenced. These leases will commence in 2020 with lease terms of approximately 11 years. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual 2019 Form 10-K | 37obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $18.8 billion in 2019, $16.4 billion in 2018 and $12.9 billion in 2017. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.38 | 2019 Form 10-K The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2019. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates WholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2016$1,167 $1,167 $383Provisions2,909 3,990 5,026Payments(2,736) (3,962) (4,887)Balance at December 31, 20171,340 1,195 522Provisions3,493 4,729 6,659Payments(3,188) (4,485) (6,525)Balance at December 31, 20181,645 1,439 656Provisions4,035 5,772 7,947Payments(3,915) (5,275) (7,917)Balance at December 31, 2019$1,765 $1,936 $686Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2019, $1.6 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2017, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2019. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019: 50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseDefined benefit plans Service and interest cost$(76) $92Projected benefit obligation(723) 825Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost$(11) $14Projected benefit obligation(101) 117The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The 2019 Form 10-K | 39current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2020 by $71 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019: One percentage point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)Increase DecreaseService and interest cost$40 $(28)Projected benefit obligation244 (186)Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial 40 | 2019 Form 10-K performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2019, a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $280 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $150 million.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements. 2019 Form 10-K | 41ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018(in millions)Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro$6,217 1.116 $(12) $6,660 1.157 $68Japanese yen820 108.7 — 1,076 111.5 (12)Canadian dollar504 1.324 (6) 406 1.314 14British pound427 1.305 (6) 499 1.328 21All other currencies1,508 n/a (10) 1,370 n/a 15Total$9,476 $(34) $10,011 $106The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $942 million at December 31, 2019. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2019, the company has €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $280 million at December 31, 2019. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 42 | 2019 Form 10-K",2023-12-30 16:57:34.335902

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 47,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2020 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2020 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $45.8 billion, operating earnings of $11.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.72 and cash flows from operations of $17.6 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 38% on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis, which included $10.3 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Imbruvica and Venclexta.Diluted earnings per share in 2020 was $2.72 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $5.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $4.8 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) $3.0 billion of Allergan acquisition and integration expenses; (iv) $1.2 billion for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and $241 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses. These costs were partially offset by $1.7 billion of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.In October 2020, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock payable in February 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock.Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50% realized in R&D, 40% in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and 10% in cost of products sold.2020 Form 10-K | 32To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, AbbVie announced that it entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver food and essential supplies during the crisis. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.2021 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and expanding patient access of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth. •Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both Imbruvica and Venclexta.•Expansion of the company’s revenue base from additional Allergan products contributing to key aesthetics and neuroscience portfolios.•Effective management of Humira international biosimilar erosion.•Optimization of combined AbbVie and Allergan research and development, commercial, and manufacturing operations while maintaining key growth portfolios.•The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2021. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.The combination of AbbVie and Allergan creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure.33 | 2020 Form 10-KResearch and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs.

In July 2020, AbbVie withdrew the regulatory application with the EMA for abicipar pegol for the treatment of nAMD.Women's HealthOriahnn•In May 2020, the FDA approved Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet RevenuesThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended (dollars in millions)2020201920182020201920202019United States$34,879 $23,907 $21,524 45.9 %11.1 %45.9 %11.1 %International10,925 9,359 11,229 16.7 %(16.7)%17.8 %(13.6)%Net revenues$45,804 $33,266 $32,753 37.7 %1.6 %38.0 %2.6 %2020 Form 10-K | 36The following table details AbbVie's worldwide net revenues:Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2020201920182020201920202019ImmunologyHumiraUnited States$16,112 $14,864 $13,685 8.4 %8.6 %8.4 %8.6 %International3,720 4,305 6,251 (13.6)%(31.1)%(12.5)%(27.8)%Total$19,832 $19,169 $19,936 3.5 %(3.9)%3.7 %(2.9)%SkyriziUnited States$1,385 $311 $— >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mInternational205 44 — >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mTotal$1,590 $355 $— >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mRinvoqUnited States$653 $47 $— >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mInternational78 — — >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mTotal$731 $47 $— >100.0%n/m>100.0%n/mHematologic OncologyImbruvicaUnited States$4,305 $3,830 $2,968 12.4 %29.1 %12.4 %29.1 %Collaboration revenues1,009 844 622 19.5 %35.8 %19.5 %35.8 %Total$5,314 $4,674 $3,590 13.7 %30.2 %13.7 %30.2 %VenclextaUnited States$804 $521 $247 54.4 %>100.0%54.4 %>100.0%International533 271 97 97.0 %>100.0%97.8 %>100.0%Total$1,337 $792 $344 69.0 %>100.0%69.3 %>100.0%AestheticsBotox Cosmetic (a)United States$687 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational425 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$1,112 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mJuvederm Collection (a)United States$318 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational400 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$718 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mOther Aesthetics (a)United States$666 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational94 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$760 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mNeuroscienceBotox Therapeutic (a)United States$1,155 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational232 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$1,387 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mVraylar (a)United States$951 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mDuodopaUnited States$103 $97 $80 5.9 %20.4 %5.9 %20.4 %International391 364 350 7.4 %4.2 %6.3 %9.8 %Total$494 $461 $430 7.1 %7.2 %6.2 %11.7 %Ubrelvy (a)United States$125 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mOther Neuroscience (a)United States$528 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational11 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$539 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/m37 | 2020 Form 10-KPercent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2020201920182020201920202019Eye CareLumigan/Ganfort (a)United States$165 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational213 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$378 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mAlphagan/Combigan (a)United States$223 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational103 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$326 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mRestasis (a)United States$755 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational32 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$787 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mOther Eye Care (a)United States$305 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational388 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$693 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mWomen's HealthLo Loestrin (a)United States$346 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational10 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$356 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mOrilissa/OriahnnUnited States$121 $91 $11 33.3 %>100.0%33.3 %>100.0%International4 2 — 96.1 %n/m97.7 %n/mTotal$125 $93 $11 34.6 %>100.0%34.6 %>100.0%Other Women's Health (a)United States$181 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational11 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$192 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mOther Key ProductsMavyretUnited States$785 $1,473 $1,614 (46.7)%(8.8)%(46.7)%(8.8)%International1,045 1,420 1,824 (26.4)%(22.1)%(26.8)%(19.6)%Total$1,830 $2,893 $3,438 (36.7)%(15.9)%(36.9)%(14.6)%CreonUnited States$1,114 $1,041 $928 6.9 %12.2 %6.9 %12.2 %LupronUnited States$600 $720 $726 (16.6)%(0.8)%(16.6)%(0.8)%International152 167 166 (9.1)%0.8 %(5.4)%6.0 %Total$752 $887 $892 (15.2)%(0.5)%(14.5)%0.5 %Linzess/Constella (a)United States$649 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mInternational18 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$667 $— $— n/mn/mn/mn/mSynthroidUnited States$771 $786 $776 (1.9)%1.3 %(1.9)%1.3 %All other$2,923 $2,068 $2,408 41.3 %(14.1)%42.4 %(11.5)%Total net revenues$45,804 $33,266 $32,753 37.7 %1.6 %38.0 %2.6 %n/m – Not meaningful(a)Net revenues include Allergan product revenues from the date of the acquisition, May 8, 2020, through December 31, 2020.The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2020 driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 12% in 2020 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Biosimilar competition for Humira is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to maintain market leadership among its installed patient base and add to the sustainability of Humira.Net revenues for Skyrizi increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth and market share gains over the prior year following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Net revenues for Rinvoq increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by the August 2019 FDA approval and December 2019 EC approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.2020 Form 10-K | 38Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 14% in 2020 as a result of continued penetration of Imbruvica for patients with CLL, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Net revenues for Venclexta increased 69% in 2020 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML.Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics were $1.1 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics were $718 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas were $1.4 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression were $951 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Global Mavyret sales decreased 37% in 2020 primarily driven by lower global new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as competitive dynamics in the U.S.Net revenues for Creon increased 7% in 2020 primarily driven by continued market growth, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market with approximately 80% total market share.Net revenues for Lupron decreased 14% in 2020 primarily due to a near-term supply issue which has impacted product availability of certain formulations.Gross MarginPercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20202019201820202019Gross margin$30,417 $25,827 $25,035 18 %3 %as a percent of net revenues66 %78 %76 %Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value step-up adjustments associated with the Allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for Imbruvica and Venclexta.Selling, General and AdministrativePercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20202019201820202019Selling, general and administrative$11,299 $6,942 $7,399 63 %(6)%as a percent of net revenues25 %21 %23 %Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 increased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of incremental SG&A expenses of Allergan, including transaction and integration costs resulting from the acquisition.Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and DevelopmentPercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20202019201820202019Research and development$6,557 $6,407 $10,329 2 %(38)%as a percent of net revenues14 %19 %32 %Acquired in-process research and development$1,198 $385 $424 >100%(9)%Research and Development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2020 primarily due to the $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge in 2019, which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part 39 | 2020 Form 10-Kof the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to terminate the Rova-T R&D program. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 were also favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition.Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S (Genmab) to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Genmab and I-Mab agreements. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019.Other Operating Expenses and IncomeOther operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions)202020192018Interest expense$2,454 $1,784 $1,348 Interest income(174)(275)(204)Interest expense, net$2,280 $1,509 $1,144 Net foreign exchange loss$71 $42 $24 Other expense, net5,614 3,006 18 Interest expense in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with the financing of the Allergan acquisition as well as the incremental Allergan debt acquired, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s debt obligations.Interest income in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $5.8 billion in 2020 and $3.1 billion in 2019. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates. In 2019, the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was negative 36% in 2020, 6% in 2019 and negative 9% in 2018. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, the cost of repatriation decisions, tax audit settlements and Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement.2020 Form 10-K | 40FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)202020192018Cash flows from:Operating activities$17,588 $13,324 $13,427 Investing activities(37,557)596 (1,006)Financing activities(11,501)18,708 (14,396)Operating cash flows in 2020 increased from 2019 and included the results of Allergan subsequent to the May 8 acquisition date. Operating cash flows in 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows, partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $367 million in 2020 and $727 million in 2019.Investing cash flows in 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion. Investing cash flows also included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million. Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million.Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity, and the November 2020 repayments of €700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate Allergan exchange notes at maturity and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Allergan exchange notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Cash dividend payments totaled $7.7 billion in 2020 and $6.4 billion in 2019. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020 as well as an increase in the dividend rate. On October 30, 2020, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 16, 2021 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020.In 2020 and 2019, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an 41 | 2020 Form 10-Kallowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityAbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2020, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsFollowing the acquisition of Allergan, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:(in millions)TotalLess than one yearOne to three yearsThree to five yearsMore than five yearsShort-term borrowings$34 $34 $— $— $— Long-term debt, including current portion84,948 8,422 16,643 16,197 43,686 Interest on long-term debt(a)33,664 2,752 4,652 3,898 22,362 Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments1,154 229 323 208 394 Purchase obligations and other(b)5,432 5,040 249 112 31 Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e)18,478 1,029 3,036 4,144 10,269 Total$143,710 $17,506 $24,903 $24,559 $76,742 (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2020. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020.(b)Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.(c)Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.2020 Form 10-K | 42(d)Includes $13.0 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.(e)Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $27.0 billion in 2020, $18.8 billion in 2019 and $16.4 billion in 2018. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.43 | 2020 Form 10-KThe following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 89% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2020. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare RebatesManaged Care RebatesWholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2017$1,340 $1,195 $522 Provisions3,493 4,729 6,659 Payments(3,188)(4,485)(6,525)Balance at December 31, 20181,645 1,439 656 Provisions4,035 5,772 7,947 Payments(3,915)(5,275)(7,917)Balance at December 31, 20191,765 1,936 686 Additions(a)1,266 649 71 Provisions6,715 8,656 8,677 Payments(6,801)(8,334)(8,693)Balance at December 31, 2020$2,945 $2,907 $741 (a)Represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition.Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2021 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020:50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)IncreaseDecreaseDefined benefit plansService and interest cost$(89)$101 Projected benefit obligation(1,000)1,140 Other post-employment plansService and interest cost$(6)$7 Projected benefit obligation(56)63 2020 Form 10-K | 44The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2021 by $94 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. 45 | 2020 Form 10-KFor its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:RangeWeighted Average(a)Discount rate0.1% - 2.2%1.1%Probability of payment for unachieved milestones56% - 92%64%Probability of payment for royalties by indication(b)56% - 100%91%Projected year of payments2021 - 20342027(a)Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.(b)Excludes early stage indications with 0% estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100% probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56% to 89% at December 31, 2020.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019:20202019as of December 31 (in millions)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:Euro$7,818 1.213 $(39)$6,217 1.116 $(12)Japanese yen837 103.9 (7)820 108.7 — Canadian dollar591 1.328 (23)504 1.324 (6)British pound275 1.341 3 427 1.305 (6)All other currencies1,706 n/a(15)1,508 n/a(10)Total$11,227 $(81)$9,476 $(34)The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.14 billion at December 31, 2020. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2020, the company has €6.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $111 million at December 31, 2020. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 47 | 2020 Form 10-K",2023-12-30 16:57:28.832235

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2021 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2021 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.2 billion, operating earnings of $17.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.45 and cash flows from operations of $22.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 23% on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care portfolios as well as a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.Diluted earnings per share in 2021 was $6.45 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $948 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (iv) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC; (v) $307 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses; (vi) $253 million for charges related to litigation matters; and (vii) $215 million of acquisition and integration expenses. These costs were partially offset by $265 million of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.In October 2021, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share of common stock payable in February 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock.Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022.2021 Form 10-K | 32To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. AbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines.2022 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth. •Hematologic oncology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Venclexta, as well as maintaining the strong leadership position of Imbruvica. •Aesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.•Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and recently launched Qulipta.•Sustaining eye care leadership by maximizing AbbVie's current eye care portfolio. •The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2022. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.33 | 2021 Form 10-KResearch and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologySkyrizi•In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical trials of Skyrizi in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.•In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE induction studies of Skyrizi in patients with Crohn’s disease met the primary and key secondary endpoints.•In April 2021, AbbVie received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Skyrizi in a single dose pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen.

This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended (dollars in millions)2021202020192021202020212020United States$43,510 $34,879 $23,907 24.7 %45.9 %24.7 %45.9

AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2021 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year.Net revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets.39 | 2021 Form 10-KNet revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 2% in 2021 as a result of modest favorable pricing in the United States and increased collaboration revenues, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and share loss in the United States.Net revenues for Venclexta increased 34% in 2021 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML.Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics increased 98% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics increased by more than 100% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas increased 75% in 2021 due to a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression increased 82% in 2021 due to higher market share and market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.Net revenues for Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily due to increased volume and market share uptake since launch in 2020.Net revenues for Mavyret decreased 8% in 2021 primarily driven by the continued disruption of global HCV markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Gross MarginPercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Gross margin$38,751 $30,417 $25,827 27 %18 %as a percent of net revenues69 %66 %78 %Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 increased from 2020 primarily due to lower amortization of inventory fair value step-up adjustment associated with the Allergan acquisition and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the Allergan acquisition.Selling, General and AdministrativePercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Selling, general and administrative$12,349 $11,299 $6,942 9 %63 %as a percent of net revenues22 %25 %21 %SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 decreased primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan as well as leverage from revenue growth and synergies realized in the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition.2021 Form 10-K | 40Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and DevelopmentPercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Research and development$7,084 $6,557 $6,407 8 %2 %as a percent of net revenues13 %14 %19 %Acquired in-process research and development$962 $1,198 $385 (20)%>100%R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to the increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized for the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan.Acquired IPR&D expenses represent initial costs to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million as a result of exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and a charge of $370 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO Inc. for the development and commercialization of RGX-314, an investigational gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense in 2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer.Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions)202120202019Interest expense$2,423 $2,454 $1,784 Interest income(39)(174)(275)Interest expense, net$2,384 $2,280 $1,509 Net foreign exchange loss$51 $71 $42 Other expense, net2,500 5,614 3,006 Interest expense in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s floating rate debt obligations and deleveraging, partially offset by a higher average debt balance associated with the incremental Allergan debt acquired.Interest income in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $2.7 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in 2020. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2021, the change in fair value included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results.41 | 2021 Form 10-KIncome Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 11% in 2021, negative 36% in 2020 and 6% in 2019. The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESyears ended December 31 (in millions)202120202019Cash flows provided by (used in)Operating activities$22,777 $17,588 $13,324 Investing activities(2,344)(37,557)596 Financing activities(19,039)(11,501)18,708 Operating cash flows in 2021 increased from 2020. Operating cash flows in 2021 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and lower acquisition-related cash expenses, partially offset by higher income tax payments and the timing of working capital cash flows. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $376 million in 2021 and $367 million in 2020.Investing cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million. Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million.Financing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and €750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes. Financing cash flows also included the May 2021 repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes and the November 2021 repayment of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of €700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020.The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.2021 Form 10-K | 42 No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityAbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsThere were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.Future Cash RequirementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:(in millions)TotalCurrentLong-termLong-term debt, including current portion$75,962 $12,428 $63,534 Interest on long-term debt(a)30,002 2,392 27,610 Contingent consideration liabilities(b)14,887 1,249 13,638 (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt.

The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021.43 | 2021 Form 10-K(b)Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements.Income TaxesFuture income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and is payable in five future annual installments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.Quarterly Cash DividendOn October 29, 2021, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.Collaborations, Licensing and Other ArrangementsAbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. 2021 Form 10-K | 44Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, $27.0 billion in 2020 and $18.8 billion in 2019. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.The following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 95% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare RebatesManaged Care RebatesWholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2018$1,645 $1,439 $656 Provisions4,035 5,772 7,947 Payments(3,915)(5,275)(7,917)Balance at December 31, 20191,765 1,936 686 Additions(a)1,266 649 71 Provisions6,715 8,656 8,677 Payments(6,801)(8,334)(8,693)Balance at December 31, 20202,945 2,907 741 Provisions9,622 11,306 11,286 Payments(8,751)(11,116)(11,125)Balance at December 31, 2021$3,816 $3,097 $902 (a)Represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition.Cash Discounts and Product ReturnsCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $3.6 billion in 2021, $2.4 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.45 | 2021 Form 10-KThe discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2021. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021:50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)IncreaseDecreaseDefined benefit plansService and interest cost$(90)$100 Projected benefit obligation(1,014)1,159 Other post-employment plansService and interest cost$(7)$7 Projected benefit obligation(61)69 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by $101 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in 2021 Form 10-K | 46the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements.47 | 2021 Form 10-KITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020:20212020as of December 31 (in millions)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:Euro$10,253 1.155 $195 $7,818 1.213 $(39)Chinese yuan673 6.400 (1)247 6.584 (1)British pound605 1.331 9 275 1.341 3 Japanese yen602 113.3 9 837 103.9 (7)Canadian dollar571 1.258 9 591 1.328 (23)All other currencies1,549 n/a5 1,459n/a(14)Total$14,253 $226 $11,227 $(81)The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2021, the company has €5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $244 million at December 31, 2021. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2021. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2021 Form 10-K | 48",2023-12-30 16:57:28.414232
1551152,ABBV,AbbVie Inc.,2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" This section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWCompany OverviewAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees. 2022 Financial ResultsAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1 billion, operating earnings of $18.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.63 and cash flows from operations of $24.9 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics portfolios.Diluted earnings per share in 2022 was $6.63 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.8 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $2.0 billion for charges related to litigation matters; (iv) $766 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (v) $604 million related to intangible asset impairment. These costs were partially offset by an after-tax gain of $126 million related to the divestiture of Pylera and a benefit of $26 million related to certain tax items. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. As a result of the successful execution of the integration plan, AbbVie realized $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022.To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie incurred total cumulative charges of $2.3 billion through 2022. These costs consisted of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.2022 Form 10-K | 32 Recent Global EventsRussia/UkraineIn response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as certain non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions and export controls on Russia and Belarus. These include restrictions on the export and transfer of products containing certain toxins, including Botox, to Russia and Belarus. However, AbbVie is not prohibited to continue the sale of essential pharmaceutical products to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. In March 2022, AbbVie announced the suspension of operations for all aesthetics products in Russia. In April 2022, AbbVie also announced that all profits from the sales of essential medicines in Russia will be donated to support direct humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. While the company’s operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not significant, if the conflict escalates and results in broader economic and political concerns, AbbVie’s business could be adversely impacted.Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)In response to COVID-19, AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics.2023 Strategic ObjectivesAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:•Skyrizi and Rinvoq revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion.•Advancing our hematologic oncology portfolio by increasing Venclexta market share and new indications, strong commercial execution of new product launches and effectively managing market and competitive challenges impacting Imbruvica. •Continuing investment in the global expansion of aesthetics and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.•Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and Qulipta.•Maximizing AbbVie's existing eye care portfolio. •Effectively managing the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion. •The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2023. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7.33 | 2022 Form 10-K Research and DevelopmentResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.AbbVie's pipeline currently includes over 80 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.Significant Programs and DevelopmentsImmunologySkyrizi•In January 2022, AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. •In June 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease.•In November 2022, AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy.Rinvoq•In January 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease did not respond to previous treatment and is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or when use of other pills or injections is not recommended. •In February 2022, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 induction study, U-Excel, for Rinvoq in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy met the primary and most key secondary endpoints.•In March 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. •In April 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.•In May 2022, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from U-ENDURE, a Phase 3 maintenance study for Rinvoq in adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to a conventional or biologic therapy. The results showed that more patients treated with Rinvoq achieved the co-primary and secondary endpoints at one year compared to placebo.•In July 2022, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.•In July 2022, AbbVie announced its submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA and a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. •In July 2022, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).2022 Form 10-K | 34 •In October 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF blocker therapy.•In November 2022, AbbVie announced that the EMA's Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted an opinion following a review of the benefit-risk of medicines within the JAK inhibitor class for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including Rinvoq. Confirming the recommendation from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the CHMP did not recommend changes to the current Rinvoq indication statements and recommended updates to dosage and special warnings for all JAK inhibitor products indicated for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. These recommendations will be forwarded to the EC, which is expected to issue a final decision.

This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended (dollars in millions)2022202120202022202120222021United States$45,713 $43,510 $34,879 5.1 %24.7 %5.1 %24.7 %International12,341 12,687 10,925 (2.7)%16.1 %5.5 %12.6 %Net revenues$58,054 $56,197 $45,804 3.3 %22.7 %5.1 %21.9 %37 | 2022 Form 10-K The following table details AbbVie's worldwide net revenues:Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2022202120202022202120222021ImmunologyHumiraUnited States$18,619 $17,330 $16,112 7.4 %7.6 %7.4 %7.6 %International2,618 3,364 3,720 (22.2)%(9.6)%(14.9)%(12.8)%Total$21,237 $20,694 $19,832 2.6 %4.3 %3.8 %3.7 %SkyriziUnited States$4,484 $2,486 $1,385 80.4 %79.6 %80.4 %79.6 %International681 453 205 50.4 %>100.0 %67.1 %>100.0 %Total$5,165 $2,939 $1,590 75.7 %84.9 %78.3 %84.0 %RinvoqUnited States$1,794 $1,271 $653 41.2 %94.8 %41.2 %94.8 %International728 380 78 91.4 %>100.0 %>100.0 %>100.0 %Total$2,522 $1,651 $731 52.8 %>100.0 %58.1 %>100.0 %Hematologic OncologyImbruvicaUnited States$3,426 $4,321 $4,305 (20.7)%0.4 %(20.7)%0.4 %Collaboration revenues1,142 1,087 1,009 5.1 %7.7 %5.1 %7.7 %Total$4,568 $5,408 $5,314 (15.5)%1.8 %(15.5)%1.8 %VenclextaUnited States$1,009 $934 $804 8.0 %16.1 %8.0 %16.1 %International1,000 886 533 12.9 %66.2 %24.6 %60.9 %Total$2,009 $1,820 $1,337 10.4 %36.1 %16.1 %34.0 %AestheticsBotox Cosmetic (a)United States$1,654 $1,424 $687 16.2 %>100.0 %16.2 %>100.0 %International961 808 425 18.9 %90.0 %28.8 %83.9 %Total$2,615 $2,232 $1,112 17.2 %>100.0 %20.8 %98.4 %Juvederm Collection (a)United States$548 $658 $318 (16.7)%>100.0 %(16.7)%>100.0 %International880 877 400 0.3 %>100.0 %8.9 %>100.0 %Total$1,428 $1,535 $718 (7.0)%>100.0 %(2.1)%>100.0 %Other Aesthetics (a)United States$1,122 $1,268 $666 (11.5)%90.2 %(11.5)%90.2 %International168 198 94 (14.9)%>100.0 %(8.3)%>100.0 %Total$1,290 $1,466 $760 (12.0)%93.0 %(11.1)%91.9 %NeuroscienceBotox Therapeutic (a)United States$2,255 $2,012 $1,155 12.1 %74.3 %12.1 %74.3 %International464 439 232 5.6 %89.0 %15.3 %78.8 %Total$2,719 $2,451 $1,387 10.9 %76.7 %12.6 %75.0 %Vraylar (a)United States$2,037 $1,728 $951 17.9 %81.7 %17.9 %81.7 %International1 — — n/mn/mn/mn/mTotal$2,038 $1,728 $951 17.9 %81.7 %17.9 %81.7 %DuodopaUnited States$95 $102 $103 (6.7)%(1.0)%(6.7)%(1.0)%International363 409 391 (11.3)%4.6 %(0.8)%(0.1)%Total$458 $511 $494 (10.4)%3.4 %(2.0)%(0.3)%Ubrelvy (a)United States$680 $552 $125 23.2 %>100.0 %23.2 %>100.0 %QuliptaUnited States$158 $— $— >100.0 %n/m>100.0 %n/mOther Neuroscience (a)United States$456 $667 $528 (30.5)%26.3 %(30.5)%26.3 %International19 18 11 4.8 %77.4 %9.0 %64.7 %Total$475 $685 $539 (29.6)%27.2 %(29.5)%27.0 %2022 Form 10-K | 38 Percent changeAt actual currency ratesAt constant currency ratesyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)2022202120202022202120222021Eye CareLumigan/Ganfort (a)United States$242 $273 $165 (11.0)%64.7 %(11.0)%64.7 %International272 306 213 (11.3)%44.1 %(3.0)%38.1 %Total$514 $579 $378 (11.2)%53.1 %(6.8)%49.7 %Alphagan/Combigan (a)United States$202 $373 $223 (45.8)%66.5 %(45.8)%66.5 %International144 156 103 (7.9)%52.5 %2.5 %50.6 %Total$346 $529 $326 (34.6)%62.1 %(31.5)%61.5 %Restasis (a)United States$621 $1,234 $755 (49.6)%63.3 %(49.6)%63.3 %International45 56 32 (20.2)%75.3 %(13.8)%80.1 %Total$666 $1,290 $787 (48.3)%63.8 %(48.0)%64.0 %Other Eye Care (a)United States$538 $523 $305 2.3 %72.7 %2.3 %72.7 %International637 646 388 (1.2)%66.1 %8.7 %61.0 %Total$1,175 $1,169 $693 0.4 %69.0 %5.9 %66.1 %Other Key ProductsMavyretUnited States$755 $754 $785 0.2 %(4.0)%0.2 %(4.0)%International786 956 1,045 (17.8)%(8.5)%(8.5)%(10.8)%Total$1,541 $1,710 $1,830 (9.9)%(6.5)%(4.7)%(7.8)%CreonUnited States$1,278 $1,191 $1,114 7.3 %6.9 %7.3 %6.9 %Linzess/Constella (a)United States$1,003 $1,006 $649 (0.4)%55.1 %(0.4)%55.1 %International32 32 18 0.3 %77.3 %7.6 %66.4 %Total$1,035 $1,038 $667 (0.3)%55.7 %(0.1)%55.4 %All other$4,137 $5,019 $5,119 (17.6)%(2.0)%(16.3)%(2.8)%Total net revenues$58,054 $56,197 $45,804 3.3 %22.7 %5.1 %21.9 %n/m – Not meaningful(a)Net revenues include Allergan product revenues after the acquisition closing date of May 8, 2020.The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 7% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by a lower market share following the corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 15% in 2022 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition. On January 31, 2023, Humira lost exclusivity in the United States. Following this loss of exclusivity, AbbVie expects direct biosimilar competition and Humira net revenues to decline in the United States. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies to maintain broad formulary access of Humira and manage the impact of biosimilar erosion. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 78% in 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Skyrizi for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.Net revenues for Rinvoq increased 58% in 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased 16% in 2022 as a result of decreased market demand and lower market share in the United States. The decrease in net revenues was also partially offset by increased collaboration revenues.Net revenues for Venclexta increased 16% in 2022 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with CLL and acute myeloid leukemia.39 | 2022 Form 10-K Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic increased 21% in 2022 due to sustained consumer demand in the United States, which was moderated in the second half of the year by economic pressures impacting consumer discretionary spending, and increased investment in key international markets.Net revenues for Juvederm Collection decreased 2% in 2022 due to economic pressures impacting consumer discretionary spending and increased pricing promotions to support the market. International net revenues increased by 9% due to increased investment in key markets, partially offset by the suspension of aesthetic operations in Russia and the impact of COVID-19 in China.Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic increased 13% in 2022 due to market growth.Net revenues for Vraylar increased 18% in 2022 due to higher market share and market growth.Net revenues for Ubrelvy increased 23% in 2022 primarily due to increased market share uptake since launch, partially offset by unfavorable pricing.Net revenues for Qulipta increased greater than 100% in 2022 due to strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine in adults. Net revenues for Mavyret decreased 5% in 2022 due to the continued disruption of global hepatitis C virus markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Gross MarginPercent changeyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)20222021202020222021Gross margin$40,640 $38,751 $30,417 5 %27 %as a percent of net revenues70 %69 %66 %Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2022 increased compared to 2021.

R&D expense percentage for 2022 was favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized, the purchase of priority review vouchers from third parties in the prior year as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense represents upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in 2022 included a charge of $130 million related to acquiring Syndesi Therapeutics SA, charges related to other upfront payments totaling $315 million and development milestones of $252 million. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million related to exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, a charge of $370 million related to a collaboration 2022 Form 10-K | 40 agreement with REGENXBIO Inc, charges related to other upfront payments totaling $192 million and development milestones of $162 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other Operating Expense, NetOther operating expense, net in 2022 included a one-time charge of $229 million related to an asset divested as part of the Allergan acquisition, partially offset by $172 million of income related to the sale of worldwide commercial rights of a mature brand Pylera. Other operating expense, net in 2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico Life Sciences LLC collaboration. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other Non-Operating Expensesyears ended December 31 (in millions)202220212020Interest expense$2,230 $2,423 $2,454 Interest income(186)(39)(174)Interest expense, net$2,044 $2,384 $2,280 Net foreign exchange loss$148 $51 $71 Other expense, net2,448 2,500 5,614 Interest expense in 2022 decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to a lower average debt balance as a result of deleveraging, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates.Interest income in 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates.Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $2.8 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2021, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates.Income Tax ExpenseThe effective income tax rate was 12% in 2022, 11% in 2021 and negative 36% in 2020. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico tax credits relate to excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the “Puerto Rico Act”) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $323 million.FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions)202220212020Cash flows provided by (used in)Operating activities$24,943 $22,777 $17,588 Investing activities(623)(2,344)(37,557)Financing activities(24,803)(19,039)(11,501)Operating cash flows in 2022 increased from 2021 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and lower income tax payments, partially offset by the timing of working capital.

Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021.Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $10.0 billion in 2022 and $9.3 billion in 2021. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate.The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $1.1 billion in 2022 and 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization.No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2022 or 2021 and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.Credit RiskAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit RatingsCredit FacilityAbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.2022 Form 10-K | 42 Access to CapitalThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.Credit RatingsIn 2022, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded AbbVie's senior unsecured long-term credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2, affirmed its Prime-2 short-term credit rating and revised its outlook to positive from stable. In addition, Standard and Poor's Global Ratings revised its outlook to positive from stable and affirmed its long-term issuer credit rating of BBB+.Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.Future Cash RequirementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022:(in millions)TotalCurrentLong-termLong-term debt, including current portion$63,128 $4,132 $58,996 Interest on long-term debt(a)28,445 2,363 26,082 Contingent consideration liabilities(b)16,384 1,469 14,915 (a)Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2022. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022.(b)Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements.Income TaxesFuture income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and is payable in four future annual installments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.Quarterly Cash DividendOn October 28, 2022, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of January 13, 2023. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.0% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, 43 | 2022 Form 10-K declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.Collaborations, Licensing and Other ArrangementsAbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $41.4 billion in 2022, $33.9 billion in 2021 and $27.0 billion in 2020. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.2022 Form 10-K | 44 The following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2022. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.(in millions)Medicaid and Medicare RebatesManaged Care RebatesWholesalerChargebacksBalance at December 31, 2019$1,765 $1,936 $686 Additions(a)1,266 649 71 Provisions6,715 8,656 8,677 Payments(6,801)(8,334)(8,693)Balance at December 31, 20202,945 2,907 741 Provisions9,622 11,306 11,286 Payments(8,751)(11,116)(11,125)Balance at December 31, 20213,816 3,097 902 Provisions11,713 14,119 13,070 Payments(10,331)(12,974)(12,829)Balance at December 31, 2022$5,198 $4,242 $1,143 (a)Represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition.Other AllowancesOther allowances include cash discounts, product returns, sales incentives, and other adjustments, which are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. Reserves for cash discounts and sales incentives are readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Cash discounts totaled $1.8 billion in 2022, $1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. Allowances other than cash discounts are not significant.Pension and Other Post-Employment BenefitsAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. 45 | 2022 Form 10-K AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2022. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2023 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022:50 basis point(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)IncreaseDecreaseDefined benefit plansNet periodic benefit cost$(34)$57 Projected benefit obligation(612)687 Other post-employment plansNet periodic benefit cost$(5)$6 Projected benefit obligation(44)49 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2022 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2023. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2023 by $98 million.The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2022 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2023. Income TaxesAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.LitigationThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative 2022 Form 10-K | 46 future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.47 | 2022 Form 10-K ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.Foreign Currency RiskAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021:20222021as of December 31 (in millions)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Contract amountWeighted average exchange rateFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:Euro$8,507 1.071 $9 $10,253 1.155 $195 Canadian dollar1,302 1.312 40 571 1.258 9 British pound772 1.234 (8)605 1.331 9 Chinese yuan596 7.024 (5)673 6.400 (1)Japanese yen567 133.3 (3)602 113.3 9 All other currencies1,954 n/a(2)1,549 n/a5 Total$13,698 $31 $14,253 $226 The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2022, the company has €5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate RiskThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $155 million at December 31, 2022. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $4.2 billion at December 31, 2022. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2022 Form 10-K | 48",2023-12-30 16:57:26.645057
