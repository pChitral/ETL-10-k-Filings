64803,CVS,CVS HEALTH Corp,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (“MD&A”) The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this 10-K, “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements” in this 10-K.Overview of BusinessCVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is the nation’s premier health innovation company helping people on their path to better health. Whether in one of its pharmacies or through its health services and plans, CVS Health is pioneering a bold new approach to total health by making quality care more affordable, accessible, simple and seamless. CVS Health is community-based and locally focused, engaging consumers with the care they need when and where they need it. The Company has approximately 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 105 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year and expanding specialty pharmacy services. CVS Health also serves an estimated 37 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.On November 28, 2018 (the “Aetna Acquisition Date”), the Company acquired Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”) for a combination of cash and CVS Health stock (the “Aetna Acquisition”). The Company acquired Aetna to help improve the consumer health care experience by combining Aetna’s health care benefits products and services with CVS Health’s retail locations, walk-in medical clinics and integrated pharmacy capabilities with the goal of becoming the new, trusted front door to health care. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Aetna shareholders received $145.00 in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. The transaction valued Aetna at approximately $212 per share or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna’s debt, the total value of the transaction was approximately $78 billion. The Company financed the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and by issuing approximately $45 billion of new debt, including senior notes and term loans (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this MD&A). The consolidated financial statements reflect Aetna’s results subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date.On October 10, 2018, the Company and Aetna entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) that allowed the Company’s proposed acquisition of Aetna to proceed, provided Aetna agreed to sell its individual standalone PDPs. As part of the agreement reached with the DOJ, Aetna entered into a purchase agreement with a subsidiary of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (“WellCare”) for the divestiture of Aetna’s standalone PDPs effective December 31, 2018. On November 30, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Aetna’s standalone PDPs. The Company provided administrative services to, and retained the financial results of, the divested plans through 2019. Subsequent to 2019, the Company will no longer retain the financial results of the divested plans. Aetna’s standalone PDPs had an aggregate of 2.5 million members as of December 31, 2019. As a result of the Aetna Acquisition, the Company added the Health Care Benefits segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, the Company realigned the composition of its segments to correspond with changes to its operating model and reflect how its Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) reviews information and manages the business. As a result of this realignment, the Company’s SilverScript® PDP moved from the Pharmacy Services segment to the Health Care Benefits segment. In addition, the Company moved Aetna’s mail order and specialty pharmacy operations from the Health Care Benefits segment to the Pharmacy Services segment. Segment financial information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes. See Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for segment financial information.The Company has four reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, Health Care Benefits and Corporate/Other, which are described below.58Overview of the Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on public health insurance exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s PBM filled or managed 2.0 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis.Overview of the Retail/LTC SegmentThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products, cosmetics and personal care products, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic® walk-in medical clinics and conducts long-term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2019, the Retail/LTC segment operated approximately 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 MinuteClinic® locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and onsite pharmacies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Retail/LTC segment filled 1.4 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company dispensed approximately 26.6% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Health Care Benefits SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segment is one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated 37 million people as of December 31, 2019. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services, workers’ compensation administrative services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” For periods prior to November 28, 2018 (the Aetna Acquisition Date), the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business.Overview of the Corporate/Other SegmentThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which consists of:•Management and administrative expenses to support the overall operations of the Company, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and Enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and •Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.59Results of OperationsThe following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018. For discussion of the Company’s results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with Retrospective Application of Segments” for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was revised to reflect the Company’s segment realignment and is included in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 8, 2019.Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Change Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017In millions2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Revenues: Products$185,236 $183,910 $180,063 $1,326 0.7 % $3,847 2.1 %Premiums63,122 8,184 3,558 54,938 671.3 % 4,626 130.0 %Services7,407 1,825 1,144 5,582 305.9 % 681 59.5 %Net investment income1,011 660 21 351 53.2 % 639 3,042.9 %Total revenues256,776 194,579 184,786 62,197 32.0 % 9,793 5.3 %Operating costs: Cost of products sold158,719 156,447 153,448 2,272 1.5 % 2,999 2.0 %Benefit costs52,529 6,594 2,810 45,935 696.6 % 3,784 134.7 %Goodwill impairments— 6,149 181 (6,149) (100.0)% 5,968 3,297.2 %Operating expenses33,541 21,368 18,809 12,173 57.0 % 2,559 13.6 %Total operating costs244,789 190,558 175,248 54,231 28.5 % 15,310 8.7 %Operating income11,987 4,021 9,538 7,966 198.1 % (5,517) (57.8)%Interest expense3,035 2,619 1,062 416 15.9 % 1,557 146.6 %Loss on early extinguishment of debt79 — — 79 100.0 % — — %Other expense (income)(124) (4) 208 (120) (3,000.0)% (212) (101.9)%Income before income tax provision8,997 1,406 8,268 7,591 539.9 % (6,862) (83.0)%Income tax provision2,366 2,002 1,637 364 18.2 % 365 22.3 %Income (loss) from continuing operations6,631 (596) 6,631 7,227 1,212.6 % (7,227) (109.0)%Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — (8) — — % 8 100.0 %Net income (loss)6,631 (596) 6,623 7,227 1,212.6 % (7,219) (109.0)%Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests3 2 (1) 1 50.0 % 3 300.0 %Net income (loss) attributable to CVS Health$6,634 $(594) $6,622 $7,228 1,216.8 % $(7,216) (109.0)%Commentary - 2019 compared to 2018Revenues•Total revenues increased $62.2 billion or 32.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to the impact of the Aetna Acquisition (primarily reflected in the Health Care Benefits segment) which occurred in November 2018, a 5.0% increase in Pharmacy Services segment revenue and a 3.1% increase in Retail/LTC segment revenue.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses•Operating expenses increased $12.2 billion or 57.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 13.1% in 2019, an increase of 210 basis points compared to 2018. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the impact of the Aetna Acquisition (including intangible asset amortization) and higher operating 60expenses in the Retail/LTC segment, including $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Drogaria Onofre Ltda. (“Onofre”), both recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019. •Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income •Operating income increased $8.0 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to (i) the absence of the $6.1 billion of pre-tax goodwill impairment charges related to the LTC reporting unit recorded within the Retail/LTC segment in 2018, (ii) the impact of the Aetna Acquisition and (iii) increased prescription volume and improved purchasing economics in the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments. The increase was partially offset by:•Continued reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC segment;•Continued price compression in the Pharmacy Services segment;•An increase in intangible asset amortization primarily related to the Aetna Acquisition;•Higher operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment, including $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre; and•The absence of $536 million in interest income on the proceeds from the financing for the Aetna Acquisition recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating income of the Company’s segments.Interest expense•Interest expense increased $416 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to financing activity associated with the Aetna Acquisition and the assumption of Aetna’s debt as of the Aetna Acquisition Date. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt•During 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in August 2019, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Other income•Other income increased $120 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Other income represents pension plan asset returns in excess of interest cost on pension plan obligations. The increase in other income in 2019 was primarily due to 2019 including a full year of income associated with the Aetna pension plan, as compared to 2018 which only included the Aetna pension plan income for the period subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date. Income tax provision•The Company’s effective income tax rate was 26.3% in 2019 compared to 142.4% in 2018. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the absence of the $6.1 billion of pre-tax goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2018, the majority of which were not deductible for income tax purposes.Loss from discontinued operations•In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens ‘n Things, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and Bob’s Stores, which filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The Company’s loss from discontinued operations primarily includes lease-related costs required to satisfy its Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores lease guarantees. •See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ and “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about the Company’s discontinued operations and the Company’s lease guarantees, respectively. 61Outlook for 2020 With respect to 2020, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:•The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from continued improvements in purchasing economics and Enterprise modernization, partially offset by net selling season losses during 2020 and continued price compression.•The Retail/LTC segment is expected to benefit from projected adjusted script growth driven by the continued successful execution of patient care programs, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure.•The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Government Services membership growth including projected above-industry growth in its Medicare Advantage products and new Medicaid contract wins, as well as integration synergies that will continue to disproportionately benefit the Health Care Benefits segment. •The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) imposes a significant industry-wide fee known as the Health Insurer Fee (the “HIF”). The HIF is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes and is allocated to insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer’s net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to the amount of health insurance premium for all U.S. health risk for certain lines of business during the preceding calendar year. The HIF was suspended for 2019, will be $15.5 billion for 2020 and has been repealed for calendar years after 2020. While the Company expects the reintroduction of the HIF to result in a lower medical benefit ratio (“MBR”) in 2020 compared to 2019, all else being equal, the Company expects its 2020 consolidated net income will be negatively impacted due to an increase in its effective income tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the non-deductibility of the HIF.•The Company believes that it is on track to achieve its 2020 target of $800-900 million of synergies from the Aetna Acquisition.•The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue for the next several years as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern the Company’s businesses.The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.62Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating segments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. Segment financial information has been retrospectively adjusted to conform with the current period presentation. See the reconciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.Effective for the first quarter of 2019, the Company realigned the composition of its segments to correspond with changes to its operating model and reflect how the CODM reviews information and manages the business. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for further discussion of this realignment. Segment financial information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes. The following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:In millionsPharmacyServices (1) Retail/LTC Health CareBenefits Corporate/Other IntersegmentEliminations (2) ConsolidatedTotals2019 Total revenues $141,491 $86,608 $69,604 $512 $(41,439) $256,776Adjusted operating income (loss)5,129 6,705 5,202 (1,000) (697) 15,3392018 Total revenues134,736 83,989 8,962 606 (33,714) 194,579Adjusted operating income (loss)4,955 7,403 528 (856) (769) 11,2612017 Total revenues130,822 79,398 3,587 16 (29,037) 184,786Adjusted operating income (loss)4,628 7,475 359 (896) (741) 10,825_____________________________________________ (1)Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $11.5 billion, $11.4 billion and $10.8 billion of retail co-payments for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about retail co-payments.(2)Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services segment, the Retail/LTC segment and/or the Health Care Benefits segment. 63The following is a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2019In millionsPharmacy Services Retail/LTC Health CareBenefits Corporate/Other IntersegmentEliminations ConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$4,735 $5,793 $3,639 $(1,483) $(697) $11,987Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets (1)394 476 1,563 3 — 2,436Acquisition-related integration costs (2)— — — 480 — 480Store rationalization charges (3)— 231 — — — 231Loss on divestiture of subsidiary (4)— 205 — — — 205Adjusted operating income (loss)$5,129 $6,705 $5,202 $(1,000) $(697) $15,339 Year Ended December 31, 2018In millionsPharmacy Services Retail/LTC Health CareBenefits Corporate/Other IntersegmentEliminations ConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$4,607 $620 $368 $(805) $(769) $4,021Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets (1)348 498 160 — — 1,006Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (2)— 7 — 485 — 492Loss on divestiture of subsidiary (4)— 86 — — — 86Goodwill impairments (5)— 6,149 — — — 6,149Impairment of long-lived assets (6)— 43 — — — 43Interest income on financing for the Aetna Acquisition (7)— — — (536) — (536)Adjusted operating income (loss)$4,955 $7,403 $528 $(856) $(769) $11,26164 Year Ended December 31, 2017In millionsPharmacy Services Retail/LTC Health CareBenefits Corporate/Other IntersegmentEliminations ConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$4,300 $6,558 $357 $(936) $(741) $9,538Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets (1)328 487 2 — — 817Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (2)— 34 — 31 — 65Store rationalization charges (3)— 215 — — — 215Loss on divestiture of subsidiary (4)— — — 9 — 9Goodwill impairments (5)— 181 — — — 181Adjusted operating income (loss)$4,628 $7,475 $359 $(896) $(741) $10,825_____________________________________________ (1)The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. (2)In 2019, 2018 and 2017, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. In 2018 and 2017, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs also relate to the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. (“Omnicare”). The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment and the Retail/LTC segment. (3)In 2019, the store rationalization charges relate to the planned closure of 46 underperforming retail pharmacy stores during the second quarter of 2019 and the planned closure of 22 underperforming retail pharmacy stores during the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, the store rationalization charges primarily relate to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges and are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment. In 2017, the store rationalization charges related to the Company’s enterprise streamlining initiative and are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment. (4)In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s RxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. In 2017, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents transaction costs associated with the sale of RxCrossroads. The loss on divestiture of subsidiary costs are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment and Corporate/Other segment. (5)In 2018, the goodwill impairments relate to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. In 2017, the goodwill impairments relate to the RxCrossroads reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. (6)In 2018, impairment of long-lived assets primarily relates to the impairment of property and equipment within the Retail/LTC segment and is reflected in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. (7)In 2018, the Company recorded interest income of $536 million on the proceeds of the $40 billion of unsecured senior notes it issued in March 2018 to partially fund the Aetna Acquisition. All amounts are for the periods prior to the close of the Aetna Acquisition, which occurred on November 28, 2018, and were recorded within the Corporate/Other segment.65Pharmacy Services SegmentThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance for the respective periods: Change Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017In millions, except percentages2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Revenues: Products$140,946 $134,285 $130,578 $6,661 5.0% $3,707 2.8%Services545 451 244 94 20.8% 207 84.8%Total revenues141,491 134,736 130,822 6,755 5.0% 3,914 3.0%Cost of products sold135,245 128,777 125,273 6,468 5.0% 3,504 2.8%Operating expenses1,511 1,352 1,249 159 11.8% 103 8.2%Operating expenses as a % of total revenues1.1% 1.0% 1.0% Operating income$4,735 $4,607 $4,300 $128 2.8% $307 7.1%Operating income as a % of total revenues3.3% 3.4% 3.3% Adjusted operating income (1)$5,129 $4,955 $4,628 $174 3.5% $327 7.1%Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues3.6% 3.7% 3.5% Revenues (by distribution channel): Pharmacy network (2) (3)$88,755 $87,167 $84,677 $1,588 1.8% $2,490 2.9%Mail choice (3) (4)52,141 47,049 45,731 5,092 10.8% 1,318 2.9%Other595 520 414 75 14.4% 106 25.6%Pharmacy claims processed: (5) Total2,014.2 1,889.8 1,781.9 124.4 6.6% 107.9 6.1%Pharmacy network (2)1,704.0 1,601.4 1,516.7 102.6 6.4% 84.7 5.6%Mail choice (4)310.2 288.4 265.2 21.8 7.6% 23.2 8.7%Generic dispensing rate: (5) Total88.2% 87.3% 87.0% Pharmacy network (2)88.7% 87.9% 87.7% Mail choice (4)85.1% 83.9% 83.1% Mail choice penetration rate (4) (5)15.4% 15.3% 14.9% _____________________________________________ (1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy Services segment.(2)Pharmacy network revenues, pharmacy claims processed and generic dispensing rate do not include Maintenance Choice® activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Maintenance choice permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order.(3)Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. (4)Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail order facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect® claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as prescriptions filled at the Company’s retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice program.(5)Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.66Commentary - 2019 compared to 2018Revenues•Total revenues increased $6.8 billion, or 5.0%, to $141.5 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to brand inflation as well as increased total pharmacy claims volume, partially offset by continued price compression and an increased generic dispensing rate.•As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The Company’s mail choice claims processed, on a 30-day equivalent basis, increased 7.6% to 310.2 million claims in 2019 compared to 288.4 million claims in 2018. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.•During 2019, the average revenue per mail choice claim, on a 30-day equivalent basis, increased by 3.0% compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy claims processed.•The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed, on a 30-day equivalent basis, increased 6.4% to 1.7 billion claims in 2019 compared to 1.6 billion claims in 2018. The increase in the pharmacy network claim volume was primarily due to net new business, including the onboarding of Anthem, Inc.’s (“Anthem’s”) PBM, IngenioRx, during 2019.•During 2019, the average revenue per pharmacy network claim processed, on a 30-day equivalent basis, decreased 4.2% compared to 2018 as a result of continued price compression.•The segment’s total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.2% in 2019 compared to 87.3% in 2018. The continued increase in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily due to the impact of new generic drug introductions and the Company’s ongoing efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate. The Company believes its generic dispensing rate will continue to increase in future periods, albeit at a slower pace. This increase will be affected by, among other things, the number of new brand and generic drug introductions and the Company’s success at encouraging plan members to utilize generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate.Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization related to selling, general and administrative activities; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.•Operating expenses increased $159 million, or 11.8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to growth in the business, including operating expenses associated with Aetna’s mail order and specialty pharmacy operations (including intangible asset amortization) and investments related to the Company’s agreement with Anthem’s PBM, IngenioRx, during 2019.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 1.1% and 1.0% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating income and adjusted operating income•Operating income increased $128 million, or 2.8%, and adjusted operating income increased $174 million, or 3.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in both operating income and adjusted operating income was primarily driven by increased claims volume, the addition of Aetna’s mail order and specialty pharmacy operations and improved purchasing economics, partially offset by continued price compression. The increase in operating income also was partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization related to Aetna’s mail order and specialty pharmacy operations.•As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on operating income and adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company’s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends to continue. The “differential” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider. 67Retail/LTC SegmentThe following table summarizes the Retail/LTC segment’s performance for the respective periods: Change Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017In millions, except percentages2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Revenues: Products$85,729 $83,175 $78,522 $2,554 3.1 % $4,653 5.9 %Services879 814 876 65 8.0 % (62) (7.1)%Total revenues86,608 83,989 79,398 2,619 3.1 % 4,591 5.8 %Cost of products sold 62,688 59,906 56,066 2,782 4.6 % 3,840 6.8 %Goodwill impairments— 6,149 181 (6,149) (100.0)% 5,968 3,297.2 %Operating expenses18,127 17,314 16,593 813 4.7 % 721 4.3 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues20.9% 20.6% 20.9 % Operating income$5,793 $620 $6,558 $5,173 834.4 % $(5,938) (90.5)%Operating income as a % of total revenues6.7% 0.7% 8.3 % Adjusted operating income (1)$6,705 $7,403 $7,475 $(698) (9.4)% $(72) (1.0)%Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues7.7% 8.8% 9.4 % Revenues (by major goods/service lines): Pharmacy$66,442 $64,179 $59,528 $2,263 3.5 % $4,651 7.8 %Front Store19,422 19,055 18,769 367 1.9 % 286 1.5 %Other744 755 1,101 (11) (1.5)% (346) (31.4)%Prescriptions filled (2)1,417.2 1,339.1 1,230.5 78.1 5.8 % 108.6 8.8 %Revenues increase (decrease): Total3.1% 5.8% (2.1)% Pharmacy3.5% 7.8% (2.2)% Front Store1.9% 1.5% (1.9)% Total prescription volume increase (2)5.8% 8.8% 0.6 % Same store sales increase (decrease): (3) Total3.7% 6.0% (2.6)% Pharmacy4.5% 7.9% (2.6)% Front Store1.1% 0.5% (2.6)% Prescription volume (2)7.2% 9.1% 0.4 % Generic dispensing rate (2)88.3% 87.5% 87.3 % _____________________________________________ (1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Retail/LTC segment.(2)Includes an adjustment to convert 90‑day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30‑day prescriptions.

Commentary - 2019 compared to 2018Revenues •Total revenues increased approximately $2.6 billion, or 3.1%, to $86.6 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription volume and brand inflation, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increased generic dispensing rate.68•As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•Front store same store sales increased 1.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in front store sales in 2019 was primarily driven by increases in health and beauty product sales.•Pharmacy same store sales increased 4.5% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the 7.2% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volumes on a 30-day equivalent basis driven mainly by (i) continued adoption of patient care programs, (ii) collaborations with PBMs and (iii) the Company’s preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D networks.•Pharmacy revenue growth continues to be adversely affected by reimbursement pressure. Pharmacy revenue growth also continues to be adversely affected by the conversion of brand name drugs to equivalent generic drugs, which typically have a lower selling price. The segment’s generic dispensing rate grew to 88.3% in 2019 compared to 87.5% in 2018. •Pharmacy revenue growth also continues to be adversely affected by industry challenges in the LTC business, such as continuing lower occupancy rates at skilled nursing facilities, as well as the deteriorating financial health of many skilled nursing facilities. •Pharmacy revenue in 2019 continued to benefit from the Company’s ability to attract and retain managed care customers and the increased use of pharmaceuticals by an aging population as the first line of defense for health care.Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.•Operating expenses increased $813 million, or 4.7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the following:•Store rationalization charges of $231 million recorded in 2019 primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges in connection with the planned closure of underperforming retail pharmacy stores during the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020;•The $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019;•The increased prescription volume described above; and•The investment of a portion of the savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) in wages and benefits.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 20.9% in 2019 compared to 20.6% in 2018. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in operating expenses described above.Operating income and adjusted operating income•Operating income increased $5.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the absence of the $6.1 billion of pre-tax goodwill impairment charges related to the LTC reporting unit recorded in the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by the decrease in adjusted operating income described below, as well as the $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both recorded in 2019. •Adjusted operating income decreased $698 million, or 9.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to continued reimbursement pressure and increased operating expenses primarily driven by the investment of a portion of the savings from the TCJA in wages and benefits. The decrease was partially offset by increased prescription volume, an increased generic dispensing rate and improved purchasing economics.•As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The segment’s pharmacy operating income and adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able grow revenues, and its operating income and adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.•The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s operating income and adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand to generic drug conversions.69Health Care Benefits Segment For periods prior to November 28, 2018 (the Aetna Acquisition Date), the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business.

The increases were primarily due to the Aetna Acquisition. The increase in operating income was partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization related to the Aetna Acquisition.70The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s medical membership as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018In thousandsInsured ASC Total Insured ASC TotalMedical membership: Commercial3,591 14,159 17,750 3,871 13,888 17,759Medicare Advantage2,321 — 2,321 1,758 — 1,758Medicare Supplement881 — 881 793 — 793Medicaid1,398 558 1,956 1,128 663 1,791Total medical membership8,191 14,717 22,908 7,550 14,551 22,101 Supplemental membership information: Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (standalone) (1) 5,994 6,134_____________________________________________ (1)Represents the Company’s SilverScript PDP membership only.

The Company retained the financial results of the divested plans through 2019 through a reinsurance agreement. Subsequent to 2019, the Company will no longer retain the financial results of the divested plans.Medical MembershipMedical membership as of December 31, 2019 increased compared with December 31, 2018, reflecting increases in Medicare, Commercial ASC and Medicaid products, partially offset by declines in Commercial Insured products.Medicare UpdateOn April 1, 2019, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its final notice detailing final 2020 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates (the “Final Notice”). Overall the Company projects the benchmark rates in the Final Notice will increase funding for its Medicare Advantage business, excluding the impact of the health insurer fee, by approximately 2.0% in 2020 compared to 2019.The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company’s 2020 star ratings in October 2019. The Company’s 2020 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2021. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2019, 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2020 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 79% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2019 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2018.Corporate/Other SegmentCommentary - 2019 compared to 2018Revenues•Total revenues decreased $94 million in 2019 compared to 2018. •In 2019, revenues relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, that were acquired in the Aetna Acquisition. Revenues in 2019 include $104 million of net realized capital gains, primarily related to the sale of debt securities and other invested assets that support these insurance products. In 2018, revenues relate to interest income on the proceeds from the financing of the Aetna Acquisition.Operating expenses•Operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment include certain aspects of costs related to executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and Enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. After the Aetna Acquisition Date, such operating expenses also include operating costs to support the large case pensions and long-term care insurance products acquired in the Aetna Acquisition.71•Operating expenses increased $321 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the business, incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s investments in transformation and Enterprise modernization, legal costs and a $30 million charitable contribution to the CVS Health Foundation in 2019.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsThe Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, sale-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $1.7 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.The net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Change Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017In millions2019 2018 2017 $ % $ %Net cash provided by operating activities$12,848 $8,865 $8,007 $3,983 44.9 % $858 10.7 %Net cash used in investing activities(3,339) (43,285) (2,877) 39,946 (92.3)% (40,408) 1,404.5 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(7,850) 36,819 (6,751) (44,669) (121.3)% 43,570 (645.4)%Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash— (4) 1 4 (100.0)% (5) (500.0)%Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$1,659 $2,395 $(1,620) $(736) (30.7)% $4,015 (247.8)%Commentary - 2019 compared to 2018•Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $4.0 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the Aetna Acquisition as well as improvements in working capital, including the timing of certain payables and receipts. •Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $39.9 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to the Aetna Acquisition in November 2018. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the $725 million in proceeds from the sale of RxCrossroads in 2018 and net purchases of investments in 2019 compared to net sales of investments in 2018. •Net cash used in financing activities was $7.9 billion in 2019 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $36.8 billion in 2018. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily related to long-term borrowings during 2018 to partially fund the Aetna Acquisition, as well as debt repayments during 2019 including (i) the repayment of $4.0 billion of outstanding senior notes pursuant to tender offers for such outstanding senior notes, (ii) the repayment of the remaining $3.0 billion of the term loan used to partially fund the Aetna Acquisition and (iii) the repayment of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes upon maturity. The decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $3.5 billion of senior notes in 2019.72Included in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was the following store development activity: (1) 2019 2018 2017Total stores (beginning of year)9,967 9,846 9,750New and acquired stores (2)102 148 179Closed stores (2)(128) (27) (83)Total stores (end of year)9,941 9,967 9,846Relocated stores (2)23 34 30_____________________________________________ (1)Includes retail drugstores, certain onsite pharmacy stores, retail specialty pharmacy stores and pharmacies within Target stores.(2)Relocated stores are not included in new and acquired stores or closed stores totals.Short-term BorrowingsCommercial Paper and Back-up Credit FacilitiesThe Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The Company had $720 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.8% as of December 31, 2018. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 14, 2020, a $1.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 18, 2022, a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 17, 2023 and a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2024. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately .03%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company’s back-up credit facilities.Bridge Loan FacilityOn December 3, 2017, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company entered into a $49.0 billion unsecured bridge loan facility commitment. The Company paid $221 million in fees upon entering into the agreement. The fees were capitalized in other current assets and were amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge loan facility commitment was outstanding. The bridge loan facility commitment was reduced to $44.0 billion on December 15, 2017 upon the Company entering into a $5.0 billion term loan agreement. The Company recorded $56 million of amortization of the bridge loan facility fees during the year ended December 31, 2017, which was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.On March 9, 2018, the Company issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 billion (see “Long-term Borrowings - 2018 Notes” below). At that time, the bridge loan facility commitment was reduced to $4.0 billion, and the Company paid $8 million in fees to retain the bridge loan facility commitment through the Aetna Acquisition Date. Those fees were capitalized in other current assets and were amortized as interest expense over the period the bridge loan facility commitment was outstanding. The Company recorded $173 million of amortization of the bridge loan facility commitment fees during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a $4.0 billion unsecured 364-day bridge term loan agreement to formalize the bridge loan facility discussed above. On November 28, 2018, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the $4.0 billion unsecured 364-day bridge term loan agreement terminated.Federal Home Loan Bank of BostonSince the Aetna Acquisition Date, a subsidiary of the Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLBB”). As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $850 million. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB.Long-term Borrowings2019 NotesOn August 15, 2019, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.625% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2024, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2026 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2029 (collectively, the “2019 Notes”) for total 73proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of the 2019 Notes were used to repay certain of the Company’s outstanding debt.Beginning in July 2019, the Company entered into several interest rate swap and treasury lock transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of the 2019 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company paid a net amount of $25 million to the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a loss, net of tax, of $18 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as interest expense over the life of the 2019 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Early Extinguishment of DebtIn August 2019, the Company purchased $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $1.3 billion of its 3.125% senior notes due 2020, $723 million of its floating rate notes due 2020, $328 million of its 4.125% senior notes due 2021, $297 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 issued by Aetna, $413 million of 5.45% senior notes due 2021 issued by Coventry Health Care, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, and $962 million of its 3.35% senior notes due 2021. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $76 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, incurred $8 million in fees and recognized a net gain of $5 million on the write-off of net unamortized deferred financing premiums, for a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. 2018 NotesOn March 9, 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of $40.0 billion in principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes and unsecured fixed rate senior notes (collectively the “2018 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $39.4 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of the 2018 Notes were used to fund a portion of the Aetna Acquisition. The 2018 Notes consisted of the following at the time of issuance:In millions 3.125% senior notes due March 2020$2,000Floating rate notes due March 20201,0003.35% senior notes due March 20213,000Floating rate notes due March 20211,0003.7% senior notes due March 20236,0004.1% senior notes due March 20255,0004.3% senior notes due March 20289,0004.78% senior notes due March 20385,0005.05% senior notes due March 20488,000Total debt principal$40,000From December 2017 through March 2018, the Company entered into several interest rate swap and treasury lock transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of long-term debt to fund the Aetna Acquisition. In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. In connection with the hedge transactions, the Company received a net amount of $446 million from the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a gain, net of tax, of $331 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the 2018 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Term Loan AgreementOn December 15, 2017, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company entered into a $5.0 billion term loan agreement. The term loan agreement allowed for borrowings at various rates that were dependent, in part, on the Company’s debt ratings. In connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company borrowed $5.0 billion (a $3.0 billion three-year tranche and a $2.0 billion five-year tranche) under the term loan agreement in November 2018. The Company terminated the $2.0 billion five-year tranche in December 2018 with the repayment of the borrowing. The Company made principal payments of 74$500 million in March 2019, $1.0 billion in May 2019 and $1.5 billion in July 2019 on the three-year tranche, and terminated the three-year tranche and the term loan agreement with the final repayment of the borrowing in July 2019, at which time the Company had repaid all term loans. Aetna Related DebtUpon the closing of the Aetna Acquisition, the Company assumed long-term debt with a fair value of $8.1 billion, with stated interest rates ranging from 2.2% to 6.75%. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ and Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. Debt CovenantsThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s long-term debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), and its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. In December 2017, subsequent to the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Aetna, Moody’s changed the outlook on the Company’s long-term debt to “Under Review” from “Stable.” Similarly, S&P placed the Company’s long-term debt outlook on “Watch Negative” from “Stable.” Upon the issuance of the 2018 Notes on March 9, 2018, S&P lowered its corporate credit rating on the Company’s long-term debt to “BBB” from “BBB+” and changed the outlook from “Watch Negative” to “Stable.” On November 27, 2018, S&P lowered its rating on the long-term debt of Aetna to “BBB” from “A.” On November 28, 2018, upon the completion of the Aetna Acquisition, Moody’s lowered its rating on CVS Health Corporation’s long-term debt to “Baa2” from “Baa1.” Additionally, Moody’s changed the outlook on CVS Health Corporation’s long-term debt to “Negative” from “Under Review” and changed the outlook on the long-term debt of Aetna to “Negative” from “Stable.” In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. Share Repurchase ProgramsDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. See Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for information about share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2017. Quarterly Cash DividendIn December 2016, CVS Health’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized an 18% increase in CVS Health’s quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.50 per share effective in 2017. This increase equated to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. During 2019 and 2018, CVS Health maintained its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company and expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share throughout 2020. Future dividends will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board. 75Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease obligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When the subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations.As of December 31, 2019, the Company guaranteed 79 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2030. Management believes the ultimate disposition of any of the remaining lease guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or future cash flows. See “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for further information regarding the Company’s guarantees of lease obligations.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes certain estimated future obligations by period under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2019. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at December 31, 2019 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to such operating and finance leases are reflected within the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities in the table above. Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings are reflected in the table above assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements.(2)Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2019.(3)Payments of other long-term liabilities exclude Separate Accounts liabilities of approximately $4.5 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business.(4)Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $807 million, $2.5 billion and $291 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.(5)Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $2.4 billion have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unrealized capital gains on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $83 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.76Restrictions on Certain PaymentsIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health as a holding company, since CVS Health is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’s debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. Under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2019, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $366 million in the aggregate. The Company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held investments of $537 million and $531 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency RegulationThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2019, the RBC Ratio of each of the Company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2019, at that date, each of the Company’s active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.77Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.Revenue RecognitionPharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Pharmacy Services segment:•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and performed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.Drug DiscountsThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end 78and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.GuaranteesThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC SegmentRetail PharmacyThe Company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other ProgramsThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare®, consists of two components, ExtraSavingsTM and ExtraBucks® Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. ExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.The Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass®, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Long-term CareRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of Long-term Care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated 79differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.Walk-In Medical ClinicsFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Health Care Benefits SegmentHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which reflect contracted rates per employee and the number of covered employees recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. The Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operating results.Premium RevenuePremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the ACA’s minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.Services RevenueServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of the following components:•ASC fees are received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.•Workers’ compensation administrative services consist of fee-based managed care services. Workers’ compensation administrative services revenue is recognized once the service is provided.Accounting for Medicare Part D Revenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.80Revenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Debt SecuritiesThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value is other-than-temporary. If a decline in the fair value of a debt security is considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis or carrying value of the debt security is written down. The write-down is then bifurcated into its credit and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is included in the Company’s net income (loss), and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss), unless the Company intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.Among the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself, whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole, and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment’s current and short-term prospects for recovery. For unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the Company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. If either case is true, the Company recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment, and the cost basis/carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that the facts and circumstances factored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.Vendor Allowances and Purchase DiscountsPharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC SegmentVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is 81satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.There have not been any material changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.InventoryInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The Company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $401 million as of December 31, 2019. Although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2019.Although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease LiabilitiesThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.82Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentRecoverability of Definite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges).The long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded store rationalization charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a $43 million long-lived asset impairment charge, primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment. There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2017. Recoverability of GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company’s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns. 2019 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4% and 9%, respectively.As of the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Company added the Health Care Benefits segment which included the Commercial Business reporting unit. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition. As a result, at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit was equal to its carrying value. Given the close proximity of the Aetna Acquisition Date to the 2019 annual impairment test of goodwill, as expected, the fair 83value of the Commercial Business reporting unit remained relatively in line with the carrying value of the reporting unit. In addition, this fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in the revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate.Although the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the LTC reporting unit in the third quarter of 2019 were reasonable and achievable, the LTC reporting unit may continue to face challenges that may affect the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges and some of the key assumptions included in the Company’s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of the LTC reporting unit include client retention rates; occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities; the financial health of skilled nursing facility customers; facility reimbursement pressures; the Company’s ability to execute its senior living initiative; the Company’s ability to make acquisitions and integrate those businesses into its LTC operations in an orderly manner; and the Company’s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit also is dependent on market multiples of peer group companies and the risk-free interest rate environment, which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow valuation method. If the Company does not achieve its forecasts, it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the LTC reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit was $431 million. 2018 Goodwill Impairment TestsAs discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2018, the LTC reporting unit continued to experience industry-wide challenges that impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare and when the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed. Those challenges included lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018, and continued facility reimbursement pressures. In June 2018, LTC management submitted its initial budget for 2019 and updated the 2018 annual forecast which showed a deterioration in the projected financial results for the remainder of 2018 and in 2019, which also caused management to update its long-term forecast beyond 2019. Based on these updated projections, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $3.9 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment tests showed that the fair values of the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair value of the LTC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 2%. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the LTC reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues, including one significant customer bankruptcy. Additionally, LTC management submitted an updated final budget for 2019 which showed significant additional deterioration in the projected financial results for 2019 compared to the analyses performed in the second and third quarters of 2018 primarily due to continued industry and operational challenges, which also caused management to make further updates to its long-term forecast beyond 2019. Based on these updated projections, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in an additional $2.2 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2018, the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. In addition to the lower financial projections, changes in risk-free interest rates and lower market multiples of peer group companies also contributed to the amount of the 2018 goodwill impairment charges. 2017 Goodwill Impairment TestsThe Company recorded $181 million in goodwill impairment charges in 2017 related to the RxCrossroads reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test showed that the fair values of the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair values of the LTC and RxCrossroads reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 1% and 6%, respectively. On January 2, 2018, the Company sold its RxCrossroads reporting unit to McKesson Corporation for $725 million.84Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.Health Care Costs PayableAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, 73% and 67% respectively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2019, the Company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2019 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 27 basis points higher than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $240 million in 2019, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2019. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 19 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $227 million pretax.Also during 2019, the Company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2019 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were approximately 3.2% lower than previously estimated during the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in a reduction of $284 million in 2019 in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2019, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 3.4% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $349 million pretax.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax 85authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. The Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.86Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk. Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality RiskThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.InvestmentsThe Company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2019 and 2018:In millions2019 2018Experience-rated products $1,100 $1,063Remaining products18,587 17,191Total investments$19,687 $18,254Investment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals. The debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 with approximately $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (of which 4% and 6% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, supported experience-rated products).At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held $333 million and $373 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing 2% of total investments at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA and AA- at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A+ and A- at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value is other-than-temporary. When a debt security is in an unrealized capital loss position, the Company monitors the duration and severity of the loss to determine if sufficient market recovery can occur within a reasonable period of time. If a decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary, the cost basis or carrying value of the debt security is written down. The write down is then bifurcated into its credit and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component 87is included in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss), unless the Company intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to its anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. Accounting for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See “Critical Accounting Policies - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information. Evaluation of Market Valuation RisksThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario and is approximately equal to the historical annual volatility of interest rate movements for intermediate-term available-for-sale debt securities) and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for domestic equity securities.Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates and an immediate decrease of 15% in the prices for domestic equity securities, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2019 is as follows:•The fair value of long-term debt would decline by approximately $4.5 billion ($5.7 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition. •The theoretical reduction in the fair value of investment securities partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $420 million ($530 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-rated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these securities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.Based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2019.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity RiskAs of each of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk is not material.88Evaluation of Operational RisksThe Company also faces certain operational risks, including risks related to information security, including cybersecurity. The Company and its vendors have experienced and continue to experience a variety of cyber attacks, and the Company and its vendors expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. Among other things, the Company and its vendors have experienced automated attempts to gain access to public facing networks, brute force, SYN flood and distributed denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, vulnerability scanning, ransomware attacks, spear-phishing campaigns, mass reconnaissance attempts, injection attempts, phishing, PHP injection and cross-site scripting. The Company also has seen an increase in attacks designed to obtain access to consumers’ accounts using illegally obtained demographic information. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2019. The Board and its Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.89Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:05:31.391199
64803,CVS,CVS HEALTH Corp,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (“MD&A”) The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this 10-K, “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K.Overview of BusinessCVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a diversified health services company united around a common purpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting people wherever they are and changing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 105 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year and expanding specialty pharmacy services. We also serve an estimated 34 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.On November 28, 2018 (the “Aetna Acquisition Date”), the Company acquired Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). As a result of the acquisition of Aetna (the “Aetna Acquisition”), the Company added the Health Care Benefits segment. Certain aspects of Aetna’s operations, including products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, are included in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment. The consolidated financial statements reflect Aetna’s results subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date. The Company has four reportable segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC, Health Care Benefits and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Overview of the Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, mail order pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on public health insurance exchanges and private health insurance exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.Overview of the Retail/LTC SegmentThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic® walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2020, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, approximately 1,100 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company dispensed approximately 27.1% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Health Care Benefits SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segment is one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits 66segment also provided workers’ compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’ Compensation business”) prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” For periods prior to the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’s SilverScript® PDP business.Overview of the Corporate/Other SegmentThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and•Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.67COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. Beginning in March 2020, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to emerge in the U.S. The Company executed preparedness plans to maintain continuity of its operations, including transitioning many office-based colleagues to a remote work environment and installing protective equipment in our retail pharmacies. The Company also provided enhanced benefits to its colleagues, including bonuses to frontline colleagues, dependent care financial assistance, paid sick leave for part-time colleagues and paid time off to colleagues who test positive or are quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19. Our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country enabled us to play an indispensable role in the national response to COVID-19, as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they needed us: in our CVS locations, in their homes, and virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily in the Company’s Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments. Health Care Benefits SegmentBeginning in mid-March, the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services (“utilization”) that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April, began to recover in May and June and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. In response to COVID-19, the Company expanded benefit coverage to its members. These expanded benefits included cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in the Company’s medical membership during the year. The Company experienced declines in Commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases in Medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment. Retail/LTC SegmentDuring March 2020, the Company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-place orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products.During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates. The Company offered COVID-19 diagnostic testing at more than 4,000 CVS Pharmacy locations as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company launched critical diagnostic testing for the vulnerable senior population in long-term care facilities in partnership with three states. The Company was also selected to administer COVID-19 vaccines in both long-term care facilities and its retail pharmacies. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities and in certain of its retail pharmacies during December 2020 and February 2021, respectively, and expects to play a significant role in COVID-19 vaccine administration in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. 68Results of OperationsThe following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019.

The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth in the Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses•Operating expenses increased $1.6 billion or 4.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 13.1% in both 2020 and 2019. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the reinstatement of the non-deductible health insurer fee (“HIF”) which was $1.0 billion for 2020, incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and increased operating expenses associated with growth in the business. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by (i) a $269 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which occurred on July 31, 2020, (ii) the absence of $231 million of store rationalization charges and a $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Drogaria 69Onofre Ltda. (“Onofre”), both recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019, and (iii) the favorable impact of enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives in 2020. •Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income •Operating income increased $1.9 billion or 16.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to:•Increased operating income in the Health Care Benefits segment, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-tax income of $307 million associated with the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain, and the $269 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business;•Increased operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment, primarily related to improved purchasing economics; and•The favorable impact of enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives in 2020, partially offset by:•Decreased operating income in the Retail/LTC segment, primarily as a result of continued reimbursement pressure and the net adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the absence of $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both recorded in 2019.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating income of the Company’s segments.Interest expense•Interest expense decreased $128 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average debt in 2020. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this report for additional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt•During 2020, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in August 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million, and the repayment of $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in December 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $674 million. During 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in August 2019, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Other income•Other income increased $82 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Other income represents pension plan asset returns in excess of interest cost on pension plan obligations. The increase in other income in 2020 was primarily due to lower discount rates in 2020 compared to 2019 when determining the interest cost on the Company’s pension plan obligations as well as strong plan asset returns. Income tax provision•The Company’s effective income tax rate remained consistent at 26.3% in both 2020 and 2019, with the impact of the non-deductible HIF offset by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the year ended December 31, 2020.Loss from discontinued operations•In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinued operations in 2020 primarily includes lease-related costs required to satisfy these lease guarantees.•See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ and “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about the Company’s discontinued operations and the Company’s lease guarantees, respectively.70Outlook for 2021With respect to 2021, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:•The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from continued growth in specialty pharmacy and our ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics, partially offset by continued price compression.•The Retail/LTC segment is expected to benefit from increased prescription volume, diagnostic testing and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. The projected adjusted prescription growth is expected to be driven by the continued successful execution of our patient care programs, the anticipated return of provider visits as we move through the year and vaccination administration. While lower front store traffic has persisted into the first quarter of 2021, we expect front store traffic to increase as we move through the year. •The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in our Medicaid products, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the removal of the HIF. The projected MBR is expected to increase compared to 2020, reflecting the return to more normal levels of utilization, the removal of the HIF, lower Medicare risk adjustment revenue and the continued shift in business mix. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to adversely impact earnings in 2021 due to the regulatory changes included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021; testing, treatment and vaccination costs; and lower Medicare risk adjustment revenue.•The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives that are expected to ramp as we move through the year. Key drivers include:◦The ongoing digitalization of our business along with technology improvements in our operations, ◦Office real estate reductions associated with workforce management changes and ◦Productivity/operational efficiency initiatives within each of the Company’s segments. •Based upon current tax legislation, the Company expects its effective income tax rate to decrease primarily due to the removal of the HIF in 2021. •The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company’s businesses.The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.71Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating segments, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Health Care Benefits, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.The following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:In millionsPharmacyServices (1)Retail/LTCHealth CareBenefitsCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminations (2)ConsolidatedTotals2020Total revenues $141,938 $91,198 $75,467 $426 $(40,323)$268,706 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,688 6,146 6,188 (1,306)(708)16,008 2019Total revenues141,491 86,608 69,604 512 (41,439)256,776 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,129 6,705 5,202 (1,000)(697)15,339 2018Total revenues134,736 83,989 8,962 606 (33,714)194,579 Adjusted operating income (loss)4,955 7,403 528 (856)(769)11,261 _____________________________________________(1)Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $10.9 billion, $11.5 billion and $11.4 billion of retail co-payments for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.73(2)In 2020, 2019 and 2018, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. In 2018, acquisition-related integration costs also relate to the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. (“Omnicare”). The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment and the Retail/LTC segment.(3)In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately $850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s RxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. The losses on divestiture in 2019 and 2018 are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.(4)In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA’s minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.(5)In 2019, the store rationalization charges relate to the planned closure of 46 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the second quarter of 2019 and the planned closure of 22 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the first quarter of 2020. The store rationalization charges primarily relate to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges and are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.(6)In 2018, the goodwill impairments relate to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. (7)In 2018, impairment of long-lived assets primarily relates to the impairment of property and equipment within the Retail/LTC segment and is reflected in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.(8)In 2018, the Company recorded interest income of $536 million on the proceeds of the $40 billion of unsecured senior notes it issued in March 2018 to partially fund the Aetna Acquisition. All amounts are for the periods prior to the close of the Aetna Acquisition, which occurred on November 28, 2018, and were recorded within the Corporate/Other segment.74Pharmacy Services SegmentThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018In millions, except percentages202020192018$%$%Revenues:Products$140,950$140,946$134,285$4 — %$6,661 5.0 %Services988545451443 81.3 %94 20.8 %Total revenues141,938141,491134,736447 0.3 %6,755 5.0 %Cost of products sold135,045135,245128,777(200)(0.1)%6,468 5.0 %Operating expenses1,4391,5111,352(72)(4.8)%159 11.8 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues1.0 %1.1 %1.0 %Operating income$5,454$4,735$4,607$719 15.2 %$128 2.8 %Operating income as a % of total revenues3.8 %3.3 %3.4 %Adjusted operating income (1)$5,688$5,129$4,955$559 10.9 %$174 3.5 %Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues4.0 %3.6 %3.7 %Revenues (by distribution channel): Pharmacy network (2)$85,045$88,755$87,167$(3,710)(4.2)%$1,588 1.8 %Mail choice (3)56,07152,14147,0493,930 7.5 %5,092 10.8 %Other822595520227 38.2 %75 14.4 %Pharmacy claims processed: (4)Total2,112.92,014.21,889.898.7 4.9 %124.4 6.6 %Pharmacy network (2)1,790.11,704.01,601.486.1 5.1 %102.6 6.4 %Mail choice (3)322.8310.2288.412.6 4.1 %21.8 7.6 %Generic dispensing rate: (4)Total88.2 %88.2 %87.3 %Pharmacy network (2)88.7 %88.7 %87.9 %Mail choice (3)85.3 %85.1 %83.9 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy Services segment.(2)Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice® activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Maintenance Choice permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order.(3)Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail order facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect® claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as prescriptions filled at the Company’s retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice program.(4)Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019Revenues•Total revenues increased $447 million, or 0.3%, to $141.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued price compression and changes in net new business mix.75Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.•Operating expenses decreased $72 million, or 4.8%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower amortization expense in 2020, partially offset by incremental operating expenses associated with growth in the business, including investments in the Company’s growth initiatives.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 1.0% and 1.1% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating income and adjusted operating income•Operating income increased $719 million, or 15.2%, and adjusted operating income increased $559 million, or 10.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in both operating income and adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression. The increase in operating income also was driven by lower amortization expense in 2020.•As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on operating income and adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company’s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends to continue. The “differential” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.Pharmacy claims processed•Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 5.1% to 1.8 billion claims in 2020 compared to 1.7 billion claims in 2019. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business.•The Company’s mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 4.1% to 322.8 million claims in 2020 compared to 310.2 million claims in 2019. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings. Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment’s generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Pharmacy Services segment’s total generic dispensing rate remained consistent at 88.2% in both 2020 and 2019. 76Retail/LTC SegmentThe following table summarizes the Retail/LTC segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018In millions, except percentages202020192018$%$%Revenues:Products$89,944$85,729$83,175$4,215 4.9 %$2,554 3.1 %Services1,254879814375 42.7 %65 8.0 %Total revenues91,19886,60883,9894,590 5.3 %2,619 3.1 %Cost of products sold 67,28462,68859,9064,596 7.3 %2,782 4.6 %Goodwill impairments——6,149— — %(6,149)(100.0)%Operating expenses18,27418,12717,314147 0.8 %813 4.7 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues20.0 %20.9 %20.6 %Operating income$5,640$5,793$620$(153)(2.6)%$5,173 834.4 %Operating income as a % of total revenues6.2 %6.7 %0.7 %Adjusted operating income (1)$6,146$6,705$7,403$(559)(8.3)%$(698)(9.4)%Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues6.7 %7.7 %8.8 %Revenues (by major goods/service lines):Pharmacy$70,176$66,442$64,179$3,734 5.6 %$2,263 3.5 %Front Store19,65519,42219,055233 1.2 %367 1.9 %Other1,367744755623 83.7 %(11)(1.5)%Prescriptions filled (2)1,465.21,417.21,339.148.0 3.4 %78.1 5.8 %Same store sales increase: (3)Total5.6 %3.7 %6.0 %Pharmacy7.0 %4.5 %7.9 %Front Store0.9 %1.1 %0.5 %Prescription volume (2)4.7 %7.2 %9.1 %Generic dispensing rate (2)88.3 %88.3 %87.5 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Retail/LTC segment.(2)Includes an adjustment to convert 90‑day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30‑day prescriptions.

Same store metrics exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, revenues and prescriptions from LTC operations and, in 2019 and 2018, revenues and prescriptions from stores in Brazil. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019Revenues •Total revenues increased $4.6 billion, or 5.3%, to $91.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription volume, COVID-19 diagnostic testing and brand inflation, partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.•Pharmacy same store sales increased 7.0% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was driven by the 4.7% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.77•Front store same store sales increased 0.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in consumer health and general merchandise sales.•Other revenues increased 83.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased diagnostic testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.•Operating expenses increased $147 million, or 0.8%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, the increased volume described above and investments in the business in 2020. The increase was partially offset by the absence of $231 million of store rationalization charges in connection with the planned closure of underperforming retail pharmacy stores and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both recorded in 2019, as well as the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2020. •Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 20.0% in 2020 compared to 20.9% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above.Operating income and adjusted operating income•Operating income decreased $153 million, or 2.6%, and adjusted operating income decreased $559 million, or 8.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in both operating income and adjusted operating income was primarily due to continued reimbursement pressure and the net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the increased pharmacy volume described above and improved generic drug purchasing. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced operating income and adjusted operating income in 2020 as a result of decreased customer traffic in the segment’s retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, partially offset by COVID-19 diagnostic testing. The decrease in operating income also was partially offset by the absence of the $231 million of store rationalization charges and the $205 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, both recorded in 2019.•As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The segment’s pharmacy operating income and adjusted operating income have been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its operating income and adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.•The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s operating income and adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.Prescriptions filled•Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•Prescriptions filled increased 3.4% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by the continued adoption of patient care programs, partially offset by reduced new therapy prescriptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased long-term care prescription volume.Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Retail/LTC segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Retail/LTC segment’s generic dispensing rate remained consistent at 88.3% in both 2020 and 2019. 78Health Care Benefits Segment For periods prior to November 28, 2018 (the Aetna Acquisition Date), the Health Care Benefits segment was comprised only of the Company’s SilverScript PDP business.

Accordingly, the MBR for the year ended December 31, 2018 is not meaningful (“NM”) and is not directly comparable to the MBRs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.(2)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment.Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019Revenues •Total revenues increased $5.9 billion, or 8.4%, to $75.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by membership growth in the Health Care Benefits segment’s Government products, the favorable impact of the reinstatement of the HIF for 2020 and the receipt of $313 million owed to the Company under the ACA’s risk corridor program. These increases were partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’s standalone PDPs (which the Company retained the financial results of through 2019) and Workers’ Compensation business, membership declines in the segment’s Commercial products and COVID-19 related investments benefiting customers in 2020.Medical Benefit Ratio (“MBR”)•Medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the Company’s Insured members. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.•The Health Care Benefits segment’s MBR decreased 330 basis points from 84.2% to 80.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to (i) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in reduced benefit costs due 79to the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization, partially offset by COVID-19 related investments, testing and treatment costs, (ii) the reinstatement of the HIF for 2020 and (iii) the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the ACA’s risk corridor program in 2020. Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.•Operating expenses increased $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the reinstatement of the HIF which was $1.0 billion for 2020 and incremental operating expenses to support the increased membership described above, including operating expenses to support additional Medicaid members onboarded during the first quarter of 2020. The increase was partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’s standalone PDPs and Workers’ Compensation business, the $269 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2020.Operating income and adjusted operating income•Operating income and adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in both operating income and adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the divestitures of Aetna’s standalone PDPs and Workers’ Compensation business. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced benefit costs due to the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization, partially offset by COVID-19 related investments, testing and treatment costs. Operating income also includes pre-tax income of $307 million associated with the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the ACA’s risk corridor program and the $269 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business in 2020.The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s medical membership as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:20202019In thousandsInsuredASC TotalInsuredASCTotalMedical membership:Commercial3,258 13,644 16,902 3,591 14,159 17,750 Medicare Advantage2,705 — 2,705 2,321 — 2,321 Medicare Supplement1,082 — 1,082 881 — 881 Medicaid2,100 623 2,723 1,398 558 1,956 Total medical membership9,145 14,267 23,412 8,191 14,717 22,908 Supplemental membership information:Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (standalone) (1)5,490 5,994 _____________________________________________(1)Represents the Company’s SilverScript PDP membership only.

Overall the Company projects the benchmark rates in the Final Notice will increase funding for its Medicare Advantage business, excluding the impact of the HIF in 2020, by approximately 1.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. 80On January 15, 2021, CMS issued its Final Notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%.The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company’s 2021 star ratings in October 2020. The Company’s 2021 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2022. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2020, 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least four stars, consistent with 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2020 star ratings of at least four stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2019.Corporate/Other SegmentThe following table summarizes the Corporate/Other segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018In millions, except percentages202020192018$%$%Revenues:Premiums$63 $91$4$(28)(30.8)%$87 2,175.0 %Services48 9—39 433.3 %9 100.0 %Net investment income315 412602(97)(23.5)%(190)(31.6)%Total revenues426 512606(86)(16.8)%(94)(15.5)%Benefit costs221 28522(64)(22.5)%263 1,195.5 %Operating expenses1,846 1,7101,389136 8.0 %321 23.1 %Operating loss(1,641)(1,483)(805)(158)(10.7)%(678)(84.2)%Adjusted operating loss (1)(1,306)(1,000)(856)(306)(30.6)%(144)(16.8)%_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating loss (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating loss for the Corporate/Other segment.Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019Revenues•Revenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products, that were acquired in the Aetna Acquisition. In 2018, revenues relate primarily to interest income on the proceeds from the financing of the Aetna Acquisition.•Total revenues decreased $86 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net investment income including an $80 million decrease in net realized capital gains in 2020 compared to 2019.Operating expenses•Operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment consist of management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. Subsequent to the Aetna Acquisition Date, segment operating expenses also include operating costs to support the Company’s large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.•Operating expenses increased $136 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s investments in transformation and its COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, as well as increased charitable contributions in 2020. The increase was partially offset by a $148 million decrease in acquisition-related integration costs compared to the prior year.81Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsThe Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, sale-leaseback program, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $7.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $2.2 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity and during the first half of the year caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the capital markets. As a result of the uncertainty generated by COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the Company issued $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes to enhance its liquidity and strengthen its capital. As markets stabilized, in August 2020, the Company purchased $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers, while issuing $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. In December 2020, the Company purchased $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers, while issuing $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. The Company will continue to monitor the severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and global economies, consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns and our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.The net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018In millions202020192018$%$%Net cash provided by operating activities$15,865 $12,848 $8,865 $3,017 23.5 %$3,983 44.9 %Net cash used in investing activities(5,534)(3,339)(43,285)(2,195)65.7 %39,946 92.3 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(8,155)(7,850)36,819 (305)3.9 %(44,669)(121.3)%Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash— — (4)— — %4 100.0 %Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$2,176 $1,659 $2,395 $517 31.2 %$(736)(30.7)%Commentary - 2020 compared to 2019•Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.0 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher operating income in the Health Care Benefits segment and the deferral of approximately $670 million of certain payroll tax payments to future years, as permitted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.•Net cash used in investing activities increased by $2.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increased net purchases of investments and an increase in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by $840 million in proceeds from the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business. In addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity:•Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020, approximately 62% of the Company’s total capital expenditures were for technology and other corporate initiatives, 30% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements and 8% were for new store construction. •Net cash used in financing activities increased slightly to $8.2 billion in 2020 compared to $7.9 billion in 2019. The increase in cash used in finance activities primarily related to an increase in net debt repaid during 2020 compared to 2019.82Included in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was the following store development activity: (1)202020192018Total stores (beginning of year)9,896 9,921 9,803 New and acquired stores (2)156 102 145 Closed stores (2)(90)(127)(27)Total stores (end of year)9,962 9,896 9,921 Relocated stores (2)18 23 34 _____________________________________________(1)Includes retail drugstores and pharmacies within retail chains, primarily in Target Corporation (“Target”) stores.(2)Relocated stores are not included in new and acquired stores or closed stores totals.Short-term BorrowingsCommercial Paper and Back-up Credit FacilitiesThe Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 12, 2021, a $1.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 18, 2022, a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 17, 2023 and a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2024. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company’s back-up credit facilities.Federal Home Loan Bank of BostonSince the Aetna Acquisition Date, a subsidiary of the Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLBB”). As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $925 million. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB.Long-term Borrowings2020 NotesOn December 16, 2020, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.875% unsecured senior notes due February 28, 2031 for total proceeds of approximately $1.99 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes represent a further issuance of the Company’s 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027 initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion on August 21, 2020.On August 21, 2020, the Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2030 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.7% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2040 (collectively, the “August 2020 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $3.97 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees.On March 31, 2020, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2027, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2030, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2040 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2050 (collectively, the “March 2020 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $3.95 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees.The net proceeds of these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, as well as the repurchase and/or repayment of indebtedness.During March 2020, the Company entered into several interest rate swap transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of the March 2020 Notes. In connection with the 83issuance of the March 2020 Notes, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company paid a net amount of $7 million to the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a loss, net of tax, of $5 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as interest expense over the life of the March 2020 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.2019 NotesOn August 15, 2019, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.625% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2024, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2026 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2029 (collectively, the “2019 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $3.46 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of the 2019 Notes were used to repay certain of the Company’s outstanding debt.Beginning in July 2019, the Company entered into several interest rate swap and treasury lock transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of the 2019 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company paid a net amount of $25 million to the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a loss, net of tax, of $18 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as interest expense over the life of the 2019 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Early Extinguishments of DebtIn December 2020, the Company purchased $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $113 million of its 4.0% senior notes due 2023, $1.4 billion of its 3.7% senior notes due 2023, $1.0 billion of its 4.1% senior notes due 2025 and $2.0 billion of its 4.3% senior notes due 2028. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $619 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $45 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $10 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $674 million.In August 2020, the Company purchased $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $723 million of its 4.0% senior notes due 2023, $2.3 billion of its 3.7% senior notes due 2023 and $3.0 billion of its 4.1% senior notes due 2025. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $706 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $47 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $13 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million.In August 2019, the Company purchased $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $1.3 billion of its 3.125% senior notes due 2020, $723 million of its floating rate notes due 2020, $328 million of its 4.125% senior notes due 2021, $297 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 issued by Aetna, $413 million of 5.45% senior notes due 2021 issued by Coventry Health Care, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, and $962 million of its 3.35% senior notes due 2021. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $76 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, incurred $8 million in fees and recognized a net gain of $5 million on the write-off of net unamortized deferred financing premiums, for a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ and Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. Debt CovenantsThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the 84Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s long-term debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), and its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. The outlook on the Company’s long-term debt is “Stable” by S&P. In December 2020, Moody’s changed the outlook on the Company’s long-term debt from “Negative” to “Stable.” In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. Share Repurchase ProgramsDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. See Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s share repurchase program. Quarterly Cash DividendDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, the quarterly cash dividend was $0.50 per share. CVS Health has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company and expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share throughout 2021. Future dividends will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board. Future Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2020, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at December 31, 2020 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

(2)The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to such operating and finance leases are reflected within the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities in the table above. Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings are reflected in the table above assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements. (3)Refer to Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the maturities of debt principal. Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2020.(4)Payments of other long-term liabilities exclude Separate Accounts liabilities of approximately $4.9 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business.85(5)Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $763 million, $2.0 billion and $210 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.(6)Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $2.9 billion have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unrealized capital gains on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $135 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.Restrictions on Certain PaymentsIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health as a holding company, since CVS Health is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’s debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. Under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.9 billion in the aggregate. The Company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held investments of $524 million and $537 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency RegulationThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2020, the RBC Ratio of each of the Company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2020, at that date, each of the Company’s active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.86Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.Revenue RecognitionPharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Pharmacy Services segment:•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and performed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.Drug DiscountsThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end 87and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.GuaranteesThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC SegmentRetail PharmacyThe Company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other ProgramsThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare®, consists of two components, ExtraSavingsTM and ExtraBucks® Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. ExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.The Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass®, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Long-term CareRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of Long-term Care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated 88differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.Walk-In Medical ClinicsFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Health Care Benefits SegmentHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which reflect contracted rates per employee and the number of covered employees recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. The Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operating results.Premium RevenuePremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.Services RevenueServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.Accounting for Medicare Part D Revenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.89In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Impairments of Debt SecuritiesThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.In evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $49 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not record credit-related impairment losses on debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses on debt securities of $24 million. There were no material OTTI losses on debt securities for the year ended December 31, 2018.The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.Vendor Allowances and Purchase DiscountsVendor and manufacturer receivables were $9.8 billion and $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC SegmentVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are 90recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon purchase volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.The Company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. The majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Historically, adjustments to the Company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.There have not been any material changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.InventoryInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The Company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $369 million and $401 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $37 million as of December 31, 2020.Although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease LiabilitiesThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.91For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentRecoverability of Definite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges).The long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded store rationalization charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a $43 million long-lived asset impairment charge, primarily related to the impairment of property and equipment.Recoverability of GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company’s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives. 2020 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the 92exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6% and 12%, respectively.In connection with the Aetna Acquisition in November 2018, the Company added the Health Care Benefits segment which included the Commercial Business reporting unit. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition. As a result, at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit was equal to its carrying value. The Company has experienced declines in its Commercial Insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the Aetna Acquisition and may continue to do so for a number of reasons, including as a result of the competitive Commercial business environment. In addition, COVID-19 has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on medical membership in the Commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers (including due to business failures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers. The Company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. Although the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable and achievable, the challenges described above may affect the Company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the Commercial Business reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so. As of December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance in the Commercial Business reporting unit was $26.5 billion.The LTC reporting unit continues to experience industry-wide challenges that have impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare in 2015. Those challenges included lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018, and continued facility reimbursement pressures. COVID-19 has also had an adverse impact on the financial health of the Company’s long-term care facility customers due to declines in occupancy rates and increased operating expenses. A number of these customers have relied on supplemental liquidity sources such as grants and advance Medicare payments under programs expanded or created under the CARES Act to maintain adequate liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic and may require additional sources of liquidity throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.Although the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the LTC reporting unit in the third quarter of 2020 were reasonable and achievable, the LTC reporting unit has faced challenges that affect the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so. These challenges and some of the key assumptions included in the Company’s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of the LTC reporting unit include client retention rates; occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities; the financial health of skilled nursing facility customers; facility reimbursement pressures; the Company’s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives; the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of COVID-19; COVID-19’s impact on health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to COVID-19. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit also is dependent on market multiples of peer group companies and the risk-free interest rate environment, which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow valuation method. If the LTC reporting unit does not achieve its forecasts, it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the LTC reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount. As of December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit was $431 million.The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted global economic activity in 2020, including the businesses of some of the Company’s customers, and during the first half of the year caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the capital markets. In addition to adversely affecting the Company’s businesses, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability and cash flows, these developments may adversely affect the timing and collectability of payments to the Company from customers, clients, government payers and members as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on them. For further information regarding the potential adverse impact of COVID-19 on the Company, please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against 93us. If the Company’s businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows are materially adversely affected, the goodwill of the LTC and Commercial Business reporting units could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount.2019 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4% and 9%, respectively.2018 Goodwill Impairment TestsAs discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2018, the LTC reporting unit experienced industry-wide challenges that impacted management’s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare and when the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed. Those challenges include lower client retention rates, lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities, the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018, and continued facility reimbursement pressures. Following the update of its current and long-term forecast, in June 2018, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $3.9 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment tests showed that the fair values of the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy reporting units exceeded their carrying values by significant margins and the fair value of the LTC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 2%. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the LTC reporting unit missed its forecast primarily due to operational issues and customer liquidity issues, including one significant customer bankruptcy. Additionally, LTC management submitted updated projected financial results which showed significant additional deterioration primarily due to continued industry and operational challenges, which also caused management to make further updates to its long-term forecast beyond 2019. Based on these updated projections, management determined that there were indicators that the LTC reporting unit’s goodwill may be further impaired and, accordingly, management performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018. The results of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in an additional $2.2 billion pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2018, the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. In addition to the lower financial projections, changes in risk-free interest rates and lower market multiples of peer group companies also contributed to the amount of the 2018 goodwill impairment charges.Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.Health Care Costs PayableAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, 77% and 73% respectively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been 94reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2020 and 2019, the Company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2020 and 2019 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 4 and 27 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $35 million and $240 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2020. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 11 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $140 million pretax.Also during 2020 and 2019, the Company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2020 and 2019 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were 4.0% and 3.2% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $394 million and $284 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2020, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 9.6% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Assumed health care cost trend rates during the fourth quarter of 2020 are elevated compared to historical levels due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilization during 2020. Specifically, beginning in mid-March, the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April, began to recover in May and June and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $404 million pretax.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. The Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.95New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.96Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk.Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality RiskThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.InvestmentsThe Company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2020 and 2019:In millions20202019Experience-rated products $1,037 $1,100 Remaining products22,775 18,587 Total investments$23,812 $19,687 Investment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.The debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 with approximately $6.3 billion and $4.4 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) were $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (of which 2% and 4% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, supported experience-rated products).At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held $321 million and $333 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing 2% of total investments at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A and A+ at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance 97for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.Evaluation of Market Valuation RisksThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities.Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2020 is as follows:•The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $5.3 billion ($6.7 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.•The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $490 million ($615 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-rated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt securities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.If the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $5 million ($7 million pretax).Based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2020.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity RiskAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively, of the Company’s investment portfolio was comprised of investments that have exposure to the oil and gas industry, with more than half that amount comprised of investment grade rated debt securities. These exposures are experiencing varied degrees of financial strains in the current depressed oil and gas price environment, and the likelihood of the Company’s portfolio incurring additional realized capital losses on these exposures may increase if such depressed prices persist and/or decline further.98Evaluation of Operational RisksThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security, including cybersecurity. The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively, including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages. Disruptions in our supply chains, our distribution chains and/or public and private infrastructure, including communications, financial services and supply chains, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number of our third-party service providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cyber attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.The Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2020. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.99Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:05:29.465319
64803,CVS,CVS HEALTH Corp,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (“MD&A”) The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “10-K”), “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K.Overview of BusinessCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “CVS Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a diversified health solutions company united around a common purpose of helping people on their path to better health. In an increasingly connected and digital world, we are meeting people wherever they are and changing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Overview of the Health Care Benefits SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services, and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers’ compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’ Compensation business”) prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.Overview of the Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities (“Covered Entities”). The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.Overview of the Retail/LTC SegmentThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic® walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy 67consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and onsite pharmacies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company dispensed approximately 26.4% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Corporate/Other SegmentThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related integration costs; and•Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.68COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and its emerging new variants continue to impact the U.S. and other countries around the world. Our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country has enabled us to continue to play an indispensable role in the national response to COVID-19, as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they need us: in our CVS locations, in their homes, and virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, primarily in the Company’s Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments. Health Care Benefits SegmentBeginning in mid-March 2020, the health system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services (“utilization”) that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April 2020, began to recover in May and June 2020 and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. In response to COVID-19, the Company provided expanded benefit coverage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. During 2020, COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in the Company’s medical membership. The Company experienced declines in Commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases in Medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment.During the year ended December 31, 2021, overall medical costs in the first quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate, however the segment experienced increased COVID-19 testing and treatment costs and lower Medicare risk-adjusted revenue. During the second quarter, COVID-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of COVID-19, which resulted in increased testing and treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year.Retail/LTC SegmentDuring March 2020, the Company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-place orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its CVS Pharmacy® locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at community-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its Return ReadySM solution. The Company also began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities during December 2020.During the first quarter of 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weak cough, cold and flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its retail pharmacies during February 2021. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer traffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the continued administration of COVID-19 vaccinations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of over-the-counter (“OTC”) test kits in the front store. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold more than 22 million OTC test kits. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. We believe COVID-19’s impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. 69Results of OperationsThe following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020.

The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth across all segments.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses•Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion or 5.5% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to incremental costs associated with growth in the business, including costs associated with the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing in the Retail/LTC segment. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the repeal of the non-deductible health insurer fee (“HIF”) for 2021 and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $263 million recorded in 2021. 70•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 12.7% in 2021 compared to 13.1% in 2020. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increases in total revenues referred to above.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income •Operating income decreased $718 million or 5.2% in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to:•A store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to planned retail store closures over the next three years; •Decreased operating income in the Health Care Benefits segment, driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, as well as the absence of pre-tax income of $307 million associated with the receipt of amounts owed to the Company under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) risk corridor program (“ACA risk corridor receipt”); and•A $431 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the LTC business in the Retail/LTC segment recorded during the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by:•Increased prescription and front store volume and the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing in the Retail/LTC segment;•Improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy in the Pharmacy Services segment; •Gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $263 million recorded in 2021; and•Lower acquisition-related integration costs in 2021 compared to the prior year.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating income of the Company’s segments.Interest expense•Interest expense decreased $404 million in 2021 compared to 2020, due to lower debt in the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this report for additional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt•During 2021, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of its outstanding senior notes in December 2021 pursuant to its early redemption make-whole provision for such senior notes, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $89 million, and the repayment of approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such notes in August 2021, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million. During 2020, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in August 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million, and the repayment of $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes in December 2020, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $674 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Income tax provision•The Company’s effective income tax rate decreased to 24.2% in 2021 compared to 26.3% in the prior year primarily due to the repeal of the non-deductible HIF for 2021 and the favorable impact of a prior year refund claim approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2020.Loss from discontinued operations•In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinued operations in 2020 primarily included lease-related costs required to satisfy these lease guarantees.71•See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ and “Lease Guarantees” in Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about the Company’s discontinued operations and the Company’s lease guarantees, respectively.72Outlook for 2022With respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:•The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021. •The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company’s ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.•The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.•The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company’s operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:•Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes, •Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and•Deploying vendor and procurement strategies. •The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company’s businesses.•The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the “Government Regulation” section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company’s businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.73Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating segments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.The following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacyServices (1)Retail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminations (2)ConsolidatedTotals2021Total revenues $82,186 $153,022 $100,105 $721 $(43,923)$292,111 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,012 6,859 7,623 (1,471)(711)17,312 2020Total revenues75,467 141,938 91,198 426 (40,323)268,706 Adjusted operating income (loss)6,188 5,688 6,146 (1,306)(708)16,008 2019Total revenues69,604 141,491 86,608 512 (41,439)256,776 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,202 5,129 6,705 (1,000)(697)15,339 _____________________________________________(1)Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $11.6 billion, $10.9 billion and $11.5 billion of retail co-payments for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about retail co-payments.(2)Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Health Care Benefits segment, the Pharmacy Services segment, and/or the Retail/LTC segment. Intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (“PSS members”) enrolled in Maintenance Choice® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company’s retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis.74The following are reconciliations of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income, as well as reconciliations of segment GAAP operating income to segment adjusted operating income:Year Ended December 31, 2021In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$3,521 $6,667 $5,322 $(1,606)$(711)$13,193 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,552 192 512 3 — 2,259 Acquisition-related integration costs (2)— — — 132 — 132 Store impairments (3)— — 1,358 — — 1,358 Goodwill impairment (4)— — 431 — — 431 Acquisition purchase price adjustment outside of measurement period (5)(61)— — — — (61)Adjusted operating income (loss)$5,012 $6,859 $7,623 $(1,471)$(711)$17,312 Year Ended December 31, 2020In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$5,166 $5,454 $5,640 $(1,641)$(708)$13,911 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,598 234 506 3 — 2,341 Acquisition-related integration costs (2)— — — 332 — 332 Gain on divestiture of subsidiary (6)(269)— — — — (269)Receipt of fully reserved ACA risk corridor receivable (7)(307)— — — — (307)Adjusted operating income (loss)$6,188 $5,688 $6,146 $(1,306)$(708)$16,008 Year Ended December 31, 2019In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$3,639 $4,735 $5,793 $(1,483)$(697)$11,987 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,563 394 476 3 — 2,436 Acquisition-related integration costs (2)— — — 480 — 480 Store impairments (3)— — 231 — — 231 Loss on divestiture of subsidiary (6)— — 205 — — 205 Adjusted operating income (loss)$5,202 $5,129 $6,705 $(1,000)$(697)$15,339 _____________________________________________(1)The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. (2)In 2021, 2020 and 2019, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Company’s acquisition (“Aetna Acquisition”) of Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). The acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment. (3)During the year ended December 31, 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store impairment charges related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets in connection with the planned closure of 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in 2019 and 2020. The store impairment charges are reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Retail/LTC segment. 75(4)During the year ended December 31, 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. (5)In June 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment. (6)In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately $850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment. (7)In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA’s minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.76Health Care Benefits Segment The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019In millions, except percentages and basis points (“bps”)202120202019$%$%Revenues:Premiums$76,064$69,301$63,031$6,7639.8 %$6,270 9.9 %Services5,5365,6835,974(147)(2.6)%(291)(4.9)%Net investment income58648359910321.3 %(116)(19.4)%Total revenues82,18675,46769,6046,7198.9 %5,863 8.4 %Benefit costs64,66256,08353,0928,57915.3 %2,991 5.6 %MBR (Benefit costs as a % of premium revenues) 85.0 %80.9 %84.2%410bps(330)bpsOperating expenses$14,003$14,218$12,873$(215)(1.5)%$1,345 10.4 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues17.0 %18.8 %18.5 %Operating income$3,521$5,166$3,639$(1,645)(31.8)%$1,527 42.0 %Operating income as a % of total revenues4.3 %6.8 %5.2 %Adjusted operating income (1)$5,012$6,188$5,202$(1,176)(19.0)%$986 19.0 %Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues6.1 %8.2 %7.5 %Premium revenues (by business):Government$55,739$48,928$41,818$6,81113.9 %$7,11017.0 %Commercial20,32520,37321,213(48)(0.2)%(840)(4.0)%_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020Revenues •Total revenues increased $6.7 billion, or 8.9%, to $82.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by growth in the Government Services business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the repeal of the HIF for 2021 and the absence of the ACA risk corridor receipt.Medical Benefit Ratio (“MBR”)•Medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the Company’s Insured members. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.•The MBR increased from 80.9% to 85.0% in 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by improved underlying performance in the current year.Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.•Operating expenses decreased $215 million, or 1.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by incremental operating expenses to support the growth in the Government Services business described above and the net impact of the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business sold on July 31, 2020. 77Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income decreased $1.2 billion, or 19.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. The decrease was partially offset by improved performance in the underlying Government Services business and higher favorable development of prior-years’ health care cost estimates in 2021 compared to the prior year.The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s medical membership as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:20212020In thousandsInsuredASC TotalInsuredASCTotalMedical membership:Commercial3,258 13,530 16,788 3,258 13,644 16,902 Medicare Advantage2,971 — 2,971 2,705 — 2,705 Medicare Supplement1,285 — 1,285 1,082 — 1,082 Medicaid2,333 471 2,804 2,100 623 2,723 Total medical membership9,847 14,001 23,848 9,145 14,267 23,412 Supplemental membership information:Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (standalone)5,777 5,490 Medical Membership•Medical membership represents the number of members covered by the Company’s Insured and ASC medical products and related services at a specified point in time.

Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%. The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company’s 2022 star ratings in October 2021. The Company’s 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2021, 87% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 83% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2020.78Pharmacy Services SegmentThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019In millions, except percentages202120202019$%$%Revenues:Products$151,851$140,950$140,946$10,901 7.7 %$4 — %Services1,171988545183 18.5 %443 81.3 %Total revenues153,022141,938141,49111,084 7.8 %447 0.3 %Cost of products sold144,894135,045135,2459,849 7.3 %(200)(0.1)%Operating expenses1,4611,4391,51122 1.5 %(72)(4.8)%Operating expenses as a % of total revenues1.0 %1.0 %1.1 %Operating income$6,667$5,454$4,735$1,213 22.2 %$719 15.2 %Operating income as a % of total revenues4.4 %3.8 %3.3 %Adjusted operating income (1)$6,859$5,688$5,129$1,171 20.6 %$559 10.9 %Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues4.5 %4.0 %3.6 %Revenues (by distribution channel): Pharmacy network (2)$91,715$85,045$88,755$6,670 7.8 %$(3,710)(4.2)%Mail choice (3)60,54756,07152,1414,476 8.0 %3,930 7.5 %Other760822595(62)(7.5)%227 38.2 %Pharmacy claims processed: (4)Total2,244.72,112.92,014.2131.8 6.2 %98.7 4.9 %Pharmacy network (2)1,914.01,790.11,704.0123.9 6.9 %86.1 5.1 %Mail choice (3)330.7322.8310.27.9 2.4 %12.6 4.1 %Generic dispensing rate: (4)Total86.8 %88.2 %88.2 %Pharmacy network (2)87.0 %88.7 %88.7 %Mail choice (3)85.6 %85.3 %85.1 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy Services segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.(2)Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice® activity, which is included within the mail choice category.

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020Revenues•Total revenues increased $11.1 billion, or 7.8%, to $153.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued price compression.79Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020. Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company’s group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression. •As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company’s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends to continue. The “differential” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.Pharmacy claims processed•Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020. •The Company’s mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.•Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment’s generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Pharmacy Services segment’s total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment’s total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.80Retail/LTC SegmentThe following table summarizes the Retail/LTC segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019In millions, except percentages202120202019$%$%Revenues:Products$95,652$89,944$85,729$5,708 6.3 %$4,215 4.9 %Services4,4361,2548793,182 253.7 %375 42.7 %Net investment income17——17 100.0 %— — %Total revenues100,10591,19886,6088,907 9.8 %4,590 5.3 %Cost of products sold 72,83267,28462,6885,548 8.2 %4,596 7.3 %Store impairments1,358—2311,358 100.0 %(231)(100.0)%Goodwill impairment431——431 100.0 %— — %Operating expenses20,16218,27417,8961,888 10.3 %378 2.1 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues20.1 %20.0 %20.7 %Operating income$5,322$5,640$5,793$(318)(5.6)%$(153)(2.6)%Operating income as a % of total revenues5.3 %6.2 %6.7 %Adjusted operating income (1)$7,623$6,146$6,705$1,477 24.0 %$(559)(8.3)%Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues7.6 %6.7 %7.7 %Revenues (by major goods/service lines):Pharmacy$76,121$70,176$66,442$5,945 8.5 %$3,734 5.6 %Front Store21,31519,65519,4221,660 8.4 %233 1.2 %Other2,6521,3677441,285 94.0 %623 83.7 %Net investment income17——17 100.0 %— — %Prescriptions filled (2)1,587.61,465.21,417.2122.4 8.4 %48.0 3.4 %Same store sales increase: (3)Total8.9 %5.6 %3.7 %Pharmacy9.3 %7.0 %4.5 %Front Store7.6 %0.9 %1.1 %Prescription volume (2)9.3 %4.7 %7.2 %Generic dispensing rate (2)85.7 %88.3 %88.3 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Retail/LTC segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.(2)Includes an adjustment to convert 90‑day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30‑day prescriptions.

Same store metrics exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, revenues and prescriptions from LTC operations and, in 2019, revenues and prescriptions from stores in Brazil. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020Revenues •Total revenues increased $8.9 billion, or 9.8%, to $100.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription and front store volume, the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions. COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales contributed approximately 45% of the increase in the segment’s revenues in 2021 compared to the prior year. The prior year reflected 81the ongoing expansion of the Company’s diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.•Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.•Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.•Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.Store impairments•During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Goodwill impairment•During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.•Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment’s capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company’s initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment’s capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. •As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The segment’s adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment’s adjusted operating income in 2021.•The segment’s adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.•The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.Prescriptions filled•Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well 82as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•Prescriptions filled increased 8.4%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by COVID-19 vaccinations and the continued adoption of patient care programs, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, prescriptions filled increased 4.3%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Retail/LTC segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Retail/LTC segment’s generic dispensing rate decreased to 85.7% in 2021 compared to 88.3% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment’s total generic dispensing rate increased to 89.0% in 2021.83Corporate/Other SegmentThe following table summarizes the Corporate/Other segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019In millions, except percentages202120202019$%$%Revenues:Premiums$68 $63$91$5 7.9 %$(28)(30.8)%Services57 4899 18.8 %39 433.3 %Net investment income596 315412281 89.2 %(97)(23.5)%Total revenues721 426512295 69.2 %(86)(16.8)%Cost of products sold37 ——37 100.0 %— — %Benefit costs212 221285(9)(4.1)%(64)(22.5)%Operating expenses2,078 1,8461,710232 12.6 %136 8.0 %Operating loss(1,606)(1,641)(1,483)35 2.1 %(158)(10.7)%Adjusted operating loss (1)(1,471)(1,306)(1,000)(165)(12.6)%(306)(30.6)%_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of Corporate/Other segment operating loss (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating loss, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020Revenues•Revenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.•Total revenues increased $295 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher net investment income, primarily driven by private equity investments and increased net realized capital gains in 2021 compared to 2020.Adjusted operating loss•Adjusted operating loss increased $165 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s investments in transformation, partially offset by the increase in net investment income in 2021 described above.84Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsThe Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $9.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $3.8 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.The net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019In millions202120202019$%$%Net cash provided by operating activities$18,265 $15,865 $12,848 $2,400 15.1 %$3,017 23.5 %Net cash used in investing activities(5,261)(5,534)(3,339)273 4.9 %(2,195)(65.7)%Net cash used in financing activities(11,356)(7,696)(7,654)(3,660)(47.6)%(42)(0.5)%Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$1,648 $2,635 $1,855 $(987)(37.5)%$780 42.0 %Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020•Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the timing of payments and higher operating income in the Retail/LTC segment. The increase was partially offset by reduced benefit costs due to the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in the Health Care Benefits segment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which favorably impacted operating cash flows in 2020 and did not recur during the current year.•Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $273 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increased proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by the absence of $840 million in proceeds from the sale of the Workers’ Compensation business in 2020 and increased purchases of investments during 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity:•Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2021, approximately 64% of the Company’s total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 36% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements. •Net cash used in financing activities increased to $11.4 billion in 2021 compared to $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash used in finance activities primarily related to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt during 2021 compared to the prior year. Included in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was the following store development activity: (1)202120202019Total stores (beginning of year)9,962 9,896 9,921 New and acquired stores (2)58 156 102 Closed stores (2)(81)(90)(127)Total stores (end of year)9,939 9,962 9,896 Relocated stores (2)17 18 23 _____________________________________________(1)Includes retail drugstores and pharmacies within retail chains, primarily in Target Corporation (“Target”) stores.85(2)Relocated stores are not included in new and acquired stores or closed stores totals.Short-term BorrowingsCommercial Paper and Back-up Credit FacilitiesThe Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 17, 2023, a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2024, and a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 11, 2026. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company’s back-up credit facilities.Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”)A subsidiary of the Company is a member of the FHLBB. As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $995 million. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB.Long-term Borrowings2021 NotesOn August 18, 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2031 for total proceeds of $987 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and offering expenses. The net proceeds of this offering were used for the purchase of senior notes in connection with the Company’s cash tender offer in August 2021 as described below.2020 NotesOn December 16, 2020, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.875% unsecured senior notes due February 28, 2031 for total proceeds of approximately $1.99 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes represent a further issuance of the Company’s 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027 initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion on August 21, 2020.On August 21, 2020, the Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.3% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2027, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2030 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.7% unsecured senior notes due August 21, 2040 (collectively, the “August 2020 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $3.97 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees.On March 31, 2020, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2027, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2030, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2040 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2050 (collectively, the “March 2020 Notes”) for total proceeds of approximately $3.95 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees.The net proceeds of these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, as well as the repurchase and/or repayment of indebtedness.During March 2020, the Company entered into several interest rate swap transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of the March 2020 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the March 2020 Notes, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company paid a net amount of $7 million to the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a loss, net of tax, of $5 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as interest expense over the life of the March 2020 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.86Early Extinguishments of DebtIn December 2021, the Company redeemed for cash the remaining $2.3 billion of its outstanding 3.7% senior notes due 2023. In connection with the early redemption of such senior notes, the Company paid a make-whole premium of $80 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were redeemed, wrote-off $8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $1 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $89 million.In August 2021, the Company purchased approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding 4.3% senior notes due 2028 through a cash tender offer. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $332 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $26 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $5 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million.In December 2020, the Company purchased $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $113 million of its 4.0% senior notes due 2023, $1.4 billion of its 3.7% senior notes due 2023, $1.0 billion of its 4.1% senior notes due 2025 and $2.0 billion of its 4.3% senior notes due 2028. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $619 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $45 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $10 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $674 million.In August 2020, the Company purchased $6.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $723 million of its 4.0% senior notes due 2023, $2.3 billion of its 3.7% senior notes due 2023 and $3.0 billion of its 4.1% senior notes due 2025. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $706 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $47 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $13 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million.In August 2019, the Company purchased $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers. The senior notes purchased included the following: $1.3 billion of its 3.125% senior notes due 2020, $723 million of its floating rate notes due 2020, $328 million of its 4.125% senior notes due 2021, $297 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 issued by Aetna, $413 million of 5.45% senior notes due 2021 issued by Coventry Health Care, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, and $962 million of its 3.35% senior notes due 2021. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $76 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, incurred $8 million in fees and recognized a net gain of $5 million on the write-off of net unamortized deferred financing premiums, for a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ and Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. Debt CovenantsThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s long-term debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), and its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. The outlook on the Company’s long-term debt is “Stable” by Moody’s and “Positive” by S&P. In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity 87and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. Share Repurchase ProgramsDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. See Note 12 ‘‘Shareholders’ Equity’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s share repurchase program. Quarterly Cash DividendDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the quarterly cash dividend was $0.50 per share. In December 2021, CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.55 per share effective in 2022. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividends will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board. Future Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2021, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at December 31, 2021 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

(2)The Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to such operating and finance leases are reflected within the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities in the table above. Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings are reflected in the table above assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements. (3)Refer to Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the maturities of debt principal. Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2021.(4)Payments of other long-term liabilities exclude Separate Accounts liabilities of approximately $5.1 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business.(5)Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $728 million, $1.6 billion and $186 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.(6)Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $3.0 billion have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unrealized capital gains on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $92 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.Restrictions on Certain PaymentsIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the 88amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health Corporation as a holding company, since CVS Health Corporation is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’s debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. Under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2021, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.9 billion in the aggregate. The Company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held investments of $450 million and $524 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency RegulationThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2021, the RBC Ratio of each of the Company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2021, at that date, each of the Company’s active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.89Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.Revenue RecognitionHealth Care Benefits SegmentHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government business is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility. The Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operating results.Premium RevenuePremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.Services RevenueServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.90Accounting for Medicare Part D Revenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Pharmacy Services segment:•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.Drug DiscountsThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates 91payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.GuaranteesThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC SegmentRetail PharmacyThe Company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other ProgramsThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare®, consists of two components, ExtraSavingsTM and ExtraBucks® Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. ExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.The Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass®, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Long-term CareRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. 92Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.Walk-In Medical ClinicsFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Impairments of Debt SecuritiesThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.In evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $42 million and $49 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record credit-related impairment losses on debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses on debt securities of $24 million. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.Vendor Allowances and Purchase DiscountsVendor and manufacturer receivables were $10.6 billion and $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.93Retail/LTC SegmentVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.The Company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. The majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Historically, adjustments to the Company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.There have not been any material changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.InventoryInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The Company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $522 million and $369 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $52 million as of December 31, 2021.Although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease LiabilitiesThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its right-of-use assets as described in “Long-Lived Asset Impairment” below. The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and 94regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentRecoverability of Definite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).The long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 stores over the next three years. The Company expects to close approximately 300 stores each year between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups were lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the Retail/LTC segment. There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $231 million, primarily related to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges. Recoverability of GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.95The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company’s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives. 2021 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%.As discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company’s long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. Subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021, there is no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. The Company has experienced declines in its Commercial Insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the Aetna Acquisition and may continue to do so for a number of reasons, including as a result of the competitive Commercial business environment. In addition, COVID-19 and the emerging new variants have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on medical membership in the Commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers (including due to business failures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefit providers by prospective customers. The Company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. Although the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2021 were reasonable and achievable, the challenges described above may affect the Company’s ability to increase medical membership or operating income in the Commercial Business reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed and may continue to do so. As of December 31, 2021, the goodwill balance in the Commercial Business reporting unit was $26.5 billion.2020 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6% and 12%, respectively.2019 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4% and 9%, respectively.96Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.Health Care Costs PayableAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, 75% and 77% respectively, of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2021 and 2020, the Company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 21 and 4 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $207 million and $35 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2021. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 13 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $186 million pretax.Also during 2021 and 2020, the Company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2021 and 2020 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were 5.0% and 4.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $581 million and $394 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2021, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 1.8% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Health care cost trend rates during the past two years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies experiencing utilization impacts due to COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $450 million pretax.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period 97in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. The Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.98Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk.Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality RiskThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.InvestmentsThe Company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2021 and 2020:In millions20212020Experience-rated products $957 $1,037 Remaining products25,185 22,775 Total investments$26,142 $23,812 Investment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.The debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, with a fair value of approximately $6.7 billion and $6.3 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (of which 2% at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 supported experience-rated products).At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held $305 million and $321 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing 1% of total investments at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance 99for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income. The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.Evaluation of Market Valuation RisksThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2021 is as follows:•The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $4.6 billion ($5.8 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.•The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $680 million ($860 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-rated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt securities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.If the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $14 million ($18 million pretax).Based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2021.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity RiskAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.Evaluation of Operational RisksThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security, including cybersecurity. The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively, including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages. Disruptions in our supply chains, our distribution chains and/or public and private infrastructure, including communications, financial services and supply chains, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a significant number of our third-party service providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cyber attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.100The Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2021. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.101Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:05:28.899569
64803,CVS,CVS HEALTH Corp,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (“MD&A”) The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “10-K”), “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K.Overview of BusinessCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “CVS Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a leading diversified health solutions company reshaping health care to help make healthier happen for more Americans. In an increasingly connected and digital world, CVS Health is meeting people wherever they are and changing health care to meet their needs. The Company has more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with over 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”). The Company believes its integrated health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.Overview of the Health Care Benefits SegmentThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services, and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers’ compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers’ Compensation business (“Workers’ Compensation business”) prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment’s customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers (“providers”), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers. The Company entered Public Exchanges in four additional states effective January 2023.Overview of the Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities (“Covered Entities”).The Company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants. The Company also provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Pharmacy Services segment’s clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.69Overview of the Retail/LTC SegmentThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic® walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2022, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,100 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company dispensed 26.8% of the total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the United States.Overview of the Corporate/Other SegmentThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:•Management and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company’s investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related integration costs; and•Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.70COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. Our strong local presence and scale in communities across the country has enabled us to continue to play an indispensable role in the national response to COVID-19, as well as provide seamless support for our customers wherever they need us: in our CVS locations, in their homes, and virtually. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, primarily in the Company’s Health Care Benefits and Retail/LTC segments. Health Care Benefits SegmentBeginning in mid-March 2020, the health care system experienced a significant reduction in utilization of medical services (“utilization”) that is discretionary and the cancellation of elective medical procedures. Utilization remained below historical levels through April 2020, began to recover in May and June 2020 and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. In response to COVID-19, the Company provided expanded benefit coverage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. During 2020, COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in the Company’s medical membership. The Company experienced declines in Commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases in Medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment.During the year ended December 31, 2021, overall medical costs in the first quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in the aggregate, however the segment experienced increased COVID-19 testing and treatment costs and lower Medicare risk-adjusted revenue. During the second quarter, COVID-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of COVID-19, which resulted in increased testing and treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year.During the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of COVID-19 within the Health Care Benefits segment has generally stabilized as a result of the Company’s ability to capture COVID-19 related medical costs in pricing.Retail/LTC SegmentDuring March 2020, the Company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance medications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-place orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees associated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local communities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its CVS pharmacy locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at community-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its Return ReadySM solution. The Company also began administering COVID-19 vaccinations in long-term care facilities during December 2020.During the first quarter of 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weaker cough, cold and flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its retail pharmacies during February 2021. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer traffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations. During the third and fourth quarters, emerging new variants drove the continued administration of COVID-19 vaccinations (including boosters) and diagnostic testing, while the segment also generated earnings from the sale of over-the-counter (“OTC”) test kits in the front store. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold more than 22 million OTC test kits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the customary quarterly operating income progression in the Retail/LTC segment continued to be impacted by COVID-19. During the first quarter, the Company saw high volumes of administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as demand for OTC test kits in the front store, particularly in the beginning of the year when 71the Omicron variant incidence was high. In addition, the Company administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of 2022 during the first quarter, however a decline compared to the prior year. During the second and third quarters, the Company continued to generate earnings from the sale of OTC test kits, as customers performed more in-home testing versus diagnostic testing, in addition to earnings from the continued administration of COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, albeit at lower levels than those experienced in the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, the Company saw an increase in COVID-19 vaccine administration from the prior quarter related to the bivalent COVID-19 booster. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company administered more than 15 million COVID-19 tests and nearly 28 million COVID-19 vaccines and sold more than 63 million OTC test kits.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.72Results of OperationsThe following information summarizes the Company’s results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. For discussion of the Company’s results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 9, 2022.Summary of Consolidated Financial ResultsChangeYear Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions202220212020$%$%Revenues:Products$226,616 $203,738 $190,688 $22,878 11.2 %$13,050 6.8 %Premiums85,330 76,132 69,364 9,198 12.1 %6,768 9.8 %Services9,683 11,042 7,856 (1,359)(12.3)%3,186 40.6 %Net investment income838 1,199 798 (361)(30.1)%401 50.3 %Total revenues322,467 292,111 268,706 30,356 10.4 %23,405 8.7 %Operating costs:Cost of products sold196,892 175,803 163,981 21,089 12.0 %11,822 7.2 %Benefit costs71,281 64,260 55,679 7,021 10.9 %8,581 15.4 %Opioid litigation charges5,803 — — 5,803 100.0 %— — %Loss on assets held for sale2,533 — — 2,533 100.0 %— — %Store impairments — 1,358 — (1,358)(100.0)%1,358 100.0 %Goodwill impairment— 431 — (431)(100.0)%431 100.0 %Operating expenses38,212 37,066 35,135 1,146 3.1 %1,931 5.5 %Total operating costs314,721 278,918 254,795 35,803 12.8 %24,123 9.5 %Operating income7,746 13,193 13,911 (5,447)(41.3)%(718)(5.2)%Interest expense2,287 2,503 2,907 (216)(8.6)%(404)(13.9)%Loss on early extinguishment of debt— 452 1,440 (452)(100.0)%(988)(68.6)%Other income(169)(182)(206)13 7.1 %24 11.7 %Income before income tax provision5,628 10,420 9,770 (4,792)(46.0)%650 6.7 %Income tax provision1,463 2,522 2,569 (1,059)(42.0)%(47)(1.8)%Income from continuing operations4,165 7,898 7,201 (3,733)(47.3)%697 9.7 %Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — (9)— — %9 100.0 %Net income4,165 7,898 7,192 (3,733)(47.3)%706 9.8 %Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests(16)12 (13)(28)(233.3)%25 192.3 %Net income attributable to CVS Health$4,149 $7,910 $7,179 $(3,761)(47.5)%$731 10.2 %Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021Revenues•Total revenues increased $30.4 billion, or 10.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by growth across all segments.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the revenues of the Company’s segments.Operating expenses•Operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 3.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating expenses to support growth in the business, incremental investments in business operations and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets compared to the prior year, as well as pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale 73of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary bswift LLC (“bswift”) and $225 million on the sale of PayFlex Holdings, Inc. (“PayFlex”), both of which were sold during 2022.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 11.8% in 2022 compared to 12.7% in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increases in total revenues described above.•Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company’s segments.Operating income •Operating income decreased $5.4 billion, or 41.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the $5.8 billion of opioid litigation charges and declines in the Retail/LTC segment, which included a $2.5 billion loss on assets held for sale related to the write-down of the Company’s Omnicare® long-term care business (“LTC business”) during 2022, partially offset by the absence of a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion and a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit, both of which were recorded in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the Health Care Benefits segment, which included the pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale of bswift and $225 million on the sale of PayFlex and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, as well as improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy in the Pharmacy Services segment. •Please see “Segment Analysis” later in this MD&A for additional information about the operating results of the Company’s segments.Interest expense•Interest expense decreased $216 million, or 8.6%, in 2022 compared to 2021, due to lower debt in the year ended December 31, 2022. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this report for additional information.Loss on early extinguishment of debt•During 2021, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of its outstanding senior notes in December 2021 pursuant to its early redemption make-whole provision for such senior notes, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $89 million, and the repayment of approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to its tender offer for such notes in August 2021, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million. See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Income tax provision•The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 26.0% in 2022 compared to 24.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to certain nondeductible legal charges and basis differences on the sale of certain subsidiaries in 2022. These increases were partially offset by the impact of certain discrete tax items concluded in the first quarter of 2022.74Outlook for 2023With respect to 2023, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:•The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to continue to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by declines in Medicaid due to the impact of redeterminations in 2023.•The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to continue to benefit from the Company’s ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and strong pharmacy network volume. These increases are expected to be partially offset by continued client price improvements and regulation of pharmacy pricing.•The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower contributions from COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kits as COVID-19 transitions to the endemic stage. •The Company is expected to benefit from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company’s operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:•Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes, •Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and•Deploying vendor and procurement strategies. •The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company’s businesses.•The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the “Government Regulation” section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company’s businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.75Segment AnalysisThe following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the Company’s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in Note 17 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company has three operating segments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.The following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacyServices (1)Retail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminations (2)ConsolidatedTotals2022Total revenues $91,409 $169,236 $106,594 $530 $(45,302)$322,467 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,984 7,356 6,705 (1,785)(728)17,532 2021Total revenues82,186 153,022 100,105 721 (43,923)292,111 Adjusted operating income (loss)5,012 6,859 7,623 (1,471)(711)17,312 2020Total revenues75,467 141,938 91,198 426 (40,323)268,706 Adjusted operating income (loss)6,188 5,688 6,146 (1,306)(708)16,008 _____________________________________________(1)Total revenues of the Pharmacy Services segment include approximately $12.6 billion, $11.6 billion and $10.9 billion of retail co-payments for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about retail co-payments.(2)Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Health Care Benefits segment, the Pharmacy Services segment, and/or the Retail/LTC segment. Intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services segment clients enrolled in Maintenance Choice® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company’s retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis.76The following are reconciliations of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income, as well as reconciliations of segment GAAP operating income to segment adjusted operating income:Year Ended December 31, 2022In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$5,118 $7,187 $3,778 $(7,609)$(728)$7,746 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,203 167 435 3 — 1,808 Office real estate optimization charges (2)97 2 — 18 — 117 Gain on divestiture of subsidiaries (3)(475)— — — — (475)Opioid litigation charges (4)— — — 5,803 — 5,803 Loss on assets held for sale (5)41 — 2,492 — — 2,533 Adjusted operating income (loss)$5,984 $7,356 $6,705 $(1,785)$(728)$17,532 Year Ended December 31, 2021In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$3,521 $6,667 $5,322 $(1,606)$(711)$13,193 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,552 192 512 3 — 2,259 Acquisition-related integration costs (6)— — — 132 — 132 Store impairments (7)— — 1,358 — — 1,358 Goodwill impairment (8)— — 431 — — 431 Acquisition purchase price adjustment outside of measurement period (9)(61)— — — — (61)Adjusted operating income (loss)$5,012 $6,859 $7,623 $(1,471)$(711)$17,312 Year Ended December 31, 2020In millionsHealth CareBenefitsPharmacy ServicesRetail/LTCCorporate/OtherIntersegmentEliminationsConsolidatedTotalsOperating income (loss) (GAAP measure)$5,166 $5,454 $5,640 $(1,641)$(708)$13,911 Amortization of intangible assets (1)1,598 234 506 3 — 2,341 Acquisition-related integration costs (6)— — — 332 — 332 Gain on divestiture of subsidiary (3)(269)— — — — (269)Receipt of fully reserved ACA risk corridor receivable (10)(307)— — — — (307)Adjusted operating income (loss)$6,188 $5,688 $6,146 $(1,306)$(708)$16,008 _____________________________________________(1)The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. (2)In 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments. (3)In 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which the Company sold in June 2022. In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the 77sale of the Workers’ Compensation business, which the Company sold in July 2020. The gains on divestitures are reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. (4)In 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities. The opioid litigation charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.(5)In 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. The Company continually evaluates its portfolio for non-strategic assets. The Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and during the third quarter of 2022 committed to a plan to sell the LTC business. As of September 30, 2022, the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and the net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the third quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the net assets of the LTC business continued to meet the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and during the fourth quarter of 2022, an incremental loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March 2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business goodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business. The net assets of the Thailand business were accounted for as assets held for sale at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of the Thailand business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the first quarter of 2022. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material.(6)In 2021 and 2020, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Company’s acquisition (the “Aetna Acquisition”) of Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”). The acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment. (7)In 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. The store impairment charge is reflected within the Retail/LTC segment. (8)In 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to an impairment of the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. (9)In 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment. (10)In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”)’s risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA’s minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company’s GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.78Health Care Benefits Segment The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions, except percentages and basis points (“bps”)202220212020$%$%Revenues:Premiums$85,274$76,064$69,301$9,210 12.1 %$6,763 9.8 %Services5,6595,5365,683123 2.2 %(147)(2.6)%Net investment income476586483(110)(18.8)%103 21.3 %Total revenues91,40982,18675,4679,223 11.2 %6,719 8.9 %Benefit costs71,61164,66256,0836,949 10.7 %8,579 15.3 %MBR (Benefit costs as a % of premium revenues) 84.0 %85.0 %80.9%(100)bps410bpsLoss on assets held for sale $41 $— $— $41 100.0 %$— — %Operating expenses14,63914,00314,218636 4.5 %(215)(1.5)%Operating expenses as a % of total revenues16.0 %17.0 %18.8 %Operating income$5,118$3,521$5,166$1,597 45.4 %$(1,645)(31.8)%Operating income as a % of total revenues5.6 %4.3 %6.8 %Adjusted operating income (1)$5,984$5,012$6,188$972 19.4 %$(1,176)(19.0)%Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues6.5 %6.1 %8.2 %Premium revenues (by business):Government$63,141$55,739$48,928$7,40213.3 %$6,81113.9 %Commercial22,13320,32520,3731,8088.9 %(48)(0.2)%_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021Revenues •Total revenues increased $9.2 billion, or 11.2%, to $91.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 driven by growth across all product lines.Medical Benefit Ratio•Medical benefit ratio is calculated as benefit costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the Company’s Insured members. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.•The MBR decreased from 85.0% to 84.0% in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the net favorable impact of COVID-19 compared to the prior year, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the flu compared to the prior year.Loss on assets held for sale•During 2022, the Company recorded a $41 million loss on assets held for sale on its Thailand business, which is included in the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.79•Operating expenses increased $636 million, or 4.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across all product lines described above, incremental investments in the business, as well as office real estate optimization charges recorded in 2022 in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space. These increases were partially offset by the pre-tax gains of $250 million on the sale of bswift and $225 million on the sale of PayFlex. •Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16.0% in 2022 compared to 17.0% in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above and the pre-tax gains on the sales of bswift and PayFlex.Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income increased $972 million, or 19.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the net favorable impact of COVID-19 compared to the prior year, strong underlying performance and membership growth. These increases were partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business, the unfavorable impact of the flu compared to the prior year and net realized capital losses.The following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s medical membership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:20222021In thousandsInsuredASC TotalInsuredASCTotalMedical membership:Commercial3,136 13,896 17,032 3,258 13,530 16,788 Medicare Advantage3,270 — 3,270 2,971 — 2,971 Medicare Supplement1,363 — 1,363 1,285 — 1,285 Medicaid2,234 497 2,731 2,333 471 2,804 Total medical membership10,003 14,393 24,396 9,847 14,001 23,848 Supplemental membership information:Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (standalone)6,128 5,777 Medical Membership•Medical membership represents the number of members covered by the Company’s Insured and ASC medical products and related services at a specified point in time.

This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of medical membership on segment total revenues and operating results.•Medical membership as of December 31, 2022 of 24.4 million increased 548,000 compared with December 31, 2021, reflecting increases in Medicare and Commercial membership, as underlying Commercial growth more than offset the impact of international divestitures. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Medicaid membership reflecting the previously disclosed loss of a large customer in the third quarter of 2022.Medicare UpdateOn April 4, 2022, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued its final notice detailing final 2023 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2023 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. On February 1, 2023, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2024 Medicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.27%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than April 3, 2023.The ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company’s 2023 star ratings in October 2022. The Company’s 2023 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2024. Based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2022, 21% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2023 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 87% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership at December 31, 2021.80Pharmacy Services SegmentThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions, except percentages202220212020$%$%Revenues:Products$168,004$151,851$140,950$16,153 10.6 %$10,901 7.7 %Services1,2321,17198861 5.2 %183 18.5 %Total revenues169,236153,022141,93816,214 10.6 %11,084 7.8 %Cost of products sold160,421144,894135,04515,527 10.7 %9,849 7.3 %Operating expenses1,6281,4611,439167 11.4 %22 1.5 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues1.0 %1.0 %1.0 %Operating income$7,187$6,667$5,454$520 7.8 %$1,213 22.2 %Operating income as a % of total revenues4.2 %4.4 %3.8 %Adjusted operating income (1)$7,356$6,859$5,688$497 7.2 %$1,171 20.6 %Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues4.3 %4.5 %4.0 %Revenues (by distribution channel): Pharmacy network (2)$97,668$91,715$85,045$5,953 6.5 %$6,670 7.8 %Mail choice (3)70,46660,54756,0719,919 16.4 %4,476 8.0 %Other1,102760822342 45.0 %(62)(7.5)%Pharmacy claims processed: (4)Total2,336.62,244.72,112.991.9 4.1 %131.8 6.2 %Pharmacy network (2)2,003.61,914.01,790.189.6 4.7 %123.9 6.9 %Mail choice (3)333.0330.7322.82.3 0.7 %7.9 2.4 %Generic dispensing rate: (4)Total87.4 %86.8 %88.2 %Pharmacy network (2)87.7 %87.0 %88.7 %Mail choice (3)85.6 %85.6 %85.3 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy Services segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.(2)Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice® activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Maintenance Choice permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order.(3)Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail order facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect® claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as prescriptions filled at the Company’s retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice program.(4)Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021Revenues•Total revenues increased $16.2 billion, or 10.6%, to $169.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements. 81Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.•Operating expenses increased $167 million, or 11.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by restructuring and business integration costs recorded in 2022.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2022 and 2021. Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income increased $497 million, or 7.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of the Company’s group purchasing organization, partially offset by continued client price improvements. •As you review the Pharmacy Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company’s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends to continue. The “differential” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.Pharmacy claims processed•Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•The Company’s pharmacy network claims processed increased 4.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by net new business, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 vaccinations.•The Company’s mail choice claims processed increased 0.7% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by net new business and the increased utilization of Maintenance Choice prescriptions. •Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 5.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to the prior year.Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment’s generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Pharmacy Services segment’s total generic dispensing rate increased to 87.4% in 2022 compared to 86.8% in the prior year. The increase in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by a decrease in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to decreased COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022 compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment’s total generic dispensing rate was 88.3% and 88.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.82Retail/LTC SegmentThe following table summarizes the Retail/LTC segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions, except percentages202220212020$%$%Revenues:Products$103,762$95,652$89,944$8,110 8.5 %$5,708 6.3 %Services2,8764,4361,254(1,560)(35.2)%3,182 253.7 %Net investment income (loss)(44)17—(61)(358.8)%17 100.0 %Total revenues106,594100,10591,1986,489 6.5 %8,907 9.8 %Cost of products sold 79,68472,83267,2846,852 9.4 %5,548 8.2 %Loss on assets held for sale2,492——2,492 100.0 %— — %Store impairments—1,358—(1,358)(100.0)%1,358 100.0 %Goodwill impairment—431—(431)(100.0)%431 100.0 %Operating expenses20,64020,16218,274478 2.4 %1,888 10.3 %Operating expenses as a % of total revenues19.4 %20.1 %20.0 %Operating income$3,778$5,322$5,640$(1,544)(29.0)%$(318)(5.6)%Operating income as a % of total revenues3.5 %5.3 %6.2 %Adjusted operating income (1)$6,705$7,623$6,146$(918)(12.0)%$1,477 24.0 %Adjusted operating income as a % of total revenues6.3 %7.6 %6.7 %Revenues (by major goods/service lines):Pharmacy$82,010$76,121$70,176$5,889 7.7 %$5,945 8.5 %Front Store22,78021,31519,6551,465 6.9 %1,660 8.4 %Other1,8482,6521,367(804)(30.3)%1,285 94.0 %Net investment income (loss)(44)17—(61)(358.8)%17 100.0 %Prescriptions filled (2)1,623.81,587.61,465.236.2 2.3 %122.4 8.4 %Same store sales increase: (3)Total9.0 %8.9 %5.6 %Pharmacy9.5 %9.3 %7.0 %Front Store7.4 %7.6 %0.9 %Prescription volume (2)4.0 %9.3 %4.7 %Generic dispensing rate (2)87.4 %85.7 %88.3 %_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Retail/LTC segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.(2)Includes an adjustment to convert 90‑day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30‑day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.(3)Same store sales and prescription volume represent the change in revenues and prescriptions filled in the Company’s retail pharmacy stores that have been operating for greater than one year, expressed as a percentage that indicates the increase or decrease relative to the comparable prior period. Same store metrics exclude revenues from MinuteClinic and revenues and prescriptions from LTC operations. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021Revenues •Total revenues increased $6.5 billion, or 6.5%, to $106.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription and front store volume, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year and increased sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits in 2022 compared to 2021, as well as pharmacy 83drug mix and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.•Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the 4.0% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.•Front store same store sales increased 7.4% in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year and increased sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits in 2022 compared to 2021.•Other revenues decreased 30.3% in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2022 compared to the prior year. Loss on assets held for sale•During 2022, the Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale of approximately $2.5 billion related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Store impairments•During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Goodwill impairment•During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information. Operating expenses•Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.•Operating expenses increased $478 million, or 2.4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses associated with COVID-19 vaccination administration compared to the prior year and the favorable impact of business initiatives in 2022.•Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 19.4% in 2022 compared to 20.1% in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily driven by the increases in total revenues described above.Adjusted operating income•Adjusted operating income decreased $918 million, or 12.0%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities and decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared to 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives in 2022. •As you review the Retail/LTC segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:•The segment’s adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.•The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment’s adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.84Prescriptions filled•Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment’s pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.•Prescriptions filled increased 2.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 vaccinations. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, prescriptions filled increased 4.4%, on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2022 compared to the prior year.Generic dispensing rate•Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Retail/LTC segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. •The Retail/LTC segment’s generic dispensing rate increased to 87.4% in 2022 compared to 85.7% in the prior year. The increase in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by a decrease in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to decreased COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022 compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment’s total generic dispensing rate was 89.0% in both 2022 and 2021.85Corporate/Other SegmentThe following table summarizes the Corporate/Other segment’s performance for the respective periods:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions, except percentages202220212020$%$%Revenues:Premiums$56 $68$63$(12)(17.6)%$5 7.9 %Services68 574811 19.3 %9 18.8 %Net investment income406 596315(190)(31.9)%281 89.2 %Total revenues530 721426(191)(26.5)%295 69.2 %Cost of products sold42 37—5 13.5 %37 100.0 %Benefit costs319 212221107 50.5 %(9)(4.1)%Opioid litigation charges5,803 ——5,803 100.0 %— — %Operating expenses1,975 2,0781,846(103)(5.0)%232 12.6 %Operating loss(7,609)(1,606)(1,641)(6,003)(373.8)%35 2.1 %Adjusted operating loss (1)(1,785)(1,471)(1,306)(314)(21.3)%(165)(12.6)%_____________________________________________(1)See “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of Corporate/Other segment operating loss (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating loss, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021Revenues•Revenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.•Total revenues decreased $191 million, or 26.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by net realized capital losses in 2022 compared to net realized capital gains in 2021 and lower net investment income from private equity investments, partially offset by higher average invested assets and favorable average investment yields in 2022 compared to 2021.Opioid litigation charges•During 2022, the Company recorded $5.8 billion of opioid litigation charges. See Note 16 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Adjusted operating loss•Adjusted operating loss increased $314 million, or 21.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the decreases in net investment income described above and the strengthening of reserves in the Company’s long-term care insurance business, which occurred during the second quarter of 2022.86Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsThe Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $12.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $5.4 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.The net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:ChangeYear Ended December 31,2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020In millions202220212020$%$%Net cash provided by operating activities$16,177 $18,265 $15,865 $(2,088)(11.4)%$2,400 15.1 %Net cash used in investing activities(5,047)(5,261)(5,534)214 4.1 %273 4.9 %Net cash used in financing activities(10,516)(11,356)(7,696)840 7.4 %(3,660)(47.6)%Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$614 $1,648 $2,635 $(1,034)(62.7)%$(987)(37.5)%Commentary - 2022 compared to 2021•Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory purchases.•Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $214 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments and the gross proceeds from the divestitures of PayFlex and bswift, largely offset by a reduction in restricted cash as a result of the sale of health savings account funds held on behalf of customers in conjunction with the sale of PayFlex. In addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity:•Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, approximately 73% of the Company’s total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 27% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements.•Net cash used in financing activities decreased to $10.5 billion in 2022 compared to $11.4 billion in 2021. The decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily related to lower net repayments of long-term debt during 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by share repurchases in 2022. Included in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was the following store development activity: (1)202220212020Total stores (beginning of year)9,939 9,962 9,896 New and acquired stores (2)41 58 156 Closed stores (2)(306)(81)(90)Total stores (end of year)9,674 9,939 9,962 Relocated stores (2)4 17 18 _____________________________________________(1)Includes retail drugstores and pharmacies within retail chains, primarily in Target Corporation (“Target”) stores.(2)Relocated stores are not included in new and acquired stores or closed stores totals.87Short-term BorrowingsCommercial Paper and Back-up Credit FacilitiesThe Company did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2025, a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 11, 2026, and a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2027. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company’s back-up credit facilities.Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”)A subsidiary of the Company is a member of the FHLBB. As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $915 million. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB.Long-term BorrowingsExercise of Par Call RedemptionsIn May 2022, the Company exercised the par call redemption on its outstanding 3.5% senior notes due July 2022 to redeem for cash on hand the entire $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount. In August 2022, the Company exercised the par call redemption on its outstanding 2.75% senior notes due November 2022 (issued by Aetna) to redeem for cash on hand the entire $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount.In September 2022, the Company exercised the par call redemptions on its outstanding 2.75% senior notes due December 2022 and 4.75% senior notes due December 2022 (including notes issued by Omnicare, Inc.) to redeem for cash on hand the entire aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion and $399 million, respectively.2021 NotesOn August 18, 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2031 for total proceeds of $987 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and offering expenses. The net proceeds of this offering were used for the purchase of senior notes in connection with the Company’s cash tender offer in August 2021 as described below.Cash Flow HedgesDuring March 2020, the Company entered into several interest rate swap transactions to manage interest rate risk. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the anticipated issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2027, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2030, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2040 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due April 1, 2050 (collectively, the “March 2020 Notes”). In connection with the issuance of the March 2020 Notes on March 31, 2020, the Company terminated all outstanding cash flow hedges. The Company paid a net amount of $7 million to the hedge counterparties upon termination, which was recorded as a loss, net of tax, of $5 million in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as interest expense over the life of the March 2020 Notes. See Note 13 ‘‘Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Early Extinguishments of DebtIn December 2021, the Company redeemed for cash the remaining $2.3 billion of its outstanding 3.7% senior notes due 2023. In connection with the early redemption of such senior notes, the Company paid a make-whole premium of $80 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were redeemed, wrote-off $8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $1 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $89 million.In August 2021, the Company purchased approximately $2.0 billion of its outstanding 4.3% senior notes due 2028 through a cash tender offer. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $332 million in excess 88of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $26 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $5 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $363 million.In December 2020, the Company purchased $4.5 billion of its outstanding senior notes through cash tender offers.

In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $706 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, wrote-off $47 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred $13 million in fees, for a total loss on early extinguishment of debt of $766 million.See Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances and debt repayments. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. Debt CovenantsThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see Note 8 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Debt Ratings As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s long-term debt was rated “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), and its commercial paper program was rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. The outlook on the Company’s long-term debt is “Stable” by Moody’s. In December 2022, S&P changed the outlook on the Company’s long-term debt from “Positive” to “Stable.” In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody’s and S&P considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot guarantee the future actions of Moody’s and/or S&P. The Company’s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. Share Repurchase ProgramsThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”):The following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the Board:In billionsAuthorization DateAuthorizedRemaining as ofDecember 31, 2022November 17, 2022 (“2022 Repurchase Program”)$10.0 $10.0 December 9, 2021 (“2021 Repurchase Program”)10.0 6.5 89Each of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the 2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time.During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 34.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 billion pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program, including share repurchases under the $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR transaction described below. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”). Upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 17.4 million shares at a price of $92.19 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2023. At the conclusion of the ASR, the Company may receive additional shares representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount. The ultimate number of shares the Company may receive will depend on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s stock over an averaging period, less a discount. It is also possible, depending on such weighted average price, that the Company will have an obligation to Citibank which, at the Company’s option, could be settled in additional cash or by issuing shares. Under the terms of the ASR, the maximum number of shares that could be delivered to the Company is 43.4 million.Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC. Upon payment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2022. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.2 billion and a forward contract for $0.3 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2022, the Company received approximately 2.7 million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2022.At the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.DividendsDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020 the quarterly cash dividend was $0.55, $0.50 and $0.50 per share, respectively. In December 2022, the Board authorized a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.605 per share effective in 2023. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.90Future Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2022, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at December 31, 2022 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

(5)Payments of other long-term liabilities exclude Separate Accounts liabilities of approximately $3.2 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business.(6)Total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $705 million, $1.3 billion and $170 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.(7)Customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $107 million have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unrealized capital losses on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $56 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.Restrictions on Certain PaymentsIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health Corporation as a holding company, since CVS Health Corporation is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’s debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. Under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $2.7 billion in the aggregate. The Company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable. 91At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held investments of $331 million and $450 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.Solvency RegulationThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2022, the RBC Ratio of each of the Company’s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2022, at that date, each of the Company’s active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.92Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.Revenue RecognitionHealth Care Benefits SegmentHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government business is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility. The Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the Company’s operating results.Premium RevenuePremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.Some of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.Services RevenueServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.93Accounting for Medicare Part D Revenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.Revenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.In addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.Revenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Pharmacy Services segment:•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.•Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.For contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.Drug DiscountsThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates 94payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.GuaranteesThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Retail/LTC SegmentRetail PharmacyThe Company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.Revenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.Customer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.Loyalty and Other ProgramsThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare®, consists of two components, ExtraSavingsTM and ExtraBucks® Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. ExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.The Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass®, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Long-term CareRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. 95Patient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.Walk-In Medical ClinicsFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.Impairments of Debt SecuritiesThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related (yield-related) components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.In evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. Among the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself, whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole, and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment’s current and short-term prospects for recovery. For unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the Company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. If either case is true, the Company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the cost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $143 million, $42 million and $49 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded credit-related losses on debt securities of $13 million. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record any credit-related impairment losses on debt securities. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.Vendor Allowances and Purchase DiscountsVendor and manufacturer receivables were $12.4 billion and $10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the majority of which relate to purchase discounts and vendor allowances as described below.Pharmacy Services SegmentThe Pharmacy Services segment receives purchase discounts on products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Pharmacy Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These 96rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Pharmacy Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Pharmacy Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.Retail/LTC SegmentVendor allowances received by the Retail/LTC segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any such allowances received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract.The Company establishes a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trends and data. The majority of vendor receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Historically, adjustments to the Company’s vendor receivables resulting from the reconciliation of receivables recognized to the amounts collected have not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.There have not been any material changes in the way the Company accounts for vendor allowances or purchase discounts during the past three years.InventoryInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.The value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and LTC pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The Company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.The total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $559 million and $522 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $56 million as of December 31, 2022.Although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.Right-of-Use Assets and Lease LiabilitiesThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the 97lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its right-of-use assets as described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below. The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Recoverability of Long-Lived AssetsRecoverability of Definite-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).The long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company undertook an initiative to evaluate its corporate office real estate space in response to its new flexible work arrangement. As part of this initiative, the Company evaluated its current real estate space and changes in employee work arrangement requirements to ensure it had the appropriate space to support the business. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that it would vacate and abandon certain leased corporate office spaces. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of $117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the Health Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on November 17, 2021, the Board authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately 300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups was lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately 98$1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the Retail/LTC segment. There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. Recoverability of GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company’s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives. 2022 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins.Subsequent to the closing date of the Aetna Acquisition in November 2018, the Company had experienced declines in its Commercial Insured medical membership. In 2022, the Company has grown its Commercial Insured medical membership, excluding the impact of the divestiture of the Thailand business described in Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Adverse economic conditions may impact medical membership in the Commercial business due to reductions in workforce at existing customers. The Company’s fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in medical membership, revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. The Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit in the third quarter of 2022 were reasonable and achievable. As of December 31, 2022, the goodwill balance in the Commercial Business reporting unit was $25.5 billion.2021 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%.As discussed in Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K, during 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company’s ability to grow the LTC reporting unit’s business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company’s long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third 99quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. Subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021, there is no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. 2020 Goodwill Impairment TestDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of this impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair values of all of the Company’s reporting units exceeding their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Commercial Business and LTC reporting units, which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6% and 12%, respectively.Recoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.Health Care Costs PayableAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, 75% of health care costs payable are estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. The remainder of health care costs payable is primarily comprised of pharmacy and capitation payables, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk sharing agreements and accruals for state assessments. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.During 2022 and 2021, the Company observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2022 and 2021 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 3 and 21 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $32 million and $207 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The Company has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2022. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 12 basis points from the Company’s assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $207 million pretax.Also, during 2022 and 2021, the Company observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2022 and 2021 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were 4.8% and 5.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $622 million and $581 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.Management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2022, the Company increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 4.9% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Health care cost trend rates during the past three years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies 100experiencing utilization impacts due to COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $487 million pretax.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently uncertain.Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. The Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.101Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk.Evaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality RiskThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.InvestmentsThe Company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2022 and 2021:In millions20222021Experience-rated products $744 $957 Remaining products23,147 25,185 Total investments (1)$23,891 $26,142 _____________________________________________(1)Includes long-term investments of $17 million which have been accounted for as assets held for sale and are included in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.Investment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.The debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, with a fair value of approximately $6.0 billion and $6.7 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (of which 1.6% and 2.0% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, supported experience-rated products).At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held $202 million and $305 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing 1% of total investments at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA+ and AA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).The Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America). See Note 4 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 3 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.The Company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, 102the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.Evaluation of Market Valuation RisksThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.Assuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2022 is as follows:•The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $2.9 billion ($3.6 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.•The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $595 million ($750 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-rated products. Reductions in the fair value of investment securities would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt securities as available for sale. The Company does not record liabilities at fair value.If the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $20 million ($26 million pretax).Based on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2022.Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity RiskAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.Evaluation of Operational RisksThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and risks related to information security, including cybersecurity. The spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate its spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate our businesses effectively, including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages. Disruptions in our supply chains, our distribution chains and/or public and private infrastructure, including communications, financial services and supply chains, could materially and adversely impact our business operations. We have transitioned a significant subset of our colleagues to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as have a 103significant number of our third-party service providers, which may amplify certain risks to our businesses, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cyber attacks, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our medical members or other third-parties and increased risk of business interruptions.The Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyber attacks and expect to continue to experience cyber attacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyber attacks has not been material to the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2022. The Board and its Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are regularly informed regarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status.104Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:05:29.738292

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk During the third quarter of 2006, the Company refinanced a portion of the short-term borrowings issued to finance the acquisition of the Standalone Drug Business, with $800 million of 5.75% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2011 and $700 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2016. To manage a portion of the risk associated 21 with changes in market interest rates, during the second quarter of 2006, the Company entered into forward starting pay fixed rate swaps (the “Swaps”), with a notional amount of $750 million. The Swaps settled during the third quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the placement of the longer-term financing. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had no freestanding derivatives in place. In consideration of the execution of the share repurchase upon consummation of the merger with Caremark, the Company expects to enter into a $1.25 billion, five-year unsecured back-up credit facility. In addition the Company anticipates entering into a facility, which will act as a bridge facility, with a value of $5.0 billion. The Company expects the bridge facility will terminate upon the placement of longer-term financing.
