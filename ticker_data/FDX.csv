1048911,FDX,FEDEX CORP,2002,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition GENERAL The following management’s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies, of FedEx Corporation (also referred to as “FedEx”). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements, which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results. FedEx is one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units. These business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments: FedEx Express, the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground, North America’s second largest provider of small-package ground delivery service; and FedEx Freight, the largest U.S. provider of regional less-than-truckload freight services. The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks, as measured by our average daily volume; the mix of services purchased by our customers; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by average price per shipment (yield); our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits, fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels. Except as otherwise indicated, references to years mean our fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 or ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following table compares revenues, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2002 2001(1) 2000 2002/ 2001 2001/ 2000 Revenues $ 20,607 $ 19,629 $ 18,257 + 5 +8 Operating income 1,321 1,071 1,221 +23 -12 Net income 710 584 688 +22 -15 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.34 $ 1.99 $ 2.32 +18 -14 (1) Results for 2001 include noncash charges of $102 million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at FedEx Express and a $22 million reorganization charge at FedEx Supply Chain Services. These charges were $78 million after tax or $.27 per diluted share. Our 2002 results reflect outstanding revenue and earnings growth at FedEx Ground. Operating income at this segment increased $162 million or 93%, reflecting volume growth in FedEx Ground’s core business and reduced losses in its home delivery service. The performance of FedEx Ground, and the addition of FedEx Freight East (formerly known as American Freightways) in the third quarter of 2001, contributed to improved net income for 2002, but were mitigated by continued softness in package volumes at FedEx Express. Volume levels in our FedEx Express domestic and international package services declined in 2002 as a result of continued weakness in the U.S. and global economies (particularly 37 Table of Contents in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors), which has decreased demand for our higher-priced express services. Revenue from our transportation agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”), which commenced in the first quarter of 2002, as well as effective cost management, helped soften the impact of reduced package volumes at FedEx Express. Largely due to the contributions of FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and the fact that 2001 included approximately $124 million in noncash charges (discussed below), operating income increased significantly in 2002. Discretionary spending (such as professional fees and travel-related expenses) was reduced approximately $108 million during 2002. Pension costs were approximately $90 million higher in 2002, due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets. Variable compensation was slightly higher in 2002. During 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel, respectively. Lower fuel prices during 2002 had a positive impact on operating expenses; however, declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income. Conversely, fuel surcharge revenue in 2001 more than offset the impact of higher fuel costs. During 2001, increased fuel prices negatively impacted year-over-year expenses by approximately $160 million, net of the effects of jet fuel hedging contracts. We received approximately $92 million in 2001 under jet fuel hedging contracts, which we effectively closed during the fourth quarter of 2001 by entering into offsetting contracts. The maturity of these contracts increased 2002 fuel costs by approximately $15 million. Net income for 2002 reflects the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in the first quarter. This change resulted from adoption of new rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (see Note 2 and Note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements). Adoption of these new rules resulted in the first quarter recognition of a $25 million ($15 million net of tax or $.05 per share) impairment charge to our recorded goodwill. Results for 2002 also reflect the cessation of $36 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses, as required under the new accounting rules. Goodwill amortization expense was $26 million for 2001 and $17 million for 2000. Our results for 2001 reflected strong performance during the first half, which was more than offset by the effects of weakened economic conditions in the second half of the year. As a result of lower domestic volumes at FedEx Express in the second half of 2001 and lowered capacity growth forecasts, management committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our MD10 program (which upgrades and modifies our older DC10 aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer MD11 aircraft). By curtailing the MD10 program, we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through 2008. During 2001, we also took actions to reorganize our FedEx Supply Chain Services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable, non-strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead. In addition, due to the bankruptcy of Ayres Corporation, we wrote off deposits and related items in 2001 in connection with the Ayres ALM200 aircraft program. Following is a summary of these charges (in millions): Impairment of certain assets related to the MD10 aircraft program $ 93 Strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary 22 Ayres program write-off 9 Total $124 Results for 2002 were favorably affected by approximately $12 million, related to the charges above, based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates. No material amounts remained on the balance sheet for these items at the end of 2002. 38 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2001 and 2000, revenues increased slightly in 2001, reflecting revenue growth of FedEx International Priority® (“IP”) packages. During 2001, volume growth was higher at FedEx Ground as this subsidiary continued to grow its core business and expand its new home delivery service offering. The effects of the acquisition of FedEx Freight East added approximately $630 million to 2001 revenues. The acquisition resulted in recognition of approximately $600 million in goodwill and was slightly accretive to 2001 earnings per diluted share. For further information regarding this acquisition, see “Liquidity” and Note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements. Our 2001 operating results reflected the continuing implementation of the rebranding and reorganization initiatives begun in the last half of 2000 to leverage the FedEx name and centralize certain sales, marketing and technology functions of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground into FedEx Services (see “Reportable Segments” below). These rebranding costs did not have a significant impact on 2002 results and were approximately $26 million for 2001 and $21 million for 2000. Our 2001 results included a significant reduction in operating costs related to reduced provisions under our variable compensation plans. Pension costs were approximately $70 million lower in 2001, due principally to higher discount rates. Other Income and Expense and Income Taxes Interest expense was slightly lower in 2002, as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year (see “Financial Condition” below). Financing for the acquisition of FedEx Freight East, which was completed in the third quarter of 2001, was the principal reason net interest expense was 36% higher in 2001. In 2002, other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately $17 million from the retirement of debt assumed in the FedEx Freight East acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations. Other nonoperating expenses in 2000 included gains of approximately $12 million from an insurance settlement for a destroyed MD11 aircraft and approximately $11 million from the sale of securities. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2002, 37.0% in 2001 and 39.5% in 2000. The 37.5% effective tax rate in 2002 was higher than the 2001 effective rate primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in 2001. The 2002 rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization (as discussed above) and by several other factors, none of which were individually significant. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes. For 2003, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. At May 31, 2002, we had a net deferred tax liability of $130 million, consisting of $1 billion of deferred tax assets and $1.1 billion of deferred tax liabilities. The reversal of deferred tax assets in future periods is expected to be offset by similar amounts of deferred tax liabilities. Terrorist Attacks of September 11 Fiscal 2002 second quarter operations were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. All domestic FedEx Express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on September 11 and 12, and flight operations resumed on the evening of September 13, 2001. During the period our aircraft were grounded, both domestic and international shipments were impacted, with domestic average daily express volumes declining almost 50% from prior year levels. We executed contingency plans and transported all domestic shipments during this period through ground-based 39 Table of Contents trucking operations. We resumed air operations within hours of receiving clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration. Business levels at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight were not materially affected. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the U.S. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the “Act”), an emergency economic assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the nation’s air carriers. The Act provides for $5 billion to be used for financial assistance to airlines to offset losses caused by service disruptions and declines in business activity related to these attacks for the period September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2001. The Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued EITF 01-10, “Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001,” in September 2001 to establish accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Under EITF 01-10, federal assistance provided to air carriers in the form of direct compensation from the U.S. government under the Act should be recognized when the related losses are incurred and compensation under the Act is probable. We recognized $119 million of compensation under the Act in 2002. We have classified all amounts recognized under this program (of which $101 million was received as of May 31, 2002) as a reduction of operating expenses under the caption “Airline stabilization compensation.” While we believe we have complied with all aspects of the Act and that it is probable we will ultimately receive the remaining $18 million receivable, compensation previously recognized is subject to audit and interpretation by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). We have received requests from the DOT for additional information in support of our claims under the Act and have responded fully to these requests. We cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome of such interpretations, but it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the amount of compensation recognized by us under the Act could occur. Although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming, as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may have on our results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, we are not certain how the events of September 11, or any subsequent terrorist activities, will ultimately impact the U.S. and global economies in general, and the air transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs or on the demand for our services. Outlook On May 31, 2002, we announced our first-ever payment of a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $.05 per share. We expect to continue these quarterly cash dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. The economic downturn that began in calendar 2001 provided opportunities for management teams within the FedEx family to examine growth strategies and take steps to right-size our transportation networks, improve service and provide choices to fit our customers’ transportation needs. We believe we are well positioned for long-term growth when the economy, particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, recovers and experiences sustained growth. For 2003, we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of an economic stabilization during the first half of 2003 and a recovery during the remainder of the year are realized. 40 Table of Contents Our diverse portfolio of services is the key factor to our long-term growth. The expansion of FedEx Ground’s home delivery network and continued development and cross-selling of the diverse FedEx portfolio of services, particularly to small- and medium-sized businesses, is central to our strategy. Our Web site, fedex.com, is heavily utilized and has helped us reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Management believes that our substantially fixed cost infrastructure will allow us to realize incremental profits when the economy recovers. Pension costs are expected to continue to increase over the near term. Our pension cost for 2003 will increase by approximately $90 million due to lower interest rates in 2002 and the effects of decreased returns on pension plan assets. For 2003, we will lower our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 10.9% to 10.1%. While employee retirement costs continue to rise, our retirement programs are well funded, with assets sufficient to meet our current obligations. Maintenance costs are expected to be higher in 2003 due to scheduled maintenance activities. Higher group health and other insurance costs are also anticipated. In spite of the impact of these increased expenses, we expect our operating margin to slightly improve as a result of continued focus on cost reductions (including hiring restrictions and reduced discretionary spending), productivity improvements and a reduction in the FedEx Home Delivery loss. Actual results for 2003 will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the economic recovery, our ability to match capacity with volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives. In addition, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before the surcharges are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for a more complete description of potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future performance. Seasonality of Business Our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday sales. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods. The transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom Critical, while the latter part of December, January, June and July of each year are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of December, January and February of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” in June 2001 and SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” in October 2001. These statements will be effective for FedEx beginning in 2003. We do not expect the application of these new accounting standards to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 41 Table of Contents REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, each of which operates in a single line of business. Included within “Other” are the operations of FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx Services. “Other” also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations. Management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income. The formation of FedEx Services at the beginning of 2001 represented the implementation of a business strategy that combined the sales, marketing and information technology functions of our FedEx Express and FedEx Ground reportable segments to form a shared services company that supports the package businesses of both of these segments. FedEx Services provides our customers with a single point of contact for all express and ground services. Prior to the formation of FedEx Services, each business had its own self-contained sales, marketing and information technology functions. The costs for these activities are now allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided. These allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions. The line item “Intercompany charges” on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx Services to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, and certain other costs such as corporate management fees.

See “Reportable Segments” above. (2) The U.S. overnight box category includes packages exceeding 8 ounces in weight. (3) The U.S. overnight envelope category includes envelopes weighing 8 ounces or less. (4) 2001 includes a $93 million charge for impairment of the MD10 aircraft program and a $9 million charge for the Ayres program write-off. FedEx Express Revenues Volumes at FedEx Express continue to be below levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown, which began in 2001. Volumes were also significantly impacted by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. All domestic FedEx Express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on September 11 and 12, and flight operations resumed on the evening of September 13, 2001. Both domestic and international shipments were impacted by this event. During 2002, total package revenue decreased 6%, principally due to decreases in volumes. In the United States, package revenue declined 7% (on 6% lower average daily domestic express package volume, principally in U.S. overnight box and envelope volumes). While IP volume decreased slightly in 2002, principally due to a decline in U.S. outbound shipments, IP volumes were positively impacted by the European and Asian economies, although volumes in these markets did not grow as much as in 2001. For 2002, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 15% and 5% in the European and Asian markets, respectively. Package yields are slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. In the second quarter of 2002, we implemented a new index for determining our fuel surcharge. Using this new index, the fuel surcharge ranged between 0% and 3% from November 2001 through May 2002. The fuel surcharge during all of 2001 was 4%. In 2001, total package revenue increased 5%, principally due to increases in yields and IP volumes. The increase in yields in 2001 was a result of yield-management, which included limiting growth of less profitable business and recovering the higher cost of fuel through a fuel surcharge. Domestic rate 43 Table of Contents increases in February 2001 also contributed to the higher yield during 2001. While the IP volume growth was 8% for 2001, this rate was impacted by a year-over-year increase in U.S. outbound shipments, offset by weakness in the Asian economy in the last half of the year. For 2001, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 24% in the European market and 12% in the Asian market. Total freight revenue for 2002 increased significantly due to improved domestic freight volume and yield, reflecting the impact of the USPS transportation agreement, which began in August 2001. On January 10, 2001, FedEx Express and the USPS entered into two service contracts: one for domestic air transportation and the other for placement of FedEx Drop Boxes at U.S. Post Offices. On December 13, 2001, we signed an addendum to our transportation agreement with the USPS, effective for a 10-month period beginning January 1, 2002, which allows us to carry incremental pounds of mail at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement. In 2001, total freight revenue increased slightly over 2000 due to significantly improved yields in U.S. freight, partially offset by declines in domestic freight volume and international freight volume and yield. Other revenue (which includes Canadian domestic revenue, charter services, logistics services, sales of hushkits and other) increased 10% in 2002. In 2001 and 2000, other revenue decreased, mostly due to declines in the sale of hushkits. Hushkits sales were insignificant in 2002. FedEx Express Operating Income In 2002, operating income at FedEx Express decreased 4%. Excluding $102 million of asset impairment charges taken in 2001, operating income was down 15% in 2002. Revenue declines in 2002 on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions. During 2002, contractual reimbursements received from the USPS substantially offset network expansion costs incurred (principally in increased salaries). USPS reimbursements during 2002 are reflected as a credit to other operating expenses. This reimbursement, however, had no effect on operating income, as it represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred. In 2002, FedEx Express recognized $27 million of operating income from the resolution of certain state tax matters, which is also reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses. Operating income for 2002 also reflects the adoption of new rules from the FASB for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (as discussed in “Consolidated Results” above). For FedEx Express, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $12 million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 (this amortization amount is comparable to 2001 and 2000). Rentals and landing fees were higher in 2002 primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental domestic freight volume. While fuel usage was higher in 2002 due to incremental freight pounds transported under the USPS agreement, fuel costs were down, as the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel decreased 12% in 2002. During 2001, increased fuel expense reflected a 17% increase in average jet fuel price per gallon, which contributed to a negative impact of approximately $150 million, including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts entered into to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs. For 2002, salaries, wages and benefits were higher in spite of reductions in hours and full-time equivalents, which were not sufficient to offset base salary increases and higher pension and medical costs. This is partially because a significant portion of incremental cost increases related to the USPS contract is reflected in salaries and wages. Pension costs at FedEx Express were approximately $60 million higher in 2002. Profit sharing and incentive compensation provisions were down significantly for 2002. 44 Table of Contents In 2001, operating income decreased 6%, reflecting charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter (see “Consolidated Results” above). Excluding these charges, operating income increased 5% in 2001, despite a slowdown in revenue growth that year, as reduced variable compensation and pension costs, coupled with intensified cost controls over discretionary spending, had a positive impact. Declining contributions from sales of hushkits negatively impacted operating profit by $40 million in 2001. FedEx Express Outlook While we believe economic growth during the first half of 2003 will be slow, particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, we expect revenue to increase during 2003, in both the domestic and international markets. Revenue growth is expected to exceed expense growth due to increases in both domestic and international package volumes and yield. Operating margin for this segment is expected to increase in 2003 despite increasing pension and health care costs, insurance expenses, maintenance costs and costs associated with annual wage increases. Our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued cost control efforts, with a particular focus on significant improvements in productivity and transportation network efficiency. We will also benefit in 2003 from a full year of operations under our transportation contract with the USPS. Although fuel price increases are anticipated during 2003, they are not expected to significantly impact earnings as our fuel surcharge is closely linked to prevailing market prices for jet fuel. Our fuel surcharge has a lag that exists before it is adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. FEDEX GROUND The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2002 2001 2000(1) 2002/ 2001 2001/ 2000 Revenues $ 2,711 $ 2,237 $ 2,033 +21 +10 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 532 450 +18 Purchased transportation 1,032 881 +17 Rentals 71 67 +6 Depreciation and amortization 132 111 +19 Fuel 4 8 -50 Maintenance and repairs 73 63 +16 Intercompany charges 238 215 +11 Other 292 267 +9 Total operating expenses 2,374 2,062 1,807 +15 +14 Operating income $ 337 $ 175 $ 226 +93 -23 Average daily packages 1,755 1,520 1,442 +15 +5 Revenue per package (yield) $ 6.11 $ 5.79 $ 5.55 +6 +4 (1) Operating expense detail for 2000 has been omitted, as this data is not comparable. See “Reportable Segments” above. 45 Table of Contents FedEx Ground Revenues Core business growth and the increasing popularity of our new home delivery service helped FedEx Ground realize double-digit revenue growth in both 2002 and 2001, as volumes and yields increased. Sales and marketing activities have been effective in attracting new small- and medium-sized customers, which generate higher yielding package revenues. For 2002 and 2001, the increase in average daily packages represents positive volume growth experienced in all principal markets served by FedEx Ground, including FedEx Home Delivery, which added facilities to reach almost 90% coverage of the U.S. population. In 2002 and 2001, year-over-year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases, ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages. In the third quarter of 2002, we implemented a new dynamic fuel surcharge, which is indexed to the current price of diesel fuel. Using this new index, the fuel surcharge ranged between .50% and .75% from February through May 2002. A 1.25% fuel surcharge was in effect for most of 2001. FedEx Ground Operating Income FedEx Ground’s operating income significantly increased in 2002 primarily due to package volume growth, higher yields, productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management. FedEx Home Delivery had a loss of $32 million in 2002, which is a significant improvement from the loss in 2001. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in increased depreciation, rental and other property-related expenses during 2002. Salaries, wages and benefits also were higher in 2002 due to additional full-time equivalents and higher pension and medical costs. Costs for our variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during 2002, reflecting FedEx Ground’s outstanding financial performance. During 2001, operating income decreased 23%, primarily due to a FedEx Home Delivery operating loss of $52 million and rebranding and reorganization expenses of $15 million. The rebranding and reorganization expenses consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans, trailers and signage. Such costs were expensed as incurred. Excluding the negative impact of these expenses, operating income decreased 2% from 2000. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in higher depreciation, rental and other property-related expenses during 2001. FedEx Home Delivery, launched in March 2000, negatively affected 2000 operating income by approximately $19 million. FedEx Ground Outlook For 2003, volumes and yield are expected to grow in both the core business and FedEx Home Delivery. FedEx Ground will continue expansion of the FedEx Home Delivery network to serve nearly 100% of the U.S. population by mid-September 2002. Plans for 2003 will be focused on improvements in on-time delivery, productivity and safety. Total operating profit for FedEx Ground is expected to improve over 2002, although we expect operating margin to decrease because FedEx Ground will absorb a larger portion of allocated sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs during 2003. During 2003, we expect the operating loss from FedEx Home Delivery to improve, with this service becoming profitable sometime in 2004. 46 Table of Contents FEDEX FREIGHT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income (in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31: 2002 2001(1) Revenues $ 1,960 $ 835 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,170 489 Purchased transportation 57 23 Rentals 64 27 Depreciation and amortization 86 44 Fuel 72 41 Maintenance and repairs 90 39 Intercompany charges 8 1 Other 245 116 Total operating expenses 1,792 780 Operating income $ 168 $ 55 Shipments per day(2) 56,000 56,012 Weight per shipment (lbs)(2) 1,114 1,132 Revenue per hundredweight(2) $ 12.41 $ 11.83 (1) Results for 2001 include the financial results of FedEx Freight West from December 1, 2000 and of FedEx Freight East from January 1, 2001 (the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes). Therefore, 2001 results are not comparable to 2002. (2) Statistics for 2001 are based on portion of the year including both FedEx Freight West and FedEx Freight East (January through May). Although revenues were higher in 2002 due to the inclusion of a full year of operations, revenues were impacted by lower than expected volumes, due to the economic slowdown, and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge. The FedEx Freight fuel surcharge is tied to the “Retail on Highway Diesel Fuel Price,” as published by the U.S. Department of Energy, and changes weekly based on changes in the index. In 2002, average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year, weight per shipment was down 2% and revenue per hundredweight was up 5%. During this difficult economic environment, FedEx Freight improved yields and managed costs. Operating margins were 8.6% in 2002, reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization and stable pricing, partially offset by the impact of $6 million of rebranding expenses, primarily for tractors and trailers. Our focus on providing superior service to attract and maintain customers solidified our leadership position in the regional less-than-truckload (“LTL”) market. Operating income for FedEx Freight in 2002 reflects the adoption of new rules from the FASB for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (as discussed in “Consolidated Results” above). For FedEx Freight, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $15 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002. For 2001, goodwill amortization recorded by FedEx Freight was $6 million, reflecting the acquisition of FedEx Freight East in January 2001. FedEx Freight Outlook We announced in February 2002 that FedEx Freight East (formerly known as American Freightways) and FedEx Freight West (formerly known as Viking Freight) are being rebranded under the name “FedEx Freight.” We believe this will allow us to take advantage of the FedEx brand and create additional synergies, which will give us a competitive advantage and continue to improve our market share in the LTL segment. The rebranding expenses will consist primarily of incremental external costs 47 Table of Contents for rebranding tractors and trailers, which will be expensed as incurred. The cost of the rebranding is expected to increase FedEx Freight’s operating expenses by approximately $15 million in 2003. We expect a total of approximately $40 to $45 million to be spent on rebranding at FedEx Freight through 2005. The complementary geographic regions served by FedEx Freight East and FedEx Freight West are expected to have a positive impact on results of operations for this segment. Both companies will continue to focus on day-definite regional LTL service, but will also collaborate to serve customers who have multiregional LTL needs. In June 2002 we announced a series of new premium service offerings, including optional money-back guaranteed transit times in the West and expanded next-day coverage up to 900 miles in selected lanes in the East. These new service offerings will provide our customers with additional shipping options. On June 27, 2002, we announced a general rate increase of 5.9% to be effective July 22, 2002. Yield management, enhanced productivity and cost-control measures continue to be major focus areas for FedEx Freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment. OTHER OPERATIONS Other operations include FedEx Custom Critical, a critical-shipment carrier; FedEx Trade Networks, whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company; FedEx Services, a provider of supply chain management services and sales, marketing and IT support for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground; and certain unallocated corporate items. Also included in this category are the operating results of FedEx Freight West prior to December 1, 2000. Revenues from other operations were $609 million (down 40%) in 2002 compared to $1.0 billion in 2001 and $1.2 billion in 2000. During 2002, a significant portion of the decrease in revenues reflects the fact that current year results for this category no longer include FedEx Freight West’s revenues (see “FedEx Freight” above). In both 2002 and 2001, revenues at FedEx Custom Critical were down 24%, largely due to the economic downturn. The demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary (critical shipments) is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators, principally in the automotive industry, where volumes have been depressed since calendar 2001. Operating income from other operations was $5 million in 2002 compared to an operating loss of $6 million in 2001 and operating income of $95 million in 2000. The improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflects reduced operating costs at FedEx Supply Chain Services. The decrease in operating income in 2001 over 2000 reflects the effect of the economic slowdown on FedEx Custom Critical during 2001 (which had strong earnings growth in 2000) and lower performance of FedEx Supply Chain Services. Operating income in 2000 had strong earnings from FedEx Freight West and also included a $10 million favorable adjustment related to estimated future lease costs from a 1997 restructuring at FedEx Freight West. On March 1, 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc., which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations at a cost of $36.5 million. 48 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies, and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent auditors. REVENUE RECOGNITION We believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing a company’s overall financial performance, and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace. Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments. Our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational, billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and collect amounts due to us. We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or, for our logistics and trade services businesses, upon the completion of services. In addition, transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period: (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. We use the second method; we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred. There are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above: (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts. Unbilled Revenue. Primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers, there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice. At the end of a month, unprocessed invoices may be as much as one-third of the total month’s revenue. This revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes. Most of these accruals are represented by invoices that are essentially complete, with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued. The remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced. Because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes, the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced. 49 Table of Contents Shipments in Process. The majority of our shipments have short cycle times and therefore less than 5% of a total month’s revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period. At month-end, we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our average price for the respective services. We believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period. Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts Receivable. Like many companies, we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable. Historically, our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective. We also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing corrections. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts, adjustments processed, and current collections trends. Allowances for these future adjustments aggregated $147 million at May 31, 2002 and $137 million at May 31, 2001. We consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances. PENSION COST We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees. The accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates, which include: employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages; discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; and future salary increases. We consider the most critical of these to be our discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long-term rate of return is applied) and the rate of future increases in salaries. For FedEx, many of these assumptions are highly sensitive in the determination of a year’s pension cost because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans. For example, fewer than 5% of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits. Therefore, the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future. This long-time period increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our pension cost. Total pension costs increased approximately $90 million in 2002 and are expected to increase an additional $90 million in 2003. Discount Rate. This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value (defined as the projected benefit obligation). The discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date (February 28) and affects the succeeding year’s pension cost. A decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive, as a one-basis-point change in the discount rate affects our pension expense by approximately $1 million. For example, the 60-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 7.1% for 2002 from 7.7% for 2001 will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately $60 million. 50 Table of Contents We determine the discount rate (which is meant to be the current rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments. This methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity. However, the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds. Plan Assets. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. With over $5.5 billion of plan assets, a one-basis-point change in this assumption directly affects pension cost by approximately $600,000 (a decrease in the assumed expected long-term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense). Our 2002 expected long-term rate of return of 10.9% reflects our active investment management program, which has consistently outperformed the related market indices over the past ten years. Also, because of our relatively young workforce, we are able to maintain more of our pension assets invested in higher-returning, longer-term equity investments. While plan investments are subject to short-term volatility, they are well diversified and the asset portfolios are closely managed. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly. Based on recent trends in asset performance and generally lower risk premiums in equity markets, we lowered the expected long-term rate of return for 2003 to 10.1%. This 80-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately $48 million. Further adjustments to this estimate may be necessary in the future. Investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long-term rate of return is applied, which will further increase our pension cost in 2003. Despite poor asset performance over the past two years that has generated investment losses, our pension plan is and will continue to be appropriately funded to meet the payment of benefits as such obligations become due. Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated value method, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases). The application of this accounting policy reduced 2002 pension cost by approximately $16 million. Salary Increases. The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost. We correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages). A one-basis-point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately $700,000 (a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost). Thus, the decrease in the assumption to 3.3% at the end of 2002 from 4.0% will favorably impact 2003 pension cost by approximately $50 million. SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accident and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee health care programs. At May 31, 2002 we had total self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet of approximately $839 million ($776 million at May 31, 2001). The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily 51 Table of Contents through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in health costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Property and Equipment. Our key businesses are capital intensive. Over 60% of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred. The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (over 20 years for certain of our aircraft equipment), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated lives or salvage values are necessary. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than $10 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future based on technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory requirements, and other factors beyond our control. Because we must plan for future volume levels for multiple years in order to make commitments for aircraft based on those projections, we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of capacity needs, and those decisions may result in an impairment. For example, in 2001 we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at FedEx Express related to our MD10 conversion program. The decision allowed us to avoid approximately $1.1 billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of $93 million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated disposal value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal. During 2002 we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired MD10 program assets, which resulted in a favorable adjustment of $9 million. Leases. We utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft. Over the years, we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in “Contractual Cash Obligations” below and Note 7 to the 52 Table of Contents accompanying audited financial statements, at May 31, 2002 we had approximately $15 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for operating leases. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation. Goodwill. We have in excess of $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses. New accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization. As previously indicated, the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of $25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses. The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values. Changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates. However, once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY We reached a significant milestone in 2002, as we declared our first-ever cash dividend. On May 31, 2002, we announced that shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2002 will be paid a $.05 cash dividend per share of common stock. We expect to continue these quarterly dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $331 million at May 31, 2002, compared to $121 million at May 31, 2001. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,228 $ 2,044 $ 1,625 Cash used in investing activities: Capital investments and other (1,577 ) (1,636 ) (1,451 ) Business acquisitions (35 ) (477 ) (257 ) Free cash flow 616 (69 ) (83 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (406 ) 122 (174 ) Increase (decrease) in cash $ 210 $ 53 $ (257 ) 53 Table of Contents The following cash-based measure is presented as an additional means of evaluating our financial condition because we incur significant noncash charges, including depreciation and amortization, related to the material capital assets utilized in our business. This measure should not be considered as a superior alternative to net income, operating income, cash from operations, or any other operating or liquidity performance measure as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following table compares EBITDA, as adjusted (earnings before goodwill accounting changes, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the years ended May 31 (in billions): 2002 2001 2000 EBITDA, as adjusted $ 2.7 $ 2.3 $ 2.4 The increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2002 reflects increases in EBITDA, as adjusted (which includes FedEx Freight for an entire year) and aggressive working capital management. In 2001, the addition of FedEx Freight East improved cash provided by operating activities for that year. Cash Used for Capital Investments. Capital expenditures during 2002 were lower, primarily at FedEx Express where capital expenditures were 14% lower due to our efforts at the end of 2001 to match our planned spending with anticipated volume levels. We have taken various actions to reduce future capital expenditures over the past two years, including those related to the curtailment of our MD10 program (discussed in “Consolidated Results” above) and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase 19 MD11 aircraft from an affiliate of SAirGroup. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately $2.1 billion in future capital expenditures. During 2002, we continued to make investments in FedEx Ground’s infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand FedEx Freight. See “Capital Resources” below for further discussion. Cash Used for Business Acquisitions. During 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc. that provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations. During 2001, we acquired FedEx Freight East for approximately $980 million with a combination of cash and FedEx common stock. During 2000, we acquired three businesses for approximately $264 million, primarily in cash. See Note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of business combinations. Free Cash Flow. Cash flow from operations during 2002 exceeded our cash used for investing activities creating free cash flow of $616 million, with which we paid off over $300 million in debt and repurchased treasury shares. The achievement of positive free cash flow is attributable to management of capital expenditures and working capital. Positive free cash flow indicates excess funds are available to invest in operations, reduce outstanding debt and provide return on capital to our shareholders. Debt Financing Activities. At April 1, 2002, certain existing debt at FedEx Express matured, principally $175 million of 9.875% Senior Notes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we prepaid the remaining $101 million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of FedEx Freight East. In the third quarter of 2001, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches: three, five and ten years, at $250 million each. Net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness, principally borrowings under our commercial paper program, and for general corporate purposes. These notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations. 54 Table of Contents We currently have $1 billion in revolving bank credit facilities that are generally used to finance temporary operating cash requirements and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of May 31, 2002, we had no commercial paper outstanding and the entire credit facilities were available. For more information regarding these credit facilities, see Note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements. During 2002, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing. Under this shelf registration statement we may issue, in one or more offerings, either unsecured debt securities, common stock, or a combination of such instruments. Cash Used for Share Repurchases. We repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock in 2002, at a cost of approximately $177 million, under our 5.0 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to buy back an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock. There were no treasury share repurchases during 2001 and, during 2000, cash flows were affected by approximately $607 million from the repurchase of 15 million shares. Other Liquidity Information. We will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to achieve positive free cash flow in the future. We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems. In recent years, we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Trade Networks. The sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until 2002. With the infrastructure and operating systems now largely in place, we have been able to reduce our capital spending, including equivalent capital (as defined below), since 2000. Despite the decrease in capital spending, our operations remain capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment, package-handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including preexisting contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities. The following table compares capital expenditures (including equivalent capital) for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Aircraft and related equipment $ 730 $ 756 $ 469 Facilities and sort equipment 292 353 437 Information and technology investments 240 406 378 Vehicles and other equipment 353 378 343 Total capital expenditures 1,615 1,893 1,627 Equivalent capital, principallyaircraft-related — — 365 Total $ 1,615 $ 1,893 $ 1,992 (See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment.) 55 Table of Contents In 2002, in spite of capital spending related to the 2001 addition of FedEx Freight East, as well as scheduled deliveries of aircraft that were planned and committed to well before the economic slowdown, management’s cost-reduction actions resulted in a decrease in capital spending compared to both 2001 and 2000. For 2003, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.9 billion, as we are required to take 17 aircraft committed to in prior years. Because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft, we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance. Therefore, we must make projections regarding our needed airlift capacity many years before aircraft are actually needed. We will continue to manage our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels, and defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible in order to achieve positive cash flow. On July 12, 2002, FedEx Express entered into an agreement with AVSA, S.A.R.L. for the purchase of ten Airbus A380-800F aircraft, a new high-capacity, long-range airplane. We expect to take delivery of three of the ten aircraft in each of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and the remaining one in 2011. The total commitment under the agreement approximates $2 billion. Most of the purchase price of each aircraft is due upon delivery of the aircraft. The agreement also provides for an option to purchase an additional ten aircraft. We have historically financed our long-term capital investments through the use of lease, debt and equity financing in addition to the use of internally generated cash from operations. The determination to lease versus buy equipment is a financing decision, and all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital. The amount we would have expended to purchase these assets had we not chosen to obtain their use through operating leases (leases with terms in excess of 50% of the asset’s useful life) is considered equivalent capital in the table above and is included in our internal capital budget. We had no equivalent capital expenditures during 2002 or 2001. We finance a significant amount of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of “off-balance sheet financing”). Certain of these operating leases were arranged using special purpose entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry. At the time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after-tax cash flows. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements as well as in “Contractual Cash Obligations” below. Credit rating agencies routinely use the information concerning our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. Furthermore, our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases. In the future, other forms of secured financing may be pursued to finance aircraft acquisitions if we determine that it best suits our needs. We have been successful in obtaining investment capital, both domestic and international, for long-term leases on acceptable terms, although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs.

Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

(4) Does not include commitments made on July 12, 2002 for purchase of Airbus A380 aircraft. In addition, we have other commercial commitments incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required under certain self-insurance programs. While the notional amounts of these instruments are material, there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the liabilities for these self-insurance programs are already reflected in our balance sheet as accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. We also have guarantees, amounting to $137 million at May 31, 2002, under certain operating leases for the residual values of aircraft, vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods. These guarantees are not reflected in our balance sheet since they are not currently considered probable; therefore, they do not represent liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION Since the beginning of the European Union’s transition to the euro on January 1, 1999, our subsidiaries have been prepared to quote rates to customers, generate billings and accept payments, in both euro and legacy currencies. The legacy currencies remained legal tender through January 1, 2002. We did not experience a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows from the introduction of the euro and any price transparency brought about by its introduction and the phasing out of the legacy currencies. Costs associated with the euro project were expensed as incurred and were funded entirely by internal cash flows. 57 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Report (including the information incorporated by reference in this Report) contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of FedEx. Forward-looking statements include those preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates” or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, because of, among other things, potential risks and uncertainties, such as: • the impact of the events of September 11, 2001, or any subsequent terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, or the transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs or the demand for our services; • economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the economy’s recovery from the downturn that began in calendar 2001 in the sectors that drive demand for our services; • our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses and match them, especially those relating to aircraft, vehicle and sort capacity, to shifting customer volume levels; • market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives, including our residential home delivery service; • sudden changes in fuel prices; • the timing and amount of any money we are entitled to receive under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act; • competition from other providers of transportation and logistics services; • our ability to compete with new or improved services offered by our competitors; • changes in customer demand patterns; • our ability to obtain and maintain aviation rights in important international markets; • changes in government regulation, weather and technology; • availability of financing on terms acceptable to us; and • other risks and uncertainties you can find in our press releases and SEC filings. As a result of these and other factors, no assurance can be given as to our future results and achievements. Accordingly, a forward-looking statement is not a prediction of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report or the date of the document incorporated by reference in this Report. We are under no obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed. We have outstanding long-term debt (exclusive of capital leases) of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion at May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $49 million as of May 31, 2002 and $55 million as of May 31, 2001. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. Currently, derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk. While we are a global provider of transportation services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by foreign currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Foreign currency fluctuations during 2002 did not have a material effect on our results of operations. At May 31, 2002, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $30 million for the year ending May 31, 2003 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately $70 million). This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. We have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges. In 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges, which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices. Therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. For 2001, market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2002 usage and amounted to approximately $100 million, net of hedging settlements. As of May 31, 2001, all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts. See Notes 1 and 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 59 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:49:56.586023

1048911,FDX,FEDEX CORP,2003,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition GENERAL The following management's discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies, of FedEx Corporation (also referred to as ""FedEx""). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements, which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results. FedEx is one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units. These business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments: FedEx Express, the world's largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground, North America's second largest provider of small-package ground delivery service; and FedEx Freight, the largest U.S. provider of regional less-than-truckload (""LTL"") freight services. Our diversified portfolio of services has allowed FedEx to continue to generate revenue and earnings growth during challenging economic times. The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks, as measured by our average daily volume; the mix of services purchased by our customers; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by average price per shipment (yield); our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits, fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels. Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 or ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following table compares revenues, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001(1) 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues $ 22,487 $ 20,607 $ 19,629 +9 +5 Operating income $ 1,471 $ 1,321 $ 1,071 +11 +23 Operating margin 6.5% 6.4% 5.5% Net income $ 830 $ 710 (2) $ 584 +17 +22 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.74 $ 2.34 $ 1.99 +17 +18 (1)Results for 2001 include noncash charges of $102 million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at FedEx Express and a $22 million reorganization charge at FedEx Supply Chain Services. These charges were $78 million after tax or $0.27 per diluted share. See Notes 19 and 21 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (2)Results for 2002 reflect our adoption of SFAS 142, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."" We recognized an adjustment of $25 million ($15 million or $0.05 per share, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of certain goodwill to its implied fair value. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements. 36 Revenue growth during 2003 was attributable to the continued substantial growth of our FedEx Ground business, increased international volumes at FedEx Express and higher revenues at FedEx Freight. Increased U.S. freight volumes at FedEx Express also contributed to consolidated revenue growth, as we benefited from a full twelve months of revenue under the transportation agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (""USPS""), which commenced in late August 2001. During 2002, revenue growth reflected a 21% increase at FedEx Ground and increased U.S. freight volumes from the USPS agreement. In 2002, volume levels in our FedEx Express U.S. domestic and international package services declined as a result of weakness in the U.S. and global economies (particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors) and the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Operating income increased 11% in 2003 as FedEx Ground improved its operating margin to 14.5%, which more than offset a decline in the operating margin at FedEx Express. The sluggish economy, combined with significant increases in pension and healthcare costs and higher maintenance expenses, reduced profitability at FedEx Express in 2003 despite continued cost control efforts. Variable compensation declined in 2003 based on below-plan performance at FedEx Express. During 2002, operating income increased 23%, largely due to the contributions of FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and the fact that 2001 included approximately $124 million in noncash charges (discussed below). Discretionary spending (such as professional fees and travel-related expenses) stayed relatively flat in 2003, as cost control remained a focus. During 2002, discretionary spending was approximately $108 million lower. Pension costs were approximately $80 million higher in 2003 on top of a $90 million increase in 2002, due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets. Although not required, we made additional contributions exceeding $1 billion to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans during 2003 to ensure that our pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our February 28, 2003 plan measurement date. During 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel. Higher net fuel costs negatively affected operating income during 2003, as fuel surcharge revenue increases did not keep pace with rising fuel prices. Although still negative for the year, the net impact of higher fuel prices on 2003 earnings was mitigated during the fourth quarter as fuel prices declined faster than the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. Lower fuel prices during 2002 had a positive impact on operating expenses; however, declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income. We effectively closed jet fuel hedging contracts at the end of 2001 by entering into offsetting contracts. The maturity of these contracts increased 2002 fuel costs by approximately $15 million. During 2001, as a result of lower U.S. domestic volumes at FedEx Express and lower capacity growth forecasts, we committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our MD10 program (which upgrades and modifies our older DC10 aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer MD11 aircraft). By curtailing the MD10 program, we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through 2008. During 2001, we also took actions to reorganize our FedEx Supply Chain Services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable, non-strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead. In addition, due to the bankruptcy of Ayres Corporation, we wrote off deposits and related items in 2001 in connection with the Ayres ALM200 aircraft program. Following is a summary of these pretax charges (in millions): Impairment of certain assets related to the MD10 aircraft program $ 93 Strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary 22 Ayres program write-off 9 Total $ 124 37 Results for 2002 were favorably affected by approximately $12 million, related to the charges above, based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates. No material amounts remained on our balance sheet for these items at the end of 2002. The performance of FedEx Ground and revenue growth from FedEx Freight East (which was acquired in the third quarter of 2001) contributed to improved net income for 2003 and 2002, but was mitigated by continued softness in U.S. domestic package volumes at FedEx Express over the last two fiscal years. Results for 2002 also reflect the cessation of $36 million of goodwill amortization, as required under the new accounting rules for goodwill adopted June 1, 2001, that would have been recorded in operating expenses. Goodwill amortization expense was $26 million for 2001. Other Income and Expense and Income Taxes Net interest expense was 15% lower in 2003 due to reduced borrowings. In 2002, net interest expense was slightly lower, as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year (see ""Financial Condition""). In 2002, other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately $17 million from the early retirement of debt assumed in the FedEx Freight East acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% in 2003, 37.5% in 2002 and 37.0% in 2001. The 38.0% effective tax rate in 2003 was higher due to lower state taxes in 2002. The 37.5% effective tax rate in 2002 was higher than the 2001 effective rate, primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in 2001. The 2002 rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization and by several other factors, none of which were individually significant. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes. For 2004, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. Airline Stabilization Compensation Operations in 2002 were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. During 2002, we recognized a total of $119 million of compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the ""Act""), of which $101 million has been received as of May 31, 2003. The amounts recognized were for our estimate of losses we incurred as a result of the mandatory grounding of our aircraft and for incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001. All amounts recognized were reflected as reduction of operating expense under the caption ""Airline stabilization compensation."" In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Department of Transportation (""DOT"") asserted that we were overpaid by $31.6 million and has demanded repayment. We have filed requests for administrative and judicial review of this determination. We believe that we have complied with all aspects of the Act, that it is probable we will ultimately collect the remaining $18 million receivable and that we will not be required to pay any portion of the DOT's $31.6 million demand. We cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome; however, it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the $119 million of compensation we have previously recognized under the Act could occur. 38 Cost Savings Initiatives On June 2, 2003, FedEx Express announced it will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during 2004 to continue resizing the FedEx Express U.S. organization and improving profitability. The first program will offer voluntary early retirement incentives, with enhanced pension and postretirement healthcare benefits, to certain groups of employees who are age 50 or older. The second program will offer voluntary severance incentives to eligible employees. Both programs are limited to eligible U.S. salaried staff employees and managers at FedEx Express. Depending on employee acceptance rates, the pretax charge for these programs is estimated to be $230 million to $290 million in 2004, with most of the charge to be incurred in the first half of the year. Approximately one-third of the pretax charge will be cash. The remainder of the costs relate primarily to pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities. The cost of these programs will be reflected as a separate component of operating expenses. The estimated savings from these programs are expected to be $100 million to $130 million in 2004, primarily in the second half of the year. Thus, the net cost of these programs in 2004 is expected to be $130 million to $160 million. In 2005 and beyond, the estimated annual savings from these programs are expected to be $150 million to $190 million. The savings from these programs will be reflected primarily in lower ongoing salaries, wages and benefit costs. Over the past few years, we have taken many steps to bring our expense growth in line with revenue growth, particularly at FedEx Express, while maintaining our industry-leading service levels. We have significantly decreased capital expenditures by reducing aircraft orders, consolidating facilities and discontinuing low-value programs. The voluntary early retirement and severance programs are another step in this ongoing process of reducing our cost structure in order to increase our competitiveness, meet the future needs of our employees and provide the expected financial returns for our shareholders. Outlook During 2004, we expect the U.S. economy to remain sluggish at least through our first quarter, with year-over-year economic improvement expected to be evident in our second half results. We believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the U.S. economy are in place, including supportive conditions in the overall financial markets, the recently approved tax stimulus package, continued accommodative monetary policy and improved consumer confidence. Our management teams are focusing on sizing our network for current economic conditions, improving our service offerings, enhancing the customer experience and positioning FedEx to take full advantage of an economic recovery. We continue to believe we are well positioned for long-term growth when the economy, particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, recovers and experiences sustained growth. For 2004, we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of a sustained economic recovery during the second half of 2004 are realized. Our revenue growth strategies will leverage our ""compete collectively"" philosophy. FedEx Ground will continue its six-year expansion plan and FedEx Freight will continue to enhance its portfolio of services. 39 Increasing pension and healthcare expenses, as well as the net costs of our voluntary early retirement and severance programs, will negatively impact operating margins during 2004. We expect our net pension cost for 2004 will increase by approximately $115 million based on a continued decline in interest rates, negative asset returns and a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets from 10.10% to 9.10%. Despite these increases in employee retirement costs, our retirement programs continue to be adequately funded with assets more than sufficient to meet our current obligations. See further discussion in ""Critical Accounting Policies."" During 2003, we announced to our employees that the FedEx Corporation Employees' Pension Plan would be amended to add a cash balance feature, which we call the Portable Pension Account. Eligible employees as of May 31, 2003 may make a one-time election to accrue future pension benefits under either the new cash balance formula or the traditional pension benefit formula. This election is entirely optional. In either case, employees will retain all benefits previously accrued under the traditional pension benefit formula and will continue to receive the benefit of future salary increases on benefits accrued as of May 31, 2003. Eligible employees hired after May 31, 2003 will participate in the Portable Pension Account. While this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our long-term pension costs, it will not have a material effect on 2004 results. We believe our long-term growth strategy will provide improved profits from increases in shipping by high-tech and high-value-added businesses and the globalization of the economy. Our long-term corporate financial objectives are to increase cash flow and financial returns by improving our operating margin, principally at FedEx Express, and through continued growth at our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments. We plan to accomplish this goal by increasing volumes and by matching our cost structure and capital expenditures to expected business levels. At FedEx Express, we expect operating margin improvement will require a return to consistent growth in those sectors of the U.S. economy that most use domestic express air transportation. Margin growth will also depend on increasing volumes of heavier packages at higher yields and a rational pricing environment. Future results will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the U.S. domestic economic recovery, the extent to which eligible employees participate in our voluntary early retirement and severance programs, the impact from any terrorist activities or international conflicts, our ability to match our cost structure and capacity with shifting volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives. In addition, adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual jet and diesel fuel prices paid. Therefore, our operating income could be materially affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or should we be unable to further increase our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel prices due to competitive pressures. Although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming, as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may ultimately have on our results of operations. See ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance. 40 Seasonality of Business Our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday sales. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods. The transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom Critical, while the latter part of December, January, June and July of each year are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of December, January and February of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS A number of new accounting pronouncements were enacted during 2003, mostly in connection with attempts to improve the transparency of financial reporting. None of these new pronouncements had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during 2003. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for discussion of these recent accounting pronouncements. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, each of which operates in a single line of business. Included within ""Other"" are the operations of FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx Services. ""Other"" also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations. Management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income. FedEx Services provides the customer-facing sales, marketing and information technology functions, primarily for our FedEx Express and FedEx Ground reportable segments. The costs for these activities are allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided. These allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions. The line item ""Intercompany charges"" on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx Services to FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and certain other costs such as corporate management fees. In addition, ""Intercompany charges"" also includes allocated charges to our operating companies for management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. We believe the total amounts allocated reasonably reflect the cost of providing such services. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of our reportable segments. 41 FEDEX EXPRESS The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues: Package: U.S. overnight box $ 5,432 $ 5,338 $ 5,830 + 2 - 8 U.S. overnight envelope 1,715 1,755 1,871 - 2 - 6 U.S. deferred 2,510 2,383 2,492 + 5 - 4 Total U.S. domestic package revenue 9,657 9,476 10,193 + 2 - 7 International Priority (IP) 4,367 3,834 3,940 +14 - 3 Total package revenue 14,024 13,310 14,133 + 5 - 6 Freight: U.S. 1,564 1,273 651 +23 +96 International 400 384 424 + 4 - 9 Total freight revenue 1,964 1,657 1,075 +19 +54 Other 363 360 326 + 1 +10 Total revenues 16,351 15,327 15,534 + 7 - 1 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 6,855 6,467 6,301 + 6 + 3 Purchased transportation 608 562 584 + 8 - 4 Rentals and landing fees 1,548 1,524 1,419 + 2 + 7 Depreciation and amortization 801 806 797 - 1 + 1 Fuel 1,231 1,009 1,063 +22 - 5 Maintenance and repairs 1,084 980 968 +11 + 1 Airline stabilization compensation — (119 ) — n/a n/a Intercompany charges 1,347 1,332 1,317 + 1 + 1 Other(1) 2,091 1,955 2,238 + 7 -13 Total operating expenses 15,565 14,516 14,687 + 7 - 1 Operating income $ 786 $ 811 $ 847 - 3 - 4 Operating margin 4.8 % 5.3 % 5.5 % Package statistics: Average daily package volume (ADV): U.S. overnight box 1,176 1,170 1,264 + 1 - 7 U.S. overnight envelope 679 699 757 - 3 - 8 U.S. deferred 897 868 899 + 3 - 3 Total U.S. domestic ADV 2,752 2,737 2,920 + 1 - 6 IP 369 340 346 + 9 - 2 Total ADV 3,121 3,077 3,266 + 1 - 6 Revenue per package (yield): U.S. overnight box $ 18.18 $ 17.90 $ 18.09 + 2 - 1 U.S. overnight envelope 9.95 9.84 9.69 + 1 + 2 U.S. deferred 11.02 10.77 10.87 + 2 - 1 U.S. domestic composite 13.82 13.58 13.69 + 2 - 1 IP 46.59 44.16 44.70 + 6 - 1 Composite package yield 17.69 16.96 16.97 + 4 — Freight statistics: Average daily freight pounds: U.S. 8,969 7,736 4,337 +16 +78 International 2,174 2,082 2,208 + 4 - 6 Total average daily freight pounds 11,143 9,818 6,545 +13 +50 Revenue per pound (yield): U.S. $ .69 $ .65 $ .59 + 6 +10 International .72 .72 .75 — - 4 Composite freight yield .69 .66 .64 + 5 + 3 (1)2001 includes a $93 million charge for impairment of the MD10 aircraft program and a $9 million charge for the Ayres program write-off. 42 FedEx Express Revenues FedEx Express total revenues increased 7% in 2003, largely due to increased IP and U.S. freight revenues. Year-over-year revenue comparisons reflect the impact in 2002 of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which adversely affected both U.S. outbound international shipments and U.S. domestic shipments, and the economic decline that began in calendar 2001. Higher U.S. freight revenues from increased average daily pounds during 2003 also affected year-over-year revenue comparisons, as we benefited from a full twelve months of operations and higher shipping levels under our transportation contract with the USPS. During 2003, total package revenue increased 5%, due to increases in IP volumes and yield. IP volume growth occurred predominantly in Asia and Europe, which experienced average daily volume growth rates of 21% and 11%, respectively, during 2003. In the United States, package revenue increased 2% in 2003 due to higher yield and volumes in the U.S. deferred and U.S. overnight box categories. Total average daily package volumes for 2003 were at levels experienced in 1998. Average daily volumes decreased during 2002 in virtually all package categories, resulting in a 6% decrease in total package revenue. While IP volumes decreased 2% in 2002, principally due to a decline in U.S. outbound shipments, the European and Asian markets positively impacted IP volumes. For 2002, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 15% and 5% in the European and Asian markets, respectively. Yields at FedEx Express increased in 2003 in nearly all service categories and composite average weight per package was flat. The increase in U.S. domestic package yield during 2003 was due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and average list price increases. For U.S. domestic shipments and U.S. outbound international shipments, an average list price increase of 3.5% became effective January 6, 2003. IP yield improvements during 2003 were due to favorable exchange rate differences, increased fuel surcharge revenue and growth in higher-yielding lanes. Package yields in 2002 were slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. Fuel surcharge revenue was higher in 2003 due to higher jet fuel prices and the introduction of a dynamic international fuel surcharge in September 2002. Our fuel surcharge is based on the spot price for jet fuel. During 2002, fuel surcharge revenue was lower compared to 2001 because our dynamic index for determining our U.S. domestic fuel surcharge was not implemented until the second quarter of 2002. Using this index, the U.S. domestic fuel surcharge ranged between 2.0% and 5.5% during 2003 and between 0% and 3% from November 2001 through May 2002. The fuel surcharge during all of 2001 was 4%. International fuel surcharges were as high as 6% during 2003. Total freight revenue for 2003 and 2002 increased significantly due to higher U.S. freight volume and yield, reflecting the impact of the USPS transportation agreement, which began in August 2001 and runs through August 2008. During 2003, FedEx Express entered into a third addendum to the transportation agreement with the USPS, allowing FedEx Express to continue carrying incremental pounds of mail through May 29, 2004 at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement. 43 FedEx Express Operating Income During 2003, the 3% decrease in operating income and the decline in operating margin at FedEx Express was attributable to increased employee benefit costs, higher maintenance expenses and, to a lesser extent, the net impact of higher fuel costs in an economic environment of sluggish U.S. domestic average daily package volumes. The decrease in operating income was also somewhat attributable to one fewer operating day during the year. Operating results during 2003 were impacted by unusually inclement weather during the winter and spring, which decreased business shipping, reduced operational efficiency and increased certain operating costs, such as for snow removal and de-icing. In 2002, operating income at FedEx Express decreased 4% as package volume declines on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions. Excluding $102 million of asset impairment charges taken in 2001, operating income was down 15% in 2002. In 2001, operating income decreases reflected charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter (see ""Consolidated Results""). Salaries, wages and benefits were higher during 2003 and 2002 due to wage rate increases and higher pension and healthcare costs. Also, the increase was partially the result of cost increases related to the USPS contract. Incentive compensation provisions declined in 2003 and 2002 based on below-plan performance. Fuel consumption was higher in 2003 and 2002, primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental U.S. freight pounds transported under the USPS agreement and IP volume growth. During 2003, fuel costs were higher, due to a 16% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel. Higher net fuel costs at FedEx Express negatively affected operating income during 2003 by $24 million, as fuel surcharge revenue increases were not sufficient to offset higher jet fuel prices. Fuel costs were down during 2002, due to a 12% decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel. During 2002, lower fuel surcharge revenue, net of the impact of lower fuel prices, negatively impacted operating income by $32 million. During 2001, higher jet fuel prices negatively affected operating income by approximately $150 million, including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts. Maintenance expenses were higher during 2003, primarily due to the timing of scheduled maintenance events. Depreciation and amortization expense declined during 2003 reflecting a trend of decreasing levels of capital spending, as well as changes in estimated useful lives and salvage values. During 2002, rentals and landing fees were higher primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental U.S. freight volume. Operating income for 2002 also reflects the adoption of new rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets. For FedEx Express, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $12 million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 (this amortization amount was comparable to 2001). During 2003, other operating expenses also increased at FedEx Express. In the prior year, reimbursements from the USPS for network expansion costs were reflected as credits to other operating expenses. These reimbursements, however, had no effect on operating income, as they represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred. Partially offsetting operating costs during 2003 was a gain from the insurance settlement on an aircraft destroyed in an accident in July 2002 that resulted in a net $8 million favorable impact on operating income. During 2002, other operating expenses included $27 million from the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. 44 FedEx Express Outlook We expect revenue to increase at FedEx Express during 2004, in both the domestic and international markets. During 2004, we expect the U.S. economy to remain sluggish at least through our first fiscal quarter, with year-over-year improvement expected to be evident in our second half results. We believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the U.S. economy are in place and, as a result, we expect to see improvements in both yields and volumes. Pension, healthcare and maintenance expenses are expected to continue to increase at a faster rate than revenue growth. On June 2, 2003, we announced that FedEx Express will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during 2004 to continue resizing the FedEx Express U.S. organization and improving profitability. See ""Cost Savings Initiatives"" for further discussion of these programs. While the net cost of these programs is expected to negatively impact operating margin in 2004, we expect margins at FedEx Express will begin to increase in 2005 due to these and other efforts. Our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued aggressive cost management actions and a return to solid growth in our U.S. overnight box volumes related to anticipated improvements in the economy. These cost management actions and improved volumes, along with a sharp focus on productivity, are expected to produce improved operational efficiency as volume growth is absorbed with minimal increases in operating costs. FEDEX GROUND The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues $ 3,413 $ 2,711 $ 2,237 + 26 +21 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 637 532 450 + 20 +18 Purchased transportation 1,294 1,032 881 + 25 +17 Rentals 79 71 67 + 11 + 6 Depreciation and amortization 153 132 111 + 16 +19 Fuel 11 4 8 +175 -50 Maintenance and repairs 86 73 63 + 18 +16 Intercompany charges 329 238 215 + 38 +11 Other 329 292 267 +13 + 9 Total operating expenses 2,918 2,374 2,062 + 23 +15 Operating income $ 495 $ 337 $ 175 + 47 +93 Operating margin 14.5 % 12.4 % 7.8 % Average daily package volume 2,168 1,755 1,520 + 24 +15 Revenue per package (yield) $ 6.25 $ 6.11 $ 5.79 + 2 + 6 45 FedEx Ground Revenues FedEx Ground realized double-digit revenue growth in both 2003 and 2002 due to increased volumes in our business-to-business shipments and continued growth of our home delivery service. During 2003, FedEx Home Delivery added facilities to reach nearly 100% coverage of the U.S. population. Yield at FedEx Ground increased in 2003, due to an average list price increase of 3.9%, which became effective January 6, 2003. Partially offsetting the effect of the price increase were higher levels of discounts and lower average weight per package. In 2002, year-over-year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases, ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages. In the third quarter of 2002, FedEx Ground implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge, based on the spot price for on-highway diesel fuel. This surcharge ranged between 0.75% and 2.00% during 2003 and between 0.50% and 0.75% from February through May 2002. FedEx Ground Operating Income FedEx Ground experienced revenue and earnings growth during 2003 and 2002. Operating margins improved in 2003 in spite of increased intercompany charges for sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs. Operating expenses in most categories increased at a lower rate than the growth in revenues during 2003. In addition, FedEx Ground realized substantial improvements in pick-up and delivery and linehaul productivity. During 2003, salaries and employee benefits increased due to higher pension costs and increases in staffing to support volume growth. Operating results during 2003 were also impacted by inclement weather during the winter and spring, which was more severe than in previous years. The increase in operating income in 2002 was primarily attributable to package volume growth, higher yields, productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in increased depreciation, rental and other property-related expenses during 2002. Salaries, wages and benefits also were higher in 2002 due to additional full-time equivalents and higher pension and healthcare costs. Costs for variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during 2002, reflecting FedEx Ground's outstanding financial performance. The increase in operating income in both 2003 and 2002 was also attributable to improved home delivery service results. In September 2002, FedEx Home Delivery completed the build-out of its national network, enabling it to reach nearly 100% of U.S. residences, with evening, weekend and day- and time-specific delivery options, all backed by a money-back guarantee. Our home delivery service became profitable during 2003. This service had an operating loss of $32 million during 2002 and $52 million during 2001. FedEx Ground's 2001 results also reflect rebranding and reorganization expenses of $15 million, which were expensed as incurred and consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans, trailers and signage. 46 FedEx Ground Outlook We expect revenue at FedEx Ground will continue to grow in 2004, although at a slower rate than in 2003 and 2002. We will continue to pursue revenue growth in all services, led by increased home delivery and overnight ground package volumes. Overall yield improvement will be a primary focus as we continue to expect a very competitive pricing environment. FedEx Ground will also continue to place emphasis on improving on-time delivery, productivity and safety. During 2004, we expect capital spending will grow significantly at FedEx Ground as we continue to focus on network capacity expansion. We also expect higher pension costs, higher facility expenses due to expansion and increases in intercompany allocations for sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs. We expect the 2004 operating margin will be comparable to 2003. FEDEX FREIGHT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margins (dollars in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31: 2003 2002 2001(1) Percent Change 2003/2002 Revenues $ 2,120 $ 1,960 $ 835 + 8 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,255 1,170 489 + 7 Purchased transportation 68 57 23 +19 Rentals 65 64 27 + 2 Depreciation and amortization 83 86 44 - 3 Fuel 89 72 41 +24 Maintenance and repairs 113 90 39 +26 Intercompany charges 13 8 1 +63 Other 256 245 116 + 4 Total operating expenses 1,942 1,792 780 + 8 Operating income $ 178 $ 168 $ 55 + 6 Operating margin 8.4 % 8.6 % 6.6 % Average daily shipments (in thousands)(2) 56 56 56 — Weight per shipment (lbs)(2) 1,114 1,114 1,132 — Yield (Revenue per hundredweight)(2) $ 13.40 $ 12.41 $ 11.83 + 8 (1)Results for 2001 include the financial results of FedEx Freight West from December 1, 2000 and of FedEx Freight East from January 1, 2001 (the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes). Therefore, 2001 results are not comparable to 2002. (2)Statistics for 2001 are based on the portion of the year including both FedEx Freight West and FedEx Freight East (January through May). FedEx Freight Revenues Revenues at FedEx Freight increased during 2003, despite the continued impact of a slow economy, severe winter weather and one fewer operating day during the year. The increase in revenue was attributable to improved yields during 2003. Average daily shipments and weight per shipment were flat, while yield increased 8%. Contributing to the increase in yield during 2003 were the impact of a 5.9% general rate increase in July 2002, favorable contractual renewals, higher fuel surcharge revenue and additional volumes related to EZ Flyer, our premium-priced, interregional freight service. 47 In 2002, revenues were higher due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations for FedEx Freight East. However, revenues were impacted by the economic slowdown and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge during 2002. In 2002, average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year, weight per shipment was down 2% and yield was up 5%. FedEx Freight Operating Income The increase in operating income at FedEx Freight during 2003 was attributable to revenue growth and cost management. Lower depreciation and amortization during 2003 reflects increased gains from the sale of operating assets in the ordinary course of business. Operating margins in 2003 reflect higher maintenance and repairs expenses, which include $14 million of expenses associated with rebranding FedEx Freight East and FedEx Freight West under the name ""FedEx Freight."" The rebranding project began in the fourth quarter of 2002 and is expected to be complete in 2005, with total rebranding costs of approximately $40 million to $45 million. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, consist primarily of incremental external costs for rebranding tractors and trailers. During 2002, operating margins reflect the elimination of goodwill amortization, partially offset by $6 million of rebranding expenses. The increase in operating income during 2002 also reflects the inclusion of a full year of operations as well as the cessation of $15 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses prior to the adoption of new accounting rules (as discussed in ""Consolidated Results""). FedEx Freight Outlook We expect revenue to continue to grow in 2004, largely due to yield improvements and continued growth of higher yielding interregional and international services. In April 2003, we announced that we are offering ocean and ground service from Asia to virtually every continental U.S. ZIP code. This service helps reduce inventory cycle time with fast overall transit times and fewer processes than traditional ocean service from Asia. On June 17, 2003, we announced a general rate increase of 5.9% to be effective June 30, 2003. Volume growth, yield management, enhanced productivity and cost-control measures continue to be major focus areas for FedEx Freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment. OTHER OPERATIONS Other operations include FedEx Custom Critical, a critical-shipment carrier; FedEx Trade Networks, whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company; FedEx Services, a provider of sales, marketing and IT support, primarily for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, and a provider of supply chain management services; and intercompany revenue eliminations, which are not material. Also included in this category are the operating results of FedEx Freight West prior to December 1, 2000. 48 Revenues from other operations were $603 million in 2003 (down 1%) compared to $609 million in 2002 (down 40%) and $1.0 billion in 2001. In 2003, the slight decrease in revenues from our other operations reflects the termination of certain unprofitable supply chain services contracts, partially offset by increased revenues at FedEx Custom Critical. Revenues at FedEx Custom Critical were 12% higher in 2003, due to increased yields, and 24% lower in 2002, largely due to the economic downturn. The demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary (critical shipments) is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators, principally in the automotive industry, where volumes have been depressed since calendar 2001. A significant portion of the decrease in revenues from other operations during 2002 reflects the fact that 2002 results for this category no longer include FedEx Freight West's revenues (see ""FedEx Freight""). Operating income from other operations was $12 million in 2003 compared to $5 million in 2002 and an operating loss of $6 million in 2001. The improvement in operating income in 2003 was primarily attributable to FedEx Trade Networks. In 2002, the improvement over 2001 reflects reduced operating costs at FedEx Supply Chain Services. On March 1, 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc., which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations, at a cost of $36.5 million. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY Cash and cash equivalents totaled $538 million at May 31, 2003, compared to $331 million at May 31, 2002. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,871 $ 2,228 $ 2,044 Cash used in investing activities: Capital investments and other (1,490 ) (1,577 ) (1,636 ) Business acquisitions — (35 ) (477 ) 381 616 (69 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities: Principal payments on debt (10 ) (320 ) (650 ) Proceeds from debt issuances — — 744 Purchases of treasury stock (186 ) (177 ) — Dividends paid (60 ) — — Other financing activities 82 91 28 Net increase in cash $ 207 $ 210 $ 53 The $357 million decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2003 reflected increased funding to our qualified pension plans, partially offset by improved earnings and lower levels of estimated federal income tax payments. Although not required, we made cash contributions to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans of $1.1 billion during 2003 (compared to $150 million in 2002 and $88 million in 2001). (See further discussion concerning our pension plan contributions in ""Critical Accounting Policies."") In 2002, the increase in cash flows from operating activities reflected increases in earnings (which included FedEx Freight for an entire year) and aggressive working capital management. 49 Cash Used for Capital Investments. Capital expenditures were lower in 2003 due to management's cost reduction actions in 2001 and 2002, despite deliveries of aircraft during 2003 that were scheduled and committed to well before the economic slowdown. In 2002, capital expenditures were lower in spite of capital spending related to the 2001 addition of FedEx Freight East. See ""Capital Resources"" for further discussion. Cash Used for Business Acquisitions. During 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc. at a cost of $36.5 million. During 2001, we acquired FedEx Freight East for approximately $980 million with a combination of cash and FedEx common stock. See Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions. Debt Financing Activities. From time to time, we finance certain operating and investing activities through the issuance of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under two revolving credit agreements, totaling $1 billion, and reduces the amount available under these agreements. During the third quarter of 2003, commercial paper borrowings of $200 million were necessary to finance part of the cash contribution to our qualified pension plans. All of the commercial paper borrowings were repaid by April 11, 2003. At May 31, 2003, no commercial paper was outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit agreements was available for future borrowings. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at May 31, 2002. For more information regarding these credit facilities, see Note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2002, certain existing debt at FedEx Express matured, principally $175 million of 9.875% Senior Notes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we prepaid the remaining $101 million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of FedEx Freight East. In the third quarter of 2001, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes. Net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness, principally borrowings under our commercial paper program, and for general corporate purposes. These notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") regulations. During 2002, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing. Under this shelf registration statement we may issue, in one or more offerings, either unsecured debt securities, common stock or a combination of such instruments. The entire $1 billion is available for future financings. Cash Used for Share Repurchases. During 2002 and 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to buy back a total of 15.0 million shares of common stock. During 2003, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $56.66 per share and this decreased cash flows by $186 million. We repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock in 2002, at a cost of approximately $177 million or an average of $52.70 per share. There were no stock repurchases during 2001. A total of 8.0 million shares remain under existing share repurchase authorizations. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared our first-ever cash dividend on May 31, 2002. Total dividends paid in 2003 were $60 million. On June 2, 2003, our Board declared a dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, which we paid on July 1, 2003 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2003. We expect to continue quarterly dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. 50 Other Liquidity Information. We have taken actions (discussed in ""Results of Operations""), including the new Portable Pension Account option for eligible FedEx employees and resizing efforts at FedEx Express, which are expected to reduce our long-term costs and cash outflows. We will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to manage our cash flow in the future. We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems. In recent years, we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Trade Networks. The sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant that we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until 2002. Despite the recent decrease in capital spending, our operations remain capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment, package-handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including preexisting contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities. The following table compares capital expenditures for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Aircraft and related equipment $ 762 $ 730 $ 756 Facilities and sort equipment 254 292 353 Information and technology investments 273 288 406 Vehicles and other equipment 222 305 378 Total capital expenditures $ 1,511 $ 1,615 $ 1,893 (See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment.) Capital expenditures were 6% lower during 2003 and 15% lower in 2002. The majority of this decrease was primarily at FedEx Express, where capital expenditures were 15% and 14% lower in 2003 and 2002, respectively. During both years, we continued to make investments in FedEx Ground's infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand FedEx Freight. We took various actions in 2002 and 2001 in order to reduce future capital expenditures, including those related to the curtailment of our MD10 program (discussed in ""Consolidated Results"") and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase 19 MD11 aircraft. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately $2.1 billion in future capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion in 2004, with much of the year-over-year increase coming from the multi-year capacity expansion of the FedEx Ground network. We expect that internally generated cash, as well as financing available through leasing transactions or borrowings, will be adequate to meet our future capital requirements. 51 Because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft, we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance. Therefore, we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements many years before aircraft are actually needed. We are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible, while continuing to invest strategically in growing business segments. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2003. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 There- after Total (in millions) Amounts reflected in balance sheet: Long-term debt(1) $ 275 $ 6 $ 257 $ 226 $ — $ 831 $ 1,595 Capital lease obligations(2) 44 125 102 11 11 238 531 Other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet: Operating leases 1,368 1,285 1,192 1,155 1,045 8,342 14,387 Unconditional purchase obligations(3) 446 275 227 268 231 1,993 3,440 Total cash obligations $ 2,133 $ 1,691 $ 1,778 $ 1,660 $ 1,287 $ 11,404 $ 19,953 (1)Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (2)Includes related interest. See Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (3)See Note 17 to the accompanying audited financial statements. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table above. Amounts Reflected in Balance Sheet We have other commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required under certain U.S. domestic self-insurance programs and are used in the normal course of international operations. While the notional amounts of these instruments are material, there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FedEx Express amended four leases for MD11 aircraft, which now commits FedEx Express to firm purchase obligations for two of these aircraft during both 2005 and 2006. As a result, the amended leases were accounted for as capital leases, which added $221 million to both long-term assets and long-term liabilities. 52 We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2004 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Balance Sheet The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2003. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of ""off-balance sheet financing""). At the time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after-tax cash flows. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements, as well as in the table above. Credit rating agencies routinely use this information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. Furthermore, our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases. We have guarantees under certain operating leases, amounting to $134 million as of May 31, 2003, for the residual values of aircraft, vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods. Based upon our expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees. See Note 15 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications. Certain of these operating leases were arranged using variable interest entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry. As discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we expect to consolidate one of these entities in the second quarter of 2004 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46. We expect this consolidation to increase our long-term assets and long-term liabilities by approximately $140 million at September 1, 2003. Consolidation will not materially affect our results of operations and our debt covenants will not be adversely affected. In the future, other forms of secured financing and direct purchases may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine that they best suit our needs. We have been successful in obtaining investment capital, both domestic and international, for long-term leases on acceptable terms, although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs. 53 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent auditors. PENSION COST We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees. The accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates, including: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; and employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages. We consider the most critical of these estimates to be our discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long-term rate of return is applied) and the expected rate of future increases in salaries. For FedEx, the determination of a year's pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans. For example, only 5% of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits and the average remaining service life of our employees approximates 14 years (normal retirement is at age 60). Therefore, the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future. This long-time period increases the sensitivity of our annual pension cost to changes in these key estimates. Total pension costs increased approximately $80 million in 2003 and approximately $90 million in 2002 and are expected to increase an additional $115 million in 2004. Pension costs are included in the salaries, wages and benefits caption in our income statements. Following are the components of the pension cost recognized in our income statements (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 374 $ 348 $ 325 Interest cost 438 409 382 Expected return on plan assets (594 ) (621 ) (624 ) Net amortization and deferral 10 13 (23 ) $ 228 $ 149 $ 60 U.S. accounting standards recognize that changes in the many estimates required to account for pensions occur routinely and the accounting rules require the use of techniques to normalize the effects of these changes (typically over the average remaining service lives of our employees). For example, the difference between the estimated return on plan assets and the actual returns for the period are reflected as unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. If the aggregate amount of actuarial gains and losses exceeds a certain corridor level, the excess is amortized over future periods, increasing or decreasing pension costs 54 in those periods. The net amortization and deferral component of pension cost included in the table above reflects the impact of amortizing actuarial gains and losses on pension cost. In 2004, we expect this component of our pension cost to increase due to the impact of lower than expected returns on pension plan assets over the past three years. The anticipated increase in 2004 pension cost is attributable to the following factors (in millions): 2004 Decrease in discount rate $ 20 Reduction in expected return on plan assets 65 Net effect of the amortization of actuarial losses 55 Reduction in rate of salary increases and other (25 ) Net estimated increase in 2004 pension cost $ 115 Accounting standards also require immediate balance sheet recognition of additional pension obligations when the accumulated benefit obligation (""ABO"") exceeds the fair value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement date. During 2003, we made tax-deductible contributions of $1.1 billion to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans in order to fully fund the ABO of these plans. These contributions were not required under the minimum pension funding rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA""). Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans (in millions): 2003 2002 Funded Status of Plans: Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO): Qualified U.S. domestic plans $ 5,725 $ 4,844 Other plans 284 253 Total ABO $ 6,009 $ 5,097 Projected benefit obligation (PBO) $ 7,117 $ 6,227 Fair value of plan assets 5,825 5,510 PBO in excess of plan assets (1,292 ) (717 ) Unrecognized actuarial losses, principally due to investments and changes in discount rate 2,247 823 Unamortized prior service cost and other 116 122 Amounts Included in Balance Sheet $ 1,071 $ 228 Components of Amounts Included in Balance Sheet: Prepaid pension cost $ 1,269 $ 411 Accrued pension liability (198 ) (183 ) Minimum pension liability (42 ) (19 ) Intangible asset and other 42 19 Net amounts recognized in balance sheet $ 1,071 $ 228 Cash Amounts: Cash contributions during the year $ 1,072 $ 161 Benefit payments during the year $ 103 $ 84 55 The funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date. Declining interest rates (which increase the discounted value of the PBO) and recent stock market losses have significantly impacted the funded status of our plans. However, our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for 2003 were less than 2% of plan assets). In order to improve the funded status of our pension plans, we expect to continue to make tax-deductible contributions to the plans in the future. Currently, we do not expect any material contributions for 2004 will be required under ERISA. We have also implemented the new Portable Pension Account (previously discussed in ""Outlook""), which will help reduce the long-term growth of our pension liabilities. The net amounts reflected in our balance sheet related to pension items include a substantial prepaid pension asset. This results from excess cash contributions to the plans over amounts that are recognized as pension expense for financial accounting purposes. Amounts accrued as liabilities (including minimum pension liabilities) relate primarily to unfunded nonqualified plans and international pension plans where additional funding may not provide a current tax deduction. Discount Rate. This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date (the PBO) to their net present value. The discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date (February 28) and affects the succeeding year's pension cost. A decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive for FedEx and a one-basis-point change in the discount rate at February 28, 2003 affects our 2004 pension expense by approximately $1.7 million and our 2003 ABO by approximately $10 million. For example, the 12-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 6.99% for 2004 from 7.11% for 2003 will negatively affect our 2004 pension cost by approximately $20 million. Our 2003 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $60 million by the 63-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 7.11% for 2003 from 7.74% for 2002. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments. This methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity. However, the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds. Plan Assets. Pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities. Our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is intended to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. At February 28, 2003, with nearly $6 billion of plan assets, a one-basis-point change in this assumption affects pension cost by approximately $645,000 (a decrease in the assumed expected long-term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense). 56 Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption: •The duration of our pension plan liabilities, which determines the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets. •The types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next 10- to 15-year time period (or such other time period that may be appropriate). •The investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. Also, we periodically commission detailed asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The study performed for 2003 supported the reasonableness of our 10.10% return assumption based on our liability duration and market conditions at the time we set this assumption. Because of the introduction of the Portable Pension Account for 2004 (which will reduce our liability duration over time), as well as the significant additional contributions we made into the plans in late 2003 and the continuing deterioration of the equity markets through February 28, 2003, we performed a more recent asset/liability study for 2004. The results of this study support our current asset allocation strategy, which is summarized below: Asset Class Target % of Plan Assets Domestic equities 53 % International equities 17 Private equities 5 Total equities 75 Long duration fixed income securities 15 Other fixed income securities 10 100 % The actual allocation of our assets at February 28, 2003 was weighted more toward fixed income securities due to the depressed value of our equity investments and uninvested cash contributions of $815 million made on February 28, 2003. The asset/liability study for 2004 supports a long-term return on assets of at least 9.10%. Our actual compound return on assets was 9.10% for the 15-year period ended March 31, 2003. Based on these factors, we selected 9.10% as our estimated future rate of return on pension assets for 2004. The 100-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return for 2004 will negatively affect our 2004 pension cost by approximately $65 million. Our 2003 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $48 million by the 80-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return to 10.10% for 2003 from 10.90% for 2002. 57 Investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long-term rate of return is applied, which will further increase our pension cost in 2004. Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses subject to amortization were approximately $1.5 billion through February 28, 2003. These unrecognized losses primarily reflect the decline in the stock market over the past three years and may be recovered in future periods. However, to the extent that market performance does not improve, these unrecognized losses are recognized in future periods in the net amortization and deferral component of pension expense. Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value method, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases). The other acceptable method of valuing plan assets is to use the market value of the assets at the measurement date. The application of the calculated-value accounting method reduced 2003 pension cost by approximately $35 million and 2002 pension cost by approximately $16 million compared to the market value method. Salary Increases. The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost. We correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages). Currently, a one-basis-point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately $943,000 (a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost). The decrease in this assumption to 3.15% for 2004 from 3.25% will favorably impact 2004 pension cost by approximately $10 million. For 2003, the decrease in this assumption to 3.25% from 4.00% in 2002 favorably impacted pension cost by approximately $50 million. SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare programs. At May 31, 2003 there were approximately $937 million of self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet ($839 million at May 31, 2002). The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. 58 LONG-LIVED ASSETS Property and Equipment. Our key businesses are capital intensive. More than 60% of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than $10 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control. At various times during 2003, as studies were completed, we made changes to the useful lives and residual values of certain aircraft fleet types, as well as tractors, trailers and other equipment. These changes resulted in a decrease in 2003 depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Had all of these changes been made as of June 1, 2002, depreciation expense for 2003 would have decreased by an additional $12 million. Because we must plan years in advance for future volume levels and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections, we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. For example, in 2001 we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at FedEx Express related to our MD10 conversion program. The decision allowed us to avoid approximately $1.1 billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of $93 million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal. During 2002 we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired MD10 program assets, which resulted in a favorable adjustment of $9 million. See Notes 19 and 21 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more information concerning impairment charges. There were no material asset impairment charges recognized in 2003. 59 Leases. We utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft. Over the years, we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in ""Contractual Cash Obligations"" and Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements, at May 31, 2003 we had approximately $14 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FedEx Express amended four leases for MD11 aircraft. As a result, the amended leases are now accounted for as capital leases, which added $221 million to both long-term assets and long-term liabilities at May 31, 2003. Goodwill. We have in excess of $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses. New accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization. As previously indicated, the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of $25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses. The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values. Changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates. However, once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. We performed our annual impairment tests in 2003 with no indicated impairment to any of our goodwill balances. REVENUE RECOGNITION We believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace. Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments. Our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational, billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and collect amounts due to us. We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or, for our logistics and trade services businesses, upon the completion of services. Transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period: (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. We use the second method; we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred. There are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above: (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts. 60 Unbilled Revenue. Primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers, there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice. At the end of a month, unprocessed invoices may be as much as one-third of the total month's revenue. This revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes. Invoices that are essentially complete represent most of these accruals, with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued. The remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced. Because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes, the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced. Shipments in Process. The majority of our shipments have short cycle times; therefore, less than 5% of a total month's revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period. We periodically perform studies to measure the percentage of completion for shipments in process. At month-end, we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our average price for the respective services. We believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period. Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts Receivable. Like many companies, we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable. Historically, our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective. We also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing corrections. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts, adjustments processed and current collections trends. Total allowances for these future adjustments were $149 million at May 31, 2003 and $147 million at May 31, 2002. We consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we have outstanding long-term debt (exclusive of capital leases) of $1.6 billion at May 31, 2003 and 2002. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $39 million as of May 31, 2003 and $49 million as of May 31, 2002. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. Currently, derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk. While we are a global provider of transportation services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Foreign currency fluctuations during 2003 did not have a material effect on our results of operations. At May 31, 2003, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $36 million for 2004 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately $30 million). This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. We have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges. In 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating U.S. domestic fuel surcharges, which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel. In 2003, we implemented this methodology for determining a fuel surcharge on international shipments as well. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel surcharges. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in our fuel surcharges. For 2001, market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2002 usage and amounted to approximately $100 million, net of hedging settlements. As of May 31, 2001, all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts. See Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 63",2023-12-30 20:49:37.946107
1048911,FDX,FEDEX CORP,2004,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition GENERAL The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (""MD&A"") describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations, as well as the critical accounting policies and estimates, of FedEx Corporation (also referred to as ""FedEx""). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (""Annual Report""), including ""Item 1: Business""; ""Item 6: Selected Financial Data""; ""Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data""; and ""Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,"" which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results. Our MD&A is comprised of three major sections: Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Results of Operations begins with an overview of consolidated 2004 results compared to 2003, and of 2003 results compared to 2002. This section includes a discussion of key actions, such as our business realignment initiatives and the acquisition of FedEx Kinko's, as well as a discussion of our outlook for 2005. The overview is followed by a financial summary and narrative (including a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2005) for each of our four reportable operating segments. We then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the Financial Condition section. We conclude with a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the judgments and assumptions incorporated in our reported financial results. FedEx provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services with companies that operate independently and compete collectively under the respected FedEx brand. These operating companies are primarily represented by FedEx Express, the world's largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground, North America's second largest provider of small-package ground delivery service; FedEx Freight, a leading U.S. provider of regional LTL freight services; and FedEx Kinko's, a leading provider of document solutions and business services. These companies form the core of our reportable segments. In 2004, we changed the reporting and responsibility relationships of our smaller business units so that they now report directly to a core segment. See ""Reportable Segments"" for further discussion and refer to ""Item 1: Business"" for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies. The key factors that affect our operating results are as follows: •the overall customer demand for our various services; •the volumes of transportation and business services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight; •the mix of services purchased by our customers; •the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by average price per shipment (yield); •our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries and benefits, fuel and maintenance; and •our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels. Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2004 or ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. 32 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following table compares revenues, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31: $ Change Percent Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 Revenues $ 24,710 $ 22,487 $ 20,607 2,223 1,880 10 9 Operating income 1,440 (1) 1,471 1,321 (31 ) 150 (2 ) 11 Operating margin 5.8 % 6.5 % 6.4 % n/a n/a (70)bp 10bp Net income $ 838 (1)(2) $ 830 $ 710 (3) 8 120 1 17 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.76 (1)(2) $ 2.74 $ 2.34 (3) 0.02 0.40 1 17 (1)Includes $435 million ($270 million, net of tax, or $0.89 per diluted share) of business realignment costs described below. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (2)Includes a $37 million, net of tax, or $0.12 per diluted share benefit related to a favorable ruling on a tax case and the reduction of our effective tax rate described below. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (3)Results for 2002 reflect our adoption of SFAS 142, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."" We recognized an adjustment of $25 million ($15 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) to reduce the carrying value of certain goodwill to its implied fair value. See Note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements. The following table shows changes in revenues and operating income by reportable segment for 2004 compared to 2003, and 2003 compared to 2002 (in millions): $ Change Revenues Percent Change Revenues $ Change Operating Income Percent Change Operating Income 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 FedEx Express segment 1,030 1,029 6 7 (154 )(1) (18 ) (20 ) (2 ) FedEx Ground segment 329 663 9 23 28 157 6 47 FedEx Freight segment 246 190 10 8 51 8 26 4 FedEx Kinko's segment 521 n/a n/a n/a 39 n/a n/a n/a Other and Eliminations(2) 97 (2 ) n/a n/a 5 3 n/a n/a 2,223 1,880 10 9 (31 ) 150 (2 ) 11 (1)Includes $428 million of business realignment costs described below. (2)Includes the results of operations of FedEx Kinko's from February 12, 2004 (date of acquisition) through February 29, 2004 (approximately $100 million of revenue and $6 million of operating income). Revenue growth during 2004 was attributable to increased volumes of FedEx Express International Priority (IP), FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments, as well as strong growth of IP yields at FedEx Express. Yield improvements at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight also contributed to revenue growth. In addition, FedEx Kinko's (acquired on February 12, 2004) added $621 million of revenue during 2004. 33 During 2003, revenue growth was due to the substantial growth of our FedEx Ground business, increased international volumes at FedEx Express and higher revenues at FedEx Freight. Increased U.S. freight volumes at FedEx Express also contributed to consolidated revenue growth in 2003, as we benefited from a full twelve months of revenue under the transportation agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (""USPS""), which commenced in late August 2001. Operating income decreased 2% in 2004 as costs related to our business realignment initiatives totaled $435 million (partially offset by approximately $150 million of savings). See ""Business Realignment Costs"" for a discussion of these costs and related savings. In total, operating expenses, other than business realignment costs, increased less than the increase in revenue during 2004, despite significant increases in incentive compensation, pension and maintenance costs. During 2003, operating income increased 11% as FedEx Ground significantly improved its operating margin, which more than offset a decline in the operating margin at FedEx Express. The sluggish economy, combined with significant increases in pension and healthcare costs and higher maintenance expenses, reduced profitability at FedEx Express in 2003 despite continued cost control efforts. Salaries and benefits expense increased 10% during 2004 due to higher incentive compensation and pension costs, wage rate increases and the acquisition of FedEx Kinko's. Incentive compensation increased approximately $240 million during 2004 due to above-plan operating income, primarily at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. Incentive compensation declined in 2003 based on below-plan performance at FedEx Express. Pension costs were approximately $115 million higher in 2004 (on top of an $80 million increase in 2003), due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets. Although not legally required, we made $320 million in contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans in 2004 compared to total contributions exceeding $1 billion in 2003. Our 2003 contributions were made to ensure our qualified U.S. pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our February 28, 2003 plan measurement date. Other Income and Expense and Income Taxes Net interest expense decreased slightly in 2004 as the effects of the tax case described below offset increases to interest expense. These increases were due to the amendment of aircraft operating leases and the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. (""FIN"") 46, ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,"" which together resulted in eight MD11 aircraft being recorded as fixed assets and the related obligations being recorded as long-term debt. Interest expense also increased due to additional borrowings related to the FedEx Kinko's acquisition. Net interest expense was 15% lower in 2003 due to reduced borrowings. In August 2003, we received a favorable ruling from the U.S. District Court in Memphis over the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs. The Court held that these costs were ordinary and necessary business expenses and properly deductible. As a result of this decision, we recognized a one-time benefit in 2004 of $26 million, net of tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, primarily related to the reduction of accruals related to this matter and the recognition of interest earned on amounts previously paid to the IRS. Future periods are not expected to be materially affected by the resolution of this matter. Although the IRS has appealed this ruling, we believe the District Court's ruling will be upheld (also, see Note 11 to the accompanying audited financial statements). 34 Our effective tax rate was 36.5% in 2004, 38.0% in 2003 and 37.5% in 2002. The lower effective rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the favorable decision in the tax case discussed above, stronger than anticipated international results and the results of tax audits during 2004. Our stronger than anticipated international results, along with other factors, increased our ability to credit income taxes paid to foreign governments on foreign income against U.S. income taxes paid on the same income, thereby mitigating our exposure to double taxation. The 38.0% effective tax rate in 2003 was higher than the 2002 rate primarily due to lower state taxes in 2002. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes. For 2005, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. Business Realignment Costs During 2004, voluntary early retirement incentives with enhanced pension and postretirement healthcare benefits were offered to certain groups of employees at FedEx Express who were age 50 or older. Voluntary cash severance incentives were also offered to eligible employees at FedEx Express. These programs, which commenced August 1, 2003 and expired during the second quarter, were limited to eligible U.S. salaried staff employees and managers. Approximately 3,600 employees accepted offers under these programs. The response to these voluntary programs substantially exceeded our expectations. Consequently, replacement management and staff were required and some employee departure dates were deferred (up to May 31, 2004). Costs were also incurred in 2004 for the elimination of certain management positions at FedEx Express and other business units based on the staff reductions from the voluntary programs and other cost reduction initiatives. Costs for the benefits provided under the voluntary programs were recognized in the period that eligible employees accepted the offer. Other costs associated with business realignment activities were recognized in the period incurred. We recognized $435 million of business realignment costs during 2004. Savings of approximately $150 million were realized, reflected primarily in lower salaries and benefits costs. The components of our business realignment costs and changes in the related accruals were as follows for the year ended May 31, 2004 (in millions): Voluntary Retirement Voluntary Severance Other(1) Total Beginning accrual balances $ — $ — $ — $ — Charged to expense 202 158 75 435 Cash paid (8 ) (152 ) (31 ) (191 ) Amounts charged to other assets/liabilities (194 ) — (22 ) (216 ) Ending accrual balances $ — $ 6 $ 22 $ 28 (1)Other includes costs for management severance agreements, which are payable over future periods, including compensation related to the modification of previously granted stock options and incremental pension and healthcare benefits. Other also includes professional fees directly associated with the business realignment initiatives and relocation costs. Total cash payments under these programs are expected to be approximately $220 million. Amounts charged to other assets/liabilities relate primarily to incremental pension and healthcare benefits. Over the past few years, we have taken many steps toward bringing our expense growth in line with revenue growth, particularly at FedEx Express, while maintaining our industry-leading service levels. We have significantly decreased capital expenditures by reducing aircraft orders, consolidating facilities and discontinuing low-value programs. These business realignment initiatives are another step in this 35 ongoing process of reducing our cost structure in order to increase our competitiveness, meet the future needs of our employees and provide the expected financial returns for our shareholders. FedEx Kinko's Acquisition On February 12, 2004, we acquired FedEx Kinko's for approximately $2.4 billion in cash. We also assumed $39 million of capital lease obligations. FedEx Kinko's is a leading provider of document solutions and business services. Its network of worldwide locations offers access to color printing, finishing and presentation services, Internet access, videoconferencing, outsourcing, managed services, Web-based printing and document management solutions. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of FedEx Kinko's were recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill, as the acquisition of FedEx Kinko's expands our portfolio of business services, while providing a substantially enhanced capability to provide package-shipping services to small- and medium-sized business customers through FedEx Kinko's array of retail store locations. The assets and liabilities related to FedEx Kinko's have been included in the accompanying audited balance sheet based on a purchase price allocation. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill, as well as the assignment of goodwill to our reportable segments, was based primarily on internal estimates of cash flows and independent appraisals. We used an independent appraisal firm to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, primarily property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, including the Kinko's trade name, customer-related intangibles, technology assets and contract-based intangibles. While the purchase price allocation is substantially complete and we do not expect any material adjustments, we may make adjustments to the purchase price allocation if new data becomes available. See Notes 2 and 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of the purchase price allocation and goodwill and intangible assets. The results of operations of FedEx Kinko's have been included in our consolidated financial statements from February 12, 2004. During 2004, FedEx Kinko's contributed $621 million of revenue and $0.06 per diluted share of earnings, which includes approximately $15 million of interest and financing costs and $3 million of rebranding costs. Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements includes the unaudited pro forma results of operations of FedEx as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of 2003. The accounting literature establishes firm guidelines around how this pro forma information is presented, which precludes the assumption of business synergies. Therefore, this unaudited pro forma information is not intended to represent, nor do we believe it is indicative of the consolidated results of operations of FedEx that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of 2003. Furthermore, this pro forma information is not representative of the future consolidated results of operations of FedEx. We paid a portion of the purchase price from available cash balances. To finance the remainder of the purchase price, we entered into a six-month credit facility for $2 billion. During February 2004, we issued commercial paper backed by unused commitments under this facility. In March 2004, we replaced the commercial paper with the issuance of $1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches: one, three and five years at $600 million, $500 million and $500 million, respectively. We canceled the six-month credit facility in March 2004. See Notes 2 and 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion. 36 Airline Stabilization Compensation Operations in 2002 were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. During 2002, we recognized a total of $119 million of compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the ""Act""), of which $101 million had been received as of May 31, 2004. The amounts recognized were for our estimate of losses we incurred as a result of the mandatory grounding of our aircraft and for incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001. All amounts recognized were reflected as reduction of operating expense under the caption ""Airline stabilization compensation."" In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Department of Transportation (""DOT"") asserted that we were overpaid by $31.6 million and has demanded repayment. We have filed requests for administrative and judicial review. We received an opinion from the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals stating that most of the determinations that we requested were not yet ripe for decision and the Court will not rule prior to final determination by the DOT and exhaustion of administrative remedies. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization enacted during the third quarter of 2004, the General Accounting Office submitted a report to Congress on June 4, 2004, on the criteria and procedures used by the Secretary of Transportation under the Act. Issuance of the report frees the DOT to make a final determination on our claim and also reinforces the Congressional directive to the DOT to refer any remaining disputed claims to an administrative law judge upon an affected claimant's request. We agreed to mediation with the DOT, but it did not result in a resolution of the dispute. We will continue to pursue our claim for compensation under the Act. We believe that we have complied with all aspects of the Act, that it is probable we will ultimately collect the remaining $18 million receivable and that we will not be required to pay any portion of the DOT's $31.6 million demand. We cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome; however, it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the $119 million of compensation we have previously recognized under the Act could occur. Based on the DOT's assertion, the range for potential loss on this matter is zero to $49.6 million. Outlook During 2005 (particularly during the first half), we expect the U.S. economy to sustain the growth evident in the second half of 2004. This growth is supported by strong corporate earnings, higher consumer confidence (led by both increasing income and an improving job market) and public sector improvement. The macro economic environment during 2004 was particularly challenging for our business, as the manufacturing and wholesale sectors of the economy lagged behind gross domestic product, and year-over-year performance in the economy lagged sequential quarter-to-quarter growth. We expect the current economic expansion to broaden into the manufacturing and wholesale sectors during 2005 as supported by the recent strengthening of durable goods sales, indicating the inventory restocking cycle has started. This is further supported by the positive year-over-year volume trends across all our transportation companies in the fourth quarter of 2004. We also expect a strong global economy in 2005, evidenced by recent broad-based growth across multiple sectors and regions, particularly in Asia. Our outlook anticipates revenue and earnings growth in all our reportable segments for 2005, as we continue to leverage our ""compete collectively"" philosophy. Our optimism stems from increasing customer demand for services across our operating companies, a lower cost structure at FedEx Express, as well as improving worldwide economic conditions. During 2005, we expect continued strong growth 37 of international volumes and yields at FedEx Express. We expect only slight U.S. domestic volume growth at FedEx Express, with higher U.S. domestic yields to account for a large portion of revenue growth at FedEx Express. We anticipate improved volumes and yields at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, as FedEx Ground continues its multi-year capacity expansion plan and FedEx Freight continues to grow its regional and interregional business and enhance its portfolio of services. FedEx Kinko's revenue is projected to be approximately $2.1 billion, which is significantly higher than the partial year revenue included in our 2004 results. FedEx Kinko's will focus on continuing to generate revenue growth by aggressively growing current lines of business and by leveraging its new relationship with FedEx. We anticipate significant year-over-year growth of both operating income and margins. These measures will be positively impacted by revenue growth and the full-year savings from our business realignment initiatives (which are expected to be approximately $80 million to $90 million higher than 2004 savings) discussed above. Over the past several years we have experienced significant year-over-year increases in pension cost. For 2005, we expect a modest $30 million increase in pension cost, as 2004 actual asset returns have substantially improved the funded status of our pension plans in spite of a continued decline in the discount rate. Also, incentive compensation programs were reinstated to more normalized levels in 2004, after several years of declines. Our management teams continue to examine additional cost reduction and operational productivity opportunities as we focus on optimizing our networks, improving our service offerings, enhancing the customer experience and positioning FedEx to increase cash flow and financial returns by improving our operating margin. During 2005, we expect to incur approximately $20 million of expenses related to the FedEx Kinko's rebranding. In addition, we plan to open approximately 70 new FedEx Kinko's locations, including many internationally. Despite these costs, we expect FedEx Kinko's to contribute to earnings growth in 2005 as we move quickly to expand our service offerings at its U.S. locations. See ""FedEx Kinko's Acquisition"" and ""Reportable Segments"" for additional discussion. The pilots of FedEx Express, which represent a small number of FedEx Express total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations with the pilots' union began in March 2004, as the current agreement became amendable on May 31, 2004. We will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots. Our financial results for 2005 may be affected by the results of these negotiations. However, we cannot estimate the financial impact, if any, the results of these negotiations may have on our results of operations. Increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and have not had a material impact on our operating results for the periods presented. Although no specific proposals have been issued, further measures may be forthcoming. The impact on our results of operations of any such additional measures is unknown. Future results will depend upon a number of factors, including U.S. and international economic conditions, the impact from any terrorist activities or international conflicts, our ability to match our cost structure and capacity with shifting volume levels, our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives and our ability to effectively operate, integrate and leverage the FedEx Kinko's business. In addition, adjustments to our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express lag changes in actual jet fuel prices paid. Therefore, our operating income could be materially affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or should we be unable to further increase our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel prices due to competitive pressures. See ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance. 38 Seasonality of Business Our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday sales. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods. The transportation and business services industries are affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December, January, June and July of each year are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall of each year are the busiest periods and the latter part of December, January and February of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our transportation companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No new accounting pronouncements had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows during 2004. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Kinko's form the core of our reportable segments. In 2004, we changed the reporting and responsibility relationships of our smaller business units so they now report directly to a core segment. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new segment presentation. (For further discussion of our operating companies, refer to ""Item 1: Business."") Our reportable segments include the following businesses: FedEx Express Segment FedEx Express (express transportation) FedEx Trade Networks (global trade services) FedEx Ground Segment FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery) FedEx Supply Chain Services (contract logistics) FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight (regional LTL freight) FedEx Custom Critical (surface-expedited transportation) Caribbean Transportation Services (airfreight forwarding) FedEx Kinko's Segment FedEx Kinko's (document solutions and business services) FedEx Services provides customer-facing sales, marketing and information technology support, primarily for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. The costs for these activities are allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided. These allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions. The line item ""Intercompany charges"" on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx Services to FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, allocations for services provided between operating companies, and certain other costs such as corporate management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions.

IP revenues increased significantly on volume growth (7%) and higher yield (9%). Asia experienced strong average daily volume growth (led by China with volume growth of over 50%), while outbound shipments from Europe, the United States and Latin America continued to improve. The increase in IP yield was largely attributable to Europe. The yield increase was primarily due to higher average weight per package, favorable exchange rate differences and higher fuel surcharge revenue. U.S. domestic package revenue increased 2% in 2004 as both volumes and yields grew slightly. For U.S. domestic composite yield, a small decline in average rate per pound was offset by increases in average weight per package and fuel surcharge revenue. For U.S. domestic shipments and U.S. outbound international shipments, an average list price increase of 2.5%, along with certain surcharge increases, became effective January 5, 2004. Freight revenue increased in 2004 due to increased yields related to service mix, despite lower volumes. FedEx Express segment total revenues increased 7% in 2003, largely due to increased IP and U.S. freight revenues. Year-over-year revenue comparisons reflect the impact in 2002 of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which adversely affected both U.S. outbound international shipments and U.S. domestic shipments, and the economic decline that began in calendar 2001. IP volume growth occurred predominantly in Asia and Europe, which experienced average daily volume growth rates of 21% and 11%, respectively, during 2003. IP yield improvements during 2003 were due to favorable exchange rate differences, increased fuel surcharge revenue and growth in higher-yielding lanes. U.S. domestic package revenue increased 2% in 2003 due to higher yield and volumes in the U.S. deferred and overnight box categories. The increase in U.S. domestic package yield during 2003 was due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and average list price increases. Higher U.S. freight revenues from increased average daily pounds during 2003 also affected year-over-year revenue comparisons, as we benefited from a full twelve months of operations and higher shipping levels under our transportation contract with the USPS, which began in August 2001. Fuel surcharge revenue was higher in 2004 and 2003 primarily due to higher jet fuel prices and the introduction of certain international dynamic fuel surcharges in September 2002. Our dynamic fuel surcharges are based on the spot price for jet fuel. During 2003, fuel surcharge revenue was also higher because our dynamic index for determining our U.S. domestic fuel surcharge was not implemented until the second quarter of 2002. Using this index, the U.S. domestic fuel surcharge ranged between 3.0% and 6.5% during 2004, 2.0% and 5.5% during 2003 and between 0% and 3% from November 2001 through May 2002. International fuel surcharges ranged between 2% and 6.5% during 2004 and were as high as 6% during 2003. FedEx Express Segment Operating Income During 2004, operating income decreased 20% due to business realignment costs totaling $428 million (partially offset by approximately $150 million of savings). Higher incentive compensation and pension costs and base salary increases, as well as higher maintenance expenses, were offset by revenue growth and ongoing cost control efforts. In addition, 2004 benefited from one additional operating day. During 2003, the 2% decrease in operating income and the decline in operating margin at FedEx Express were attributable to increased employee benefits costs, higher maintenance expenses and, to a lesser extent, the net impact of higher fuel costs in an economic environment of sluggish U.S. domestic average daily package volumes. Contributing to the decrease in operating income was one fewer operating day. 41 Operating results during 2003 were also impacted by unusually inclement weather during the winter and spring, which decreased business shipping, reduced operational efficiency and increased certain operating costs, such as for snow removal and de-icing. Salaries and benefits were higher during 2004 due to higher incentive compensation and pension costs and wage rate increases. This increase was partially offset by savings from the business realignment initiatives. The 2003 increase was due to wage rate increases and higher pension and healthcare costs. In addition, higher salaries and benefits were partially the result of cost increases related to the USPS contract. Incentive compensation provisions declined in 2003 based on below-plan performance. Purchased transportation costs increased in 2004 and 2003 as IP volume growth led to an increase in contract pick-up and delivery services. Higher maintenance costs in both 2004 and 2003 were primarily due to the timing of scheduled aircraft maintenance events, higher utilization of aircraft related to USPS volumes and a higher average age of certain types of our aircraft. Intercompany charges increased during 2004 due to higher incentive compensation, healthcare and pension costs and base salary increases at FedEx Services. Fuel costs were higher in 2004 due to a 10% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel, as fuel consumption was flat. However, fuel surcharge revenue more than offset higher jet fuel prices primarily due to the introduction of certain international dynamic fuel surcharges in September 2002. Fuel consumption was higher in 2003, primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental U.S. freight pounds transported under the USPS agreement and IP volume growth. Fuel costs were also higher in 2003 due to a 16% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel. Higher net fuel costs at FedEx Express negatively affected operating income during 2003, as fuel surcharge revenue increases were not sufficient to offset higher jet fuel prices. Rentals and landing fees decreased in 2004 due to the amendment of operating leases for six MD11 aircraft that resulted in these aircraft being recorded as fixed assets under capital lease. In addition, as discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited financial statements, two additional MD11s were recorded as fixed assets at September 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of FIN 46. Depreciation and amortization expense declined slightly due to decreases in capital spending, despite the additional depreciation from the eight MD11 aircraft added to fixed assets. During 2003, other operating expenses increased at FedEx Express as reimbursements in 2002 from the USPS for network expansion costs were reflected as credits in other operating expenses. These reimbursements, however, had no effect on operating income, as they represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred. Partially offsetting operating costs during 2003 was a gain from the insurance settlement on an aircraft destroyed in an accident in July 2002 that resulted in a net $8 million favorable impact on operating income. During 2002, other operating expenses included $27 million from the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. 42 FedEx Express Segment Outlook We anticipate revenue growth at FedEx Express during 2005, in both the domestic and international markets. Revenue increases will be led by IP, where we expect volume and yield growth, particularly in Asia, U.S. outbound and Europe. We expect only slight U.S. domestic volume growth at FedEx Express, with higher U.S. domestic yields to account for a large portion of revenue growth at FedEx Express. We expect significant operating margin improvement at FedEx Express during 2005, led by the full-year salaries and benefits savings of our 2004 business realignment initiatives. These cost management actions and improved volumes, along with a sharp focus on productivity, are expected to produce improved operational efficiency. In addition, we expect additional improvement due to IP volume growth with solid incremental margins, increased U.S. domestic yields and volumes aided by the FedEx Kinko's retail presence and the impact of reduced capital spending in prior years. While capital expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to be higher than 2004 due to planned aircraft purchases to support IP volume growth, they are expected to remain below historical levels. FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 Revenues $ 3,910 $ 3,581 $ 2,918 9 23 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 740 709 623 4 14 Purchased transportation 1,465 1,327 1,067 10 24 Rentals 98 88 85 11 4 Depreciation and amortization 154 155 136 (1 ) 14 Fuel 16 11 5 45 120 Maintenance and repairs 95 89 76 7 17 Business realignment costs 1 — — n/a n/a Intercompany charges 432 346 256 25 35 Other 387 362 333 7 9 Total operating expenses 3,388 3,087 2,581 10 20 Operating income $ 522 $ 494 $ 337 6 47 Operating margin 13.4 % 13.8 % 11.5 % Average daily package volume(1) 2,285 2,168 1,755 5 24 Revenue per package (yield)(1) $ 6.48 $ 6.25 $ 6.11 4 2 (1)Package statistics include only the operations of FedEx Ground. 43 FedEx Ground Segment Revenues Revenues increased during 2004 due to higher volumes and yield improvement, led by increased usage of our home delivery service. Average daily volume continued its sequential growth in the fourth quarter, with a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2003, up from 1%, 3% and 6% growth in the first, second and third quarters, respectively. The lower average daily volume increase for 2004 was due to a difficult year-over-year comparison, as first quarter 2003 volume included an estimated 140,000 to 150,000 daily packages as a result of the threat of a UPS work stoppage. In addition, 2004 benefited from two additional operating days. The FedEx Ground segment realized 23% revenue growth in 2003, despite one less operating day, due to increased volumes in our business-to-business shipments and continued growth of our home delivery service. During 2003, our home delivery service added facilities to reach nearly 100% coverage of the U.S. population. Yield at FedEx Ground increased in 2004 primarily due to general rate increases and an increase in extra services revenue, partially offset by higher customer discounts and the elimination of the fuel surcharge in January. An average list price increase of 1.9% on FedEx Ground services became effective January 5, 2004. On that date, the fuel surcharge for all FedEx Ground shipments was discontinued. In 2003, year-over-year yield increases were due to an average list price increase of 3.9%, which became effective January 6, 2003. Partially offsetting the effect of the price increase were higher levels of discounts and lower average weight per package. In the third quarter of 2002, FedEx Ground implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge, based on the spot price for on-highway diesel fuel. Before its elimination in January 2004, this surcharge ranged between 1.25% and 1.50% during 2004, between 0.75% and 2.00% during 2003 and between 0.50% and 0.75% from February through May 2002. FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income Operating income increased in 2004 due to volume growth, yield improvements and increased productivity. These gains were partially offset by higher intercompany charges, increased healthcare and pension costs and expenses related to terminal expansions and relocations. FedEx Ground utilized a larger portion of allocated sales, marketing, information technology and customer support resources. The cost of providing these services increased due to higher incentive compensation, healthcare and pension costs and base salary increases at FedEx Services. Operating margin for the segment was also negatively affected by operating losses at FedEx Supply Chain Services. Operating margins improved in 2003 as FedEx Ground realized substantial improvements in pick-up and delivery and linehaul productivity. Similar to 2004, intercompany charges increased due to the utilization of a larger portion of allocated resources from FedEx Services. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2003 due to higher pension costs and increases in staffing to support volume growth. Operating results during 2003 were also impacted by inclement weather during the winter and spring, which was more severe than in previous years. The increase in operating income in both 2004 and 2003 was also attributable to improved home delivery service results. In September 2002, FedEx Ground completed the build-out of its national home delivery network, enabling it to reach nearly 100% of U.S. residences, with evening, weekend and day- and time-specific delivery options, all backed by a money-back guarantee. Our home delivery service became profitable during 2003. This service had an operating loss of $32 million during 2002. 44 FedEx Ground Segment Outlook We expect FedEx Ground to return to double-digit revenue growth in 2005, led by increased home delivery and next-business day package volume and modest yield improvement. Average daily volume is expected to improve on its 2004 growth of 5%. Anticipated yield improvements from the average list price increase and extra services revenue will be partially offset by the impact from the elimination of FedEx Ground's fuel surcharge in January 2004. FedEx Ground will also continue to place emphasis on improving on-time delivery, productivity and safety. During 2005, we expect continued growth in capital spending at FedEx Ground as we continue to focus on network capacity expansion. As a result of losses at FedEx Supply Chain Services, higher facility expenses due to expansion and slower yield growth primarily due to the elimination of FedEx Ground's fuel surcharge, we expect the 2005 operating margin will be comparable to 2004. FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31: Percent change 2004 2003 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 Revenues $ 2,689 $ 2,443 $ 2,253 10 8 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,427 1,303 1,218 10 7 Purchased transportation 254 224 197 13 14 Rentals and landing fees 100 105 101 (5 ) 4 Depreciation and amortization 92 88 91 5 (3 ) Fuel 122 107 87 14 23 Maintenance and repairs 116 115 91 1 26 Intercompany charges 21 17 13 24 31 Other 313 291 270 8 8 Total operating expenses 2,445 2,250 2,068 9 9 Operating income $ 244 $ 193 $ 185 26 4 Operating margin 9.1 % 7.9 % 8.2 % Average daily LTL shipments (in thousands) 58 56 56 4 — Weight per LTL shipment (lbs) 1,127 1,114 1,114 1 — LTL yield (revenue per hundredweight) $ 14.23 $ 13.40 $ 12.41 6 8 FedEx Freight Segment Revenues The double-digit increase in FedEx Freight segment revenues during 2004 was primarily due to increases in LTL yield and LTL average daily shipments. Year-over-year growth in LTL average daily shipments accelerated to 11% in the fourth quarter of 2004, reflecting a strengthening economy and market-share gains. LTL yield grew 6% during the year, reflecting incremental fuel surcharges due to higher fuel prices, growth in our interregional freight service, a 5.9% general rate increase in June 2003 and favorable contract renewals. In addition, 2004 had one additional operating day. Revenues increased 8% during 2003 due to improved LTL yield, despite the continued impact of a slow economy, severe winter weather and one fewer operating day during the year. 45 FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income The 26% increase in operating income at the FedEx Freight segment during 2004 was primarily attributable to LTL revenue growth and cost management. Operating margins improved as yield management and operational productivity gains outpaced increased incentive compensation, fuel, insurance and claims, pension and healthcare costs. Purchased transportation increased primarily due to the growth of our interregional freight service. During 2003, operating income also increased due to LTL revenue growth and cost management. Lower depreciation and amortization during 2003 reflects increased gains from the sale of operating assets in the ordinary course of business. Operating margin improved more than 100 basis points in 2004 on strong revenue growth. Lower operating margins in 2003 reflect higher maintenance and repairs expenses, which include $8 million of incremental expenses associated with rebranding our two regional LTL carriers under the common name ""FedEx Freight."" The rebranding project began in the fourth quarter of 2002 and is expected to be complete in 2005. Through the end of 2004, rebranding expenses totaled $31 million of the anticipated total project cost of $41 million. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, consist primarily of incremental external costs for rebranding tractors and trailers. FedEx Freight Segment Outlook We expect revenue to continue to grow in 2005, due to both LTL yield improvement and LTL daily shipment growth. Continued market share growth, a general rate increase and a relatively stable industry-pricing environment are expected to contribute to LTL yield improvement. We implemented a general rate increase of 5.9%, effective June 14, 2004. Our no-fee money-back guarantee, implemented in September 2003, continues to be a differentiator in the market, generating additional business with new and existing customers. Continued consolidation among carriers and an improving economy are providing many opportunities for FedEx Freight to promote its profitable interregional service. In addition, through collaboration with other FedEx operating companies, FedEx Freight is increasing business levels with its major customers. Contributing to the positive outlook for 2005 is FedEx Freight's disciplined approach to yield management, coupled with strategic investments in capacity. 46 FEDEX KINKO'S SEGMENT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) for the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2004: Revenues $ 521 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 185 Rentals 115 Depreciation and amortization 33 Maintenance and repairs 9 Other 140 Total operating expenses 482 Operating income $ 39 Operating margin 7.5 % FedEx Kinko's Segment Operating Results The results of operations of FedEx Kinko's are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition (February 12, 2004). The FedEx Kinko's segment was formed in the fourth quarter of 2004. The results of operations from February 12, 2004 (the date of acquisition) through February 29, 2004 were included in ""Other and Eliminations"" (approximately $100 million of revenue and $6 million of operating income). FedEx Kinko's has focused on strengthening its current lines of business, which include black-and-white, color and custom printing, copying and binding services, facilities management and outsourcing, high-speed Internet access and computer usage, signs and graphics, sale of retail products and others. Fourth quarter revenue was primarily driven by strong performance in signs and graphics, finishing services and retail products. As in-home technological advances have impacted the traditional retail walk-up business, FedEx Kinko's has expanded its efforts to attract a larger share of the commercial document solutions and business service market. FedEx Kinko's operating margin benefited from strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter. Additionally, our efforts to optimize production machines within each store location resulted in reduced lease and maintenance costs. Negatively impacting operating margin was approximately $3 million of rebranding costs. The caption ""Other"" in the financial summary above includes supplies and other direct costs, such as paper and toner. FedEx Kinko's Segment Outlook In 2005, FedEx Kinko's will focus on continuing to generate revenue growth by leveraging its new relationship with FedEx. FedEx Kinko's plans to open approximately 70 new locations in 2005, including many internationally. In addition, there are significant opportunities for growth in full-service color copies, finishing services and signs and graphics product offerings. We expect operating margins to decrease in 2005, as FedEx Kinko's will absorb a portion of the FedEx Corporation headquarters' fees commencing in 2005 and approximately $20 million in rebranding costs. On April 26, 2004, we announced the new brand identity for FedEx Kinko's retail locations—FedEx Kinko's Office and Print Centers. Following this announcement, we began accepting packages to be shipped from our U.S. locations. This capability will also allow FedEx Kinko's to launch ""pack-and-ship"" services in 2005. Management is also focusing on cost reduction and control, with 47 continued focus on machine optimization, increased opportunities for strategic sourcing of operating expenses such as supplies and machines and implementing best practices across the FedEx Kinko's network. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million, primarily for technology- and equipment-related projects, real estate and rebranding. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.046 billion at May 31, 2004, compared to $538 million at May 31, 2003. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,020 $ 1,871 $ 2,228 Investing activities: Business acquisition, net of cash acquired (2,410 ) — (35 ) Capital expenditures and other investing activities (1,252 ) (1,490 ) (1,577 ) Net cash used in investing activities (3,662 ) (1,490 ) (1,612 ) Financing activities: Principal payments on debt (319 ) (10 ) (320 ) Proceeds from debt issuances 1,599 — — Repurchase of treasury stock (179 ) (186 ) (177 ) Dividends paid (66 ) (60 ) — Other financing activities 115 82 91 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,150 (174 ) (406 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 508 $ 207 $ 210 The $1.149 billion increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2004 was largely attributable to lower pension contributions. Working capital management more than offset cash paid related to the business realignment initiatives. The $357 million decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2003 reflected increased funding to our qualified pension plans, partially offset by improved earnings and lower levels of estimated federal income tax payments. Although not legally required, we made cash contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans of $1.1 billion during 2003 (compared to $320 million in 2004 and $150 million in 2002). 48 Cash Used for Business Acquisitions. On February 12, 2004, we acquired all of the common stock of FedEx Kinko's for approximately $2.4 billion in cash. See ""Debt Financing Activities"" and ""FedEx Kinko's Acquisition"" for further discussion. During 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc. at a cost of $36.5 million. See Note 2 of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions. Cash Used for Capital Investments. For 2004, capital expenditures declined due to lower aircraft expenditures at FedEx Express, partially offset by an increase from network capacity expansion at FedEx Ground. Capital expenditures were also lower in 2003 due to management's cost reduction actions in 2001 and 2002, despite deliveries of aircraft during 2003 that were scheduled and committed to well before the economic slowdown. See ""Capital Resources"" for further discussion. Debt Financing Activities. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under two credit agreements, totaling $1 billion, and reduces the amount available under these agreements. Commercial paper borrowings of $1.9 billion were necessary to finance part of our $2.4 billion acquisition of FedEx Kinko's. These borrowings were backed by a new six-month $2 billion credit agreement. During February 2004, we issued commercial paper backed by unused commitments under this facility. In March 2004, we issued $1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches: one, three and five years, at $600 million, $500 million and $500 million, respectively. These notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") regulations. Net proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay our commercial paper borrowings backed by the six-month facility. We canceled the six-month credit facility in March 2004. At May 31, 2004, no commercial paper borrowings were outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit agreements was available for future borrowings. Our debt and revolving credit agreements contain certain covenants and restrictions, none of which are expected to affect our operations or ability to pay dividends. During 2004, $250 million of senior unsecured notes matured and were paid. In addition, $25 million of existing unsecured debt at FedEx Express matured and was paid. During the third quarter of 2003, commercial paper borrowings of $200 million were necessary to finance part of the cash contribution to our qualified pension plans. All of the commercial paper borrowings were repaid by April 11, 2003. At May 31, 2003, no commercial paper was outstanding. For more information regarding our credit facilities, see Note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing. Under this shelf registration statement we may issue, in one or more offerings, either unsecured debt securities, common stock or a combination of such instruments. The entire $1 billion is available for future financings. Cash Used for Share Repurchases. During 2004 and 2002, our Board of Directors authorized us to buy back a total of 15.0 million shares of common stock. During the first half of 2004, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average price of $68.14 per share, which decreased cash flows by approximately $179 million. No shares were repurchased during the second half of 2004. We repurchased 3.3 million shares in 2003 at an average price of $56.66 per share and this decreased cash flows by $186 million. During 2002, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock, at a cost of approximately $177 million or an average of $52.70 per share. Based on our current financing strategy, we have significantly reduced the number of shares we expect to repurchase and instead are issuing new shares in connection with our equity compensation programs. A total of 5.75 million shares remain under existing share repurchase authorizations. 49 Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared our first-ever cash dividend on May 31, 2002. Dividends paid in 2004 and 2003 were $66 million and $60 million, respectively. On May 28, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock, an increase of $0.01 per share over the previous dividend payment. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2004 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 10, 2004. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we intend to evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year. Other Liquidity Information. We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. CAPITAL RESOURCES Despite the recent decrease in capital spending, our operations remain capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment, package-handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including preexisting contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities. The following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in millions): Percent Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/ 2003 2003/ 2002 Aircraft and related equipment $ 372 $ 762 $ 730 (51 ) 4 Facilities and sort equipment 332 254 292 31 (13 ) Information technology investments 249 273 288 (9 ) (5 ) Vehicles and other equipment 318 222 305 43 (27 ) Total capital expenditures $ 1,271 $ 1,511 $ 1,615 (16 ) (6 ) FedEx Express segment $ 592 $ 917 $ 1,069 (35 ) (14 ) FedEx Ground segment 314 252 214 25 18 FedEx Freight segment 130 139 86 (6 ) 62 FedEx Kinko's segment 36 — — n/a n/a Other 199 203 246 (2 ) (17 ) Total capital expenditures $ 1,271 $ 1,511 $ 1,615 (16 ) (6 ) Capital expenditures were 16% lower in 2004, with the year-over-year decrease due to lower aircraft expenditures at FedEx Express, partially offset by an increase from network capacity expansion at FedEx Ground. Capital expenditures were 6% lower during 2003. This decrease was primarily at the FedEx Express segment, where capital expenditures were 14% lower. We continued to make investments in FedEx Ground's infrastructure and information technology, and we also made capital investments to expand FedEx Freight. 50 Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.65 billion in 2005, with much of the year-over-year increase coming from planned aircraft expenditures at FedEx Express to support IP volume growth. We also continue to invest in infrastructure upgrades and scanning technologies, the multi-year capacity expansion of the FedEx Ground network, expansion of the FedEx Kinko's network and replacement vehicle needs at FedEx Freight. Because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft, we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance. Therefore, we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements years before aircraft are actually needed. We are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible, while continuing to invest strategically in growing business segments. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2004. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, this table does not include amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at May 31, 2004. Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 There- after Total (in millions) Amounts reflected in Balance Sheet: Long-term debt(1) $ 613 $ 265 $ 844 $ — $ 499 $ 832 $ 3,053 Capital lease obligations(2) 160 122 22 99 11 225 639 Other cash obligations not reflected in Balance Sheet: Unconditional purchase obligations(3) 601 255 252 212 643 1,439 3,402 Operating leases 1,707 1,555 1,436 1,329 1,169 7,820 15,016 Total $ 3,081 $ 2,197 $ 2,554 $ 1,640 $ 2,322 $ 10,316 $ 22,110 (1)Amounts do not include related interest. See Note 6 for the applicable interest rates. (2)Capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments. (3)See Note 17 to the accompanying audited financial statements. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table above. Amounts Reflected in Balance Sheet We have other commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are used in the normal course of international operations. While the notional amounts of these instruments are material, there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet. 51 We have certain operating leases that were arranged using variable interest entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry. As discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we consolidated one of these entities in the second quarter of 2004 in accordance with FIN 46. As a result of this consolidation, the accompanying audited May 31, 2004 balance sheet includes an additional $126 million of fixed assets and $133 million of long-term liabilities, and the payment of these debt obligations is included in the table above. FedEx Express amended two leases for MD11 aircraft during 2004, which required FedEx Express to record $110 million in both fixed assets and long-term liabilities. During 2003, FedEx Express amended four leases for MD11 aircraft, which now commits FedEx Express to firm purchase obligations for two of these aircraft during both 2005 and 2006. As a result, the amended leases were accounted for as capital leases, which added $221 million to both fixed assets and long-term liabilities at May 31, 2003. The future payments of these capital lease obligations are reflected in the table above. We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2005 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Balance Sheet The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services. Such contracts include those for certain purchases of aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles, facilities, computers, printing and other equipment and advertising and promotions contracts. Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2004. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of ""off-balance sheet financing""). At the time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after-tax cash flows. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. Credit rating agencies routinely use this information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. In addition, we have guarantees under certain operating leases, amounting to $43 million as of May 31, 2004, for the residual values of vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods. Based upon our expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees. In the future, other forms of secured financing and direct purchases may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine that they best suit our needs. We have been successful in obtaining investment capital, both domestic and international, for long-term leases on acceptable terms, although the 52 marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm. PENSION COST We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees. The accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates, including: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; and employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages. The determination of our annual pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates because we have a large, active workforce and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans. For example, only 6% of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits and the average remaining service life of our employees approximates 14 years (normal retirement is at age 60). Therefore, the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future. This long-time period increases the sensitivity of our annual pension cost to changes in these key estimates. Total pension cost increased approximately $115 million in 2004 and approximately $80 million in 2003 primarily due to changes to these estimates. For 2005 we expect a smaller increase (approximately $30 million), as 2004 actual asset returns have substantially improved the funded status of our pension plans in spite of a continued decline in the discount rate. Pension cost is included in the salaries and employee benefits caption in our income statements. Following are the components of pension cost recognized in our income statements (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Service cost $ 376 $ 374 $ 348 Interest cost 490 438 409 Expected return on plan assets (597 ) (594 ) (621 ) Net amortization and deferral 74 10 13 $ 343 $ 228 $ 149 53 Following is a discussion of the estimates we consider most critical to determining our pension costs: Discount Rate. This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date (the projected benefit obligation) to their net present value. The discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date (end of February) and affects the succeeding year's pension cost. A decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive for us as a one-basis-point change in the discount rate at February 29, 2004 affects our 2005 pension expense by approximately $1.8 million and our 2004 accumulated benefit obligation by approximately $11 million. For example, the 21-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 6.78% for 2005 from 6.99% for 2004 will negatively affect our 2005 pension cost by approximately $38 million. Our 2004 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $20 million by the 12-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 6.99% for 2004 from 7.11% for 2003. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments. This methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity. However, the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds. Plan Assets. Pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities. Our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is intended to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. At February 29, 2004, with over $7.7 billion of plan assets, a one-basis-point change in this assumption affects pension cost by approximately $750,000 (a decrease in the assumed expected long-term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense). Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption: •the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets. •the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next 10- to 15-year time period (or such other time period that may be appropriate). •the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. Also, we periodically commission detailed asset/liability studies performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability-adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The study performed for 2003 supported the reasonableness of our 10.10% return assumption used for 2003 based on our liability duration and market conditions at the time we set this assumption (in 2002). 54 Because of the introduction of the Portable Pension Account (discussed below) for 2004 (which will reduce our liability duration over time), as well as the significant additional contributions we made into the plans in late 2003 and the continuing deterioration of the equity markets through February 28, 2003, we performed a more recent asset/liability study for 2004, which supported a long-term return on assets of 9.10%. The results of this study were reaffirmed for 2005 by our third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries and support our current asset allocation strategy, which is summarized below: Asset Class Target % of Plan Assets Domestic equities 53 % International equities 17 Private equities 5 Total equities 75 Long duration fixed income securities 15 Other fixed income securities 10 100 % Our allocation of assets at February 29, 2004 approximates the target allocation above. Our actual compound return on assets was 9.4% for the 15-year period ended March 31, 2004. Based on these factors, we will retain 9.10% as our estimated future rate of return on pension assets for 2005. The 100-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return for 2004 negatively affected our 2004 pension cost by approximately $65 million. Our 2003 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $48 million by the 80-basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return to 10.10% for 2003 from 10.90% for 2002. Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value method to determine the value of plan assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases). Another method used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date. The application of the calculated-value method reduced 2004 and 2003 pension cost by approximately $106 million and $35 million, respectively. Application of the calculated-value method will approximate the market-value method in 2005. Salary Increases. The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost. We correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages). For 2005 pension cost, a one-basis-point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension cost by approximately $900,000 (a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost). This assumption varies directly with the discount rate changes (reflecting general inflation trends); however, the current rate is deemed to be at or near the floor based on current pay structures and improving company performance. Therefore, we will hold this assumption constant for determination of 2005 pension cost. The decrease in this assumption to 3.15% for 2004 from 3.25% favorably impacted 2004 pension cost by approximately $10 million. 55 Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of May 31, 2004 and 2003 (in millions): 2004 2003 Funded Status of Plans: Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO): Qualified U.S. domestic plans $ 7,069 $ 5,725 Other plans 358 284 Total ABO $ 7,427 $ 6,009 Projected benefit obligation (PBO) $ 8,683 $ 7,117 Fair value of plan assets 7,783 5,825 PBO in excess of plan assets (900 ) (1,292 ) Unrecognized actuarial losses, principally due to investments and changes in discount rate 1,694 2,247 Unamortized prior service cost and other 113 116 Amounts Included in Balance Sheets $ 907 $ 1,071 Components of Amounts Included in Balance Sheets: Prepaid pension cost $ 1,127 $ 1,269 Accrued pension liability (220 ) (198 ) Minimum pension liability (67 ) (42 ) Intangible asset and other 67 42 Net amounts recognized in balance sheets $ 907 $ 1,071 Cash Amounts: Cash contributions during the year $ 335 $ 1,072 Benefit payments during the year $ 136 $ 103 The funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date. Declining interest rates (which increase the discounted value of the PBO) and recent fluctuations in the stock market have significantly impacted the funded status of our plans. However, our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for 2004 were less than 2% of plan assets at May 31, 2004). Although not legally required, we made $320 million in contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans in 2004 compared to total contributions exceeding $1 billion in 2003. Our 2003 contributions were made to ensure our qualified pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our February 28, 2003 plan measurement date. Currently, we do not expect any contributions for 2005 will be legally required. Based on the substantial improvement in the funded status of our qualified plans, we do not currently expect to contribute any funds to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2005. Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately $1.7 billion through February 29, 2004, improved from $2.2 billion at February 28, 2003. These unrecognized losses primarily reflect the declining discount rate and the declining stock market during 2003, 2002 and 2001. These amounts may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, to the extent that the discount rate remains low and market performance does not continue to improve, these unrecognized actuarial losses may be recognized in future periods. 56 The net amounts reflected in our balance sheet related to pension items include a substantial prepaid pension asset. This results from excess cash contributions to the plans over amounts that are recognized as pension expense for financial accounting purposes. Amounts accrued as liabilities (including minimum pension liabilities) relate primarily to unfunded nonqualified plans and international pension plans where additional funding may not provide a current tax deduction. Effective in 2004, we amended the FedEx Corporation Employees' Pension Plan to add a cash balance feature, which we call the Portable Pension Account. We expect the Portable Pension Account will help reduce the long-term growth of our pension liabilities. All employees hired after May 31, 2003 will accrue benefits under the Portable Pension Account formula. Eligible employees as of May 31, 2003 were able to choose between continuing to accrue benefits under the traditional pension benefit formula or accruing future benefits under the Portable Pension Account formula. The election was entirely optional. There was no conversion of existing accrued benefits to a cash balance. All benefits earned through May 31, 2003, including those applicable to employees electing the Portable Pension Account, will be determined under a traditional pension plan formula. Accordingly, it will be several years before the impact of the lower benefit provided under this formula has a significant impact on our total pension expense. Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service and interest on the notional account balance. An employee's pay credits will be determined each year under a graded formula that combines age with years of service for points. The plan interest credit rate will vary from year to year based on the selected U.S. Treasury maturity, with a 4% minimum and a maximum based on the government rate. Employees are fully vested on completion of five years of service. SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long-term disability programs. At May 31, 2004 there were approximately $1.03 billion of self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet ($937 million at May 31, 2003). The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. 57 LONG-LIVED ASSETS Property and Equipment. Our key businesses are capital intensive. More than 45% of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. However, consistent with industry practice, we capitalize certain aircraft-related costs on one of our aircraft fleet types and amortize these costs over their estimated service lives. The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than $10 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control. No material changes to the estimated lives and residual values were made during 2004. At various times during 2003, as studies were completed, we made changes to the useful lives and residual values of certain aircraft fleet types, as well as tractors, trailers and other equipment. These changes resulted in a decrease in 2003 depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Had all of these changes been made as of June 1, 2002, depreciation expense for 2003 would have decreased by an additional $12 million. Because we must plan years in advance for future volume levels and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections, we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. There were no material asset impairment charges recognized in 2004, 2003 or 2002. Leases. We utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft and FedEx Kinko's locations. Over the years, we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in ""Contractual Cash Obligations"" and Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements, at May 31, 2004 we had approximately $15 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates 58 primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions. Goodwill. We have approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses, which includes approximately $1.7 billion from our acquisition of FedEx Kinko's in 2004. New accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization. As previously indicated, the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of $25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses. The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology. In particular, the following estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test: revenue growth rates; operating margin; discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Each year, independent of our goodwill impairment test, we update our weighted-average cost of capital calculation and perform a long-range planning analysis to project expected results of operations. Using this data, we complete a separate fair-value analysis for each of our reporting units. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. We compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of those units. Since the acquisition of FedEx Kinko's occurred near the end of 2004, we did not test its goodwill for impairment in 2004. We will include the related goodwill in our 2005 annual impairment test, which, unless circumstances otherwise dictate, will be performed in the fourth quarter of 2005. We performed our annual impairment tests in 2004 and 2003 for our other reporting units. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of those units; therefore, no impairment charge was necessary. Intangible Asset with an Indefinite Life. The estimated fair value of our intangible asset with an indefinite life was $567 million, consisting of the estimated fair value allocated to the Kinko's trade name. This intangible asset will not be amortized because it has an indefinite remaining useful life based on the length of time that the Kinko's name had been in use, the Kinko's brand awareness and market position and the plans for continued use of the Kinko's brand. We must review this asset for impairment on an annual basis. This annual evaluation requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows attributable to the Kinko's trade name to determine the estimated fair value of the trade name. Changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect this estimate. However, once an impairment of this intangible asset has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we plan to perform our first annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005. REVENUE RECOGNITION We believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace. Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments, as well as providing document solutions and business services. Our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational, billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and collect amounts due to us. 59 We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or, for our business services, logistics and trade services businesses, upon the completion of services. Transportation industry practice includes two predominant methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period: (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. We use the second method; we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred. There are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above: (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts. Unbilled Revenue. Primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers, there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice. At the end of a month, unprocessed invoices may be as much as one-third of the total month's revenue. This revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes. Invoices that are essentially complete represent most of these accruals, with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued. The remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced. Because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes, the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced. Shipments in Process. The majority of our shipments have short cycle times; therefore, less than 5% of a total month's revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period. We periodically perform studies to measure the percentage of completion for shipments in process. At month-end, we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our average price for the respective services. We believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period. Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts Receivable. Like many companies, we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable. Historically, our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective. We also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money-back service guarantees and billing corrections. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts, adjustments processed and current collections trends. Total allowances for these future adjustments were $151 million at May 31, 2004 and $149 million at May 31, 2003. We consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances. 60 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report, including (but not limited to) those contained in ""Business Realignment Costs,"" ""FedEx Kinko's Acquisition,"" ""Airline Stabilization Compensation,"" ""Outlook,"" ""Reportable Segments,"" ""Liquidity,"" ""Capital Resources,"" ""Contractual Cash Obligations"" and ""Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,"" are ""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, plans, objectives, future performance and business of FedEx.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed on the majority of our long-term debt. We had approximately $730 million of outstanding floating-rate borrowings at May 31, 2004. We have not employed interest rate hedging to mitigate the risks with respect to these borrowings. A hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rate on our outstanding floating-rate borrowings would not have a material effect on our results of operations. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we had outstanding fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of capital leases) of $2.3 billion at May 31, 2004 and $1.6 billion at May 31, 2003. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $49 million as of May 31, 2004 and $39 million as of May 31, 2003. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce and business services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the Japanese yen, Taiwan dollar, Canadian dollar and euro. During 2004 and 2003, we believe operating income was positively impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services. At May 31, 2004, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $79 million for 2005 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately $36 million). This increase is primarily due to the strong growth of our international operations. This theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. We have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges. In 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating U.S. domestic fuel surcharges, which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel. In 2003, we implemented this methodology for determining a fuel surcharge on international shipments as well. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel surcharges. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in our fuel surcharges. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 63",2023-12-30 20:49:38.525901
